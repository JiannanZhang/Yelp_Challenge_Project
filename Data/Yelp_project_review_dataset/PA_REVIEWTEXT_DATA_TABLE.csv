"PA","Cold cheap beer. Good bar food. Good service. 

Looking for a great Pittsburgh style fish sandwich, this is the place to go. The breading is light, fish is more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fries. 

Good grilled chicken salads or steak.  Soup of day is homemade and lots of specials. Great place for lunch or bar snacks and beer."
"PA","Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent."
"PA","We checked this place out this past Monday for their wing night. We have heard that their wings are great and decided it was finally time to check it out. Their wings are whole wings and crispy, which is a nice change of pace. I got their wet Cajun sauce and garlic butter wings. The Cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin. The sauce was also thin for the garlic butter, but that is more expected. They were better than average, but I don't like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat. I would definitely come try this place out again to sample some of the other items on the menu, but this will probably not become a regular stop for wings anytime soon."
"PA","All the food is great here. But the best thing they have is their wings. Their wings are simply fantastic!!  The ""Wet Cajun"" are by the best & most popular.  I also like the seasoned salt wings.  Wing Night is Monday & Wednesday night, $0.75 whole wings!

The dining area is nice. Very family friendly! The bar is very nice is well.  This place is truly a Yinzer's dream!!  ""Pittsburgh Dad"" would love this place n'at!!"
"PA","I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak.  It re-opens on July 14th and I can't wait to take my kids.  The new range looks amazing.  The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course.  Can't wait to experience it!"
"PA","Before I finally made it over to this range I heard the same thing from most people - it's just fine to go work on your swing. I had such a low expectation I was pleasantly surprised. 

It's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. 

The guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. 

A big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....

Price for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again."
"PA","This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available, including all the grass tees.  It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be."
"PA","Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.

Bottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh."
"PA","Decent range somewhat close to the city.  The mats are pretty solid; however, the grass range needs to be tended too.  It's like hitting out of US Open type rough...not very amenable to practicing.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf range...Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?)."
"PA","I visited this store several months ago to simply ask about smartphone plans. The agent was pleasant and helpful. I would recommend a visit to this store."
"PA","After waiting for almost 30 minutes to trade in an old phone part of the buy back program, our customer service rep incorrectly processed the transaction. This led to us waiting another 30 minutes for him to correct it. Don't visit this store if you want pleasant or good service."
"PA","THANK YOU ROB! i truly appreciated all the help i received from this agent today who was able to removed the extra charges on my bill that the Pasadena Verizon Store on Lake was charging me on my bill for upgrading my phone.   When i went in i was having problems with my Blacberry and had to switch to the Iphone last week. Rob from the Pennsylvania store who i was connected today was able to look at my bill and all the notes and correct the problem immediately. Great Customer Service! He even set up a FOLLOW UP Phone Call with me On July 5th to make sure the credit goes through on my bill...I can't thank him enough!!!!"
"PA","This is a hidden gem, no really. It took us forever to find but well worth it. It is right across the street from the Rankin Police Station. The menu has a wide selection, I really couldn't decide what I wanted but I went with the ribeye sandwich. I'm glad i did too. Huge sandwich! I added mushrooms, it was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the fish sandwich, he enjoyed it as well. Fast and friendly service. Will definitely be back."
"PA","After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.

Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.

And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.

So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. 

We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'

This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.

Oh...but good food counts too. 

We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!

My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...

The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. 

They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.

Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.

You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.

Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh."
"PA","Good fish sandwich."
"PA","Wonderful reuben.  Map shown on Yelp page is incorrect. It is actually a different Hawkins.  I'd recommend a call for directions 412-271-9911."
"PA","Seen this restaurant on 25 best places in Pittsburgh with Rick Seback
ack. Went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner. She's very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the Ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices. Going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty."
"PA","Old school.....traditional ""mom 'n pop"" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it."
"PA","This place was very good. I found out about Emil's when watching a show called ""25 Things I Love About Pittsburgh"" on WQED hosted by Rick Seback. This place ain't a luxurious restaurant...it's a beer & a shot bar / lounge. But the people are friendly & the food is good. I had the fish sandwich which was great. It ain't in a great part of town, Rankin, but I've been in worse places!! Try this place."
"PA","This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.

Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. 

The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.

-Fish Sandwiich
-Salmon (huge and delicious)
-Flounder
-Shrimp a few ways (""Norfolk"" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)
-Hawkins St Special
-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)

The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem."
"PA","Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh."
"PA","This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's ""25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh"" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays."
"PA","We met a couple of friends there on a Friday afternoon about 440 pm, based on the Yelp reviews. I've relied on Yelp in over a dozen different cities, never came away with anything less than a positive experience until today. 

We ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down, there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place, counting the people on the patio.  Took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad. I tried the fish sandwich, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok. I've had better at almost any church that fries fish during Lent. 

All 3 of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten. Bread french fries and onion rings were good though. Iced tea was good, though I've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. Asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.

I may give the place another try in the future for a Reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that. Waitress was pretty good, held up under my multiple requests to find out if they caught my fish yet, hardly ever rolled her eyes :)"
"PA","The sandwiches, the wings, enough said. Alexions can best be described as a home-style Primantis before they went mega commercial. You really can't go wrong, but for my money, I would put Alexions fish sandwich up with the best I've had. That's not to take away from other selections, but if you come here I recommend not leaving until you've had either the fish sandwich, Reuben, or wings. 

You'll know you're in a Pittsburgh bar when you walk in. For someone who lives in Atlanta now and only makes it to Pittsburgh a few times a year, I have to say it is refreshing. Feels like home. I haven't had a trip back without making it out to Alexions at least once."
"PA","Let there be no question: Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. Try a burger on Italian bread. The service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings? Oh the wings... but it's still about the cheeseburger. The atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. Grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! Easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in Pittsburgh."
"PA","Very disappointed in the customer service. We ordered Reuben's  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. They charged us $3.00 for the coleslaw. We will not be back . The iced tea is also terrible tasting."
"PA","Grew up near here. the family would always go once a month. Haven't stopped in for a few years until last Friday with a few friends to grab a drink. The sandwiches are always amazing just as I remember. The staff is amazing and friendly. Great place for lunch as well."
"PA","Good beer selection. Understaffed for a light Monday night crowd, it wasn't her fault she was the only server. But it took about an hour to get our sandwiches. Mine was one of the best reubens I've ever had."
"PA","Awesome drink specials during happy hour. Fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious, wing night on Tuesday and Thursday!"
"PA","What a cool bar/restaurant.. I will no doubt be visiting again.  The service and prices were great.. and the restrooms were clean.   I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious.  The menu consists of typical bar food food, however; theres a few different items on there which stand out on the menu..

A cool bar off the beaten path that is a worth a trip.  

Cheers ! !"
"PA","Good for cheap drinks and wings, they offer daily specials which is nice. 

Doesnt look like much from outside but the inside is friendly enough, the bartenders have been there for awhile and do a good job. Dont expect to have a HUGE selection of alcohol. 

Their wings are good as are their salads. If you are gluten free this is not your place...lots of fried food and sandwiches. 
Offers a quick lunch."
"PA","Alexion's has been around forever.  The first time I went in there, I was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill.  All of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and I immediately found out why.  MANY, MANY years later, I stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who I was.  THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.  I recall that some of the sandwiches I got there were ordered at a pretty late hour.  Nothing but good things to say about the place, and I wish it was closer to home!"
"PA","A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. 

The staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.

We ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!

My advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know."
"PA","This would be my local haunt, if I were ever to relocate to the Pittsburgh area. What a great little place! Such friendly staff, and some damn good eats!
 
It was so great, that we actually went there twice during our 4-day vacation to catch the Steelers/Ravens game. 

They have daily sandwich specials. On Thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand., and the .35 cent wings. Very, very tasty. I'm sorry, but this place kicks Primanti Bros. butt on the taste factor. They have about 8 different types of wings... reg., garlic, and I can't remember the rest - we got the regular, and I was wishing we would had ordered more.

Going back on a Friday night, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n' mushroom.  Wow! That buffalo chicken pizza was awesome.

The other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers. An older gentleman; he seemed to be a regular. I really, really wanted his SPAM t-shirt."
"PA","I got 'new' tires from them and within two weeks got a flat. I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. 
I took the tire over to Flynn's and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he'd give me a new tire ""this time"". 
I will never go back to Flynn's b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!"
"PA","Used to go there for tires, brakes, etc.  Their prices have gone way up-$400 for 4 mid-level tires for a Toyota.  Plus, 1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks.  Since they don""t make appointments,  the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours.  Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair,  They lost my business for good."
"PA","Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They ""fixed"" it for free, and the very next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain, and the ""manager"" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too."
"PA","Contrary to other reviews, I have zero complaints about the service or the prices. I have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now, and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys, these guys are experienced and know what they're doing. 
Also, this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of, just because of my gender. Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry. But here, my service and road coverage has all been well explained - and let up to me to decide. 
And they just renovated the waiting room. It looks a lot better than it did in previous years."
"PA","Terrible. Preordered my tires and when I arrived they couldn't find the order anywhere. Once we got through that process I waited over 2 hours for them to be put on... I was originally told it would take 30 mins. Slow, over priced, I'll go elsewhere next time."
"PA","I've been informed by a fellow Yelper that they are just closed for the season, I hope they're right! I find it strange they don't keep their phone number in service with a recording and that they didn't cover the course up to protect it from weather, vandalism, etc. Either way, I can't wait to get my game on in the spring!"
"PA","I think this place is closed. Their number is out of service, sign is gone and the course has not been maintained. Awesome woodsy mess of a course though!"
"PA","This quaint mini golf course is one of the oldest, yet most original and fun locations that I have yet visited.  Coming from Texas, it was nice to see a course located amongst the hilly and woody Pennsylvanian terrain. It can be frustrating that it is literally impossible to make a hole-in-one on most every hole and that the course also makes it extremely difficult to predict the direction on how the ball will follow through and bounce.  The cartoon-like outrageousness of the course proved to give laughs and a fun attempt to play.  Improvements were being made and I will look forward to returning on my next visit to the Pittsburgh area.  I enjoy traveling and visiting new courses and the only reason why I didn't give this location 5 stars is because it was impossible to intuitively shoot the ball for a best effort to beat par."
"PA","Most random location for a mini golf course ever.  This is old school. It's built into the woods (spray yourself for bugs first) right off Forsythe Rd near Carnegie Park.  The candy hut is fun to spend your spare change.  They recently re-carpeted the holes and added a few gimmicks that weren't there before.  It won't knock your socks off, but if you're local, give it a try!"
"PA","When I wanted a deck for the back of my home I ended up calling Quaker State Construction. It ended up working very well and they were very polite. I got an estimate and called them to start working out the details of my new deck. Once we got the plans all sorted out they started building my new deck and it was finished with in a reasonable amount of time. I now have a beautiful deck that I can relax and that my family can enjoy. Overall, they did a good job and I would use them in the future for all my deck necessities."
"PA","I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.

Why two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.

He told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.

Here's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.

So our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.

A month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. 

I completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.

Finally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! 

I was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said ""there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow."" Well, that didn't happen.

Then two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. 

Finally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.

My main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.

Even though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone."
"PA","Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing."
"PA","thisis not the closest Kings to us, but we often will travel the extra miles because the service and food at this location is always the best."
"PA","I arrived around 10 am on a Saturday morning.  I was greeted by the hostess,who was polite and friendly, and I informed her that I was alone.  She had just arrived, as well, and wasn't exactly sure what was going on yet, so she asked (the manager?) where she should seat me.  After receiving guidance, she brought me to a table towards the back.  It had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined.  So, she quickly got it cleared off, grabbed a rag, and wiped it down.

The waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order.  She was extremely friendly.  I ordered coffee and water, which she went and got while I looked over the menu.  She returned, and took my order.  I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Special - Three slices of French toast made with Pittsburgh's own Jenny Lee® Cinnamon Swirl, two farm-fresh eggs, with bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and your choice of potato (I went with the cheesy hash brown casserole).  I also added an orange juice.  She went and put my order in, while I waited, and came back with it after not too long.   The eggs were cooked exactly how I wanted them, the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious.  I also enjoyed the sausage which was pretty typical.

Kings Family Restaurant featured a very friendly staff, great prices, and tasty food.  I am pleased and will definitely come back again."
"PA","I heart King's. I've always been a fan and this one was as good as my old one in Monaca."
"PA","Hoofah."
"PA","Ive pretty much been eating at various Kings' pretty regularly since I was a child when my parents would take my sister and I into the Fox Chapel location often.  Lately me and my girl have been visiting the Heidelburg location. I love the food, it really tastes homemade, much like something a grandmother would make, complete with gobs of butter and side dishes. Prices are low, selection is great, but dont expect fine dining by any means. 

Service is hit or miss at pretty much all of them; if you have lunch at any Kings, you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game. Seek out this lady.  My experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.

Im in my 30s now, and very little has changed, other than the Fox Chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look less like a diner, which was a big fail.  Any girl I meet has to enjoy Kings or she's out."
"PA","So... back in the late 90s, there used to be this super-kick-ass cinnamon ice cream, like an apple pie ice cream without the apples or the pie crust.  SO DELICIOUS!

However, NOW there is some shit-tastic replacement that tastes like vanilla ice cream with last year's red-hot in the middle: totally gross.  Fortunately, our server was nice enough to warn me about the change and bring me a sample, so I only had to suffer the death of a childhood memory rather than also having to pay for it.

The portions are big and filling, just don't come for the ice cream."
"PA","I have never seen a restaurant that has a frowning brownie (a.k.a. Frownie) as their icon, mascot, or spokesperson.  King's Family Restaurant has surprised me with this.  I think it might be in direct dialogue with Eat N' Parks smiling cookie -- funny (funny odd, not funny ha-ha).  We were seated rather quickly by the manager.  Very nice people work here, I was happy to find that even though they had closed a section, the server was willing to stay longer to serve us our dinner.

We chatted with the server a little bit -- she was quite engaging -- and then moved on to order our meal:

Tea
Pepsi
Open-faced Hot Turkey Sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy
Buffalo Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n' cheese

Our drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area.  She would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed.  Eventually, our entrees arrived -- both piping hot.  I went straight for the macaroni and cheese.  It didn't taste bad, but I swear that it is made by Stouffers.  I didn't feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat.  I tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but, again, they didn't taste bad with the brown gravy.  I moved on to the main part of my meal -- the buffalo chicken strips.  At least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild.  I contented myself with eating them.  

I tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it was not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated.  I finished off my dinner and was happy in the end.  No, it wasn't the best food in the world, but the service greatly helped the perception and it didn't taste bad."
"PA","Not bad for a Shop N Save, most are privately owned, so availability of items might differ from place to place. The only time I frequent S n S is when the have their huge two day sales usually held on Thursday and Friday at least once month.

Good bakery at this location too."
"PA","Average run of the mill store.  Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.  Found my puppy treats and moved on."
"PA","Italian dinners, American, endless soup and salad bar is great. Most food for your dollar. I highly recommend. Great bar. Good place to watch a game. The bar can get quite noisy in the evenings, but it adds to the great atmosphere at Rocky's"
"PA","Rocky's has been in business since the 1980s and still going strong.  Their food is good.  Not haute cuisine, pretentious!  Everyday, well prepared and taste bud pleasing home style cooking.  I've mostly gone during supper hours and  and ate in the dining room, but, today I introduced an old friend to ""linner"" in the bar.
He ordered the large version of fish sandwich.  Rocky's is famous for their fish.  Three large breaded and fried fish filets, bun and fries for under $10.  Needless to say, he had no complaints and brought home more than he ate.
I ordered the meatball grill.  It was delish.  Served on thick cut Italian bread and made ""grilled cheese"" (mozzarella) style.  Meatballs and tomato sauce are both good!  Also, served with fries.  I brought home half the sandwich.
Another good meal there.  Friends, mother, and former boss all enjoy their food!"
"PA","If you are searching for a go to fish place for Lent....look no further.  This place will give you the best fish sandwich in Pittsburgh.  The sandwich has enough fish to make four sandwiches.  You will not be able to finish this sandwich in one seating.
Enjoy...."
"PA","everything was great!"
"PA","Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.

On the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.

Well, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.

The second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.

I was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.

We hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.

The mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. 

After the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. 

Well, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.

Thank goodness for the basic salad bar.

Even my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.

The irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.

Third base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.

From what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen."
"PA","A fine breakfast joint. You gotta love the small diners. Highly recommended."
"PA","What a find! I stopped in here for breakfast while in town for business. The service is so friendly I thought I was down south. The service was quick, frankly and felt like I was with family. 
Fantastic poached eggs, Cajun homefries and crispy bacon. Gab and Eat is definitely a place I world recommend to locals. I was stuffed and the bill was only $8.00."
"PA","Excellent breakfast and lunch menu. Friendly staff and super food. Modest environment with excellent food. Worth the wait.. dont miss this one. 
Best breakfast and lunch food in the Pgh South Hills hands down."
"PA","A gem. The coffee cups are mismatched . The owner is three feet away from me cooking. The sausage is made for them locally. And the food is frickin awesome. I had the pancakes, my daughter had the sausage and egg sandwich.  Cash only.  Friendly service."
"PA","I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch)."
"PA","Wow! Read the great reviews and I was not let down. Huge portions. The mixed grill was THE best breakfast I've ever had. If you go to Pittsburgh it is a must eat. Service was superb. Friendly staff. Led zeppelin on the walls. .....what else could you ask for?"
"PA","This is a perfect example of what a breakfast diner can be: excellent breakfasts in huge portions for cheap. I had the western omlet and will be getting it or another omlet again soon

The coffee was good, totally serviceable diner coffee. The waitress was wonderfully friendly and hopping around from table to table. The food was excellent. The ambience was exactly right for a diner. It was packed. The wait was not nearly as long as I was expecting. 10 minutes maybe.

Totally recommended. Come hungry."
"PA","Met my nephew for lunch in Carnegie and he suggested Gab & Eat.   Way to go Justin!  The restaurant is in a strip mall across from the Dairy Queen.  The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn't throw the food when it came!   She also served the fries and Onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   They were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   It didn't factor into my four star rating but I deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   Just kidding Justin!   Love ya!"
"PA","On our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try Gab & Eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in Pittsburgh area. We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.
We arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.
Inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.
The waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.
After reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. 
His bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.
The Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?
Everything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.
My only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.
It usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.
Coffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.
While I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had."
"PA","This is exactly what a breakfast place should be like--comfortable, quirky, unpretentious and with inexpensive, large portioned working class breakfast plates."
"PA","I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. 

This place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.""  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.

We want to return sometime for ""turkey day.""  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!

Can't wait to return."
"PA","Great breakfast, good price. You might have to stand outside in line though, so I don't really recommend winter time to go. lol. Very friendly service, interesting coffee mugs. They have great deserts and such also. Bring your cash though as they dont' take cards."
"PA","Best breakfast spot in the area, If you like diner food it is the place to go. Small, so you will want to avoid the church crowd on Sundays, but the wait is never too long.  Everyone is friendly and has obviously been working there for a while.  If you are feeling like lunch food go a little later, their burgers are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious."
"PA","Yum - freaking - me!

As the other fellower yelpers mentioned - this place is a cash only.    A couple of recommendations:

- Don't eat early in the week 
- I don't recommend wearing any tight clothing (no skinny jeans) - you will not be skinny when you leave


 I walked in for breakfast one early weekday AM.   The place was packed with locals and regulars.    A very good sign.

My co-worker recommended I get the mixed grill.   I ordered the large mix grill.   My waitress tried to warn me - it is large (very large).    I ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.

Food - 

The Mixed Grill comprises their homemade sausage, grilled onions, grilled peppers, potatoes, fried eggs.     

Portion -

This should have been a man vs food episode.   I was not going to attempt to eat all the food.   It was really good.

Service - 

My waitress looks as if she had been working there for years.   She was fast, friendly, and offered good advice.

Price - 

The cost ranges $5 - 10.


I will definitely go back after I buy some new stretchy pants."
"PA","Classic breakfast joint.  Grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall.  Window is opaque due to the grease so you can't hardly see inside. On the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in.  When you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life.

What's the attraction behind this flea hole?  The FOOD!  Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.  Cash only, so put that plastic away.

Only bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the Food Network or Travel Channel will make this place famous, and then I'll never be able to get in."
"PA","Readers of my reviews may recall that I once referred to The Dor-Stop as possibly the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.

I easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  

When my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   

In case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, ""We need mugs"" just makes me love this place even more.

A few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You'll be glad you did!"
"PA","Great Diner!  Their breakfast is the best in the area!  Lots of  choices and always good.  Love the unique mugs they use for coffee and all the writing on the wall.  Get there early otherwise you will not get a seat!  They have homemade hot/sweet sausage and texas toast."
"PA","Best French toast ever!! Love the friendly atmosphere, and especially the breakfast. Never been disappointed. You have to try French toast with raisin bread too... yummy!"
"PA","BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.

It's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana."
"PA","OK, what is with all of these ""CASH ONLY"" places in Pittsburgh? I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. 

Looking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can't even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie! I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome! The cherries were not the sweet canned variety, but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar. I think I want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree!

My first impression is ""Eh.""  I am learning how crazy Pittsburghers are over breakfast! Seriously, waiting 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows:  

""2 eggs and toast $x.xx""
""2 eggs, meat, and toast $x.xx""
""2 eggs and pancake $x.xx""

I'd rather go to a Denny's and order the ""create your own Grand Slam!"""
"PA","Great breakfast place. Come hungry. Look for Dick, my dad, and Gino at the counter every a.m. about 0830 and say hi. Try the mixed grill (half)."
"PA","Great homemade hot breakfast sausage and a wonderful family restaurant feel. 

Reminds me of the one my parents used to own in Mi. 

Have fun finding a table on the weekend :)"
"PA","If you're looking for no frills but a great breakfast this is the place. I got the mixed grill half portion and was very full. Make sure you have extra calories for the day because they are not afraid to use butter. Loved the breakfast and would go back. Not much room for sitting down but worth the wait."
"PA","Definitely a greasy spoon! Always packed here and always a wait but worth it. The omelets are really tastey especially with their homemade sausage. I also like the mixed grill.  My parents love their burgers. Took off a star for lumpy booths and really tight tables (your arm gets hit when someone walks past) oh and waitresses aren't very attentive."
"PA","My favorite breakfast place.  Have good sandwiches also.  Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real MAN!  Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  

Have had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!

Lunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.

Gets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait.

Remember it is a diner.  Don't expect fancy decor."
"PA","Love this place.  Never had a bad meal.  Good portions and great people.  Be ready to stand in line."
"PA","I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I've found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. 

Here are the highlights:

-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.
-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)
-Cash only
-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack
-About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.
-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo"
"PA","I miss this place. When I return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before. When I think of pittsburgh, I remember cutting morning classes in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of. Honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner, and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint. Go here and you will be happy you did."
"PA","Okay, let's first set expectations.  This place is a true DIVE...this is not for the NYC foodie crowd.  If you want a down home, large portion awesome breakfast, this is the place.  The place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  The best part - they have ""dippy"" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  For anyone who has never heard of a ""dippy"" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  The eggs were great - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh Italian bread.  YUM!!!"
"PA","Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country.  Simply put I LOVE it here.  The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries.  This it the very definition of diner.  Thank you Gab 'n' Eat!"
"PA","The biggest breakfast in Pittsburgh, as far as I can tell - and delicious and cheap too. I ordered some mix of eggs, bacon and pancakes - and got 2 dinner-sized plates, one loaded with pancakes and the other stuffed with eggs, bacon, and home fries. Oh, and a side of toast. For under $5, if I recall.

HUGE portions, all well-executed; as good as DeLuca's.

I've not had anything besides breakfast, so can't comment on the burger or anything else.

Cramped quarters, and you'll have to wait, but when nothing but monster morning food will do, this is the destination."
"PA","Stick to basics and this is the best place in or around the 'burgh.  First time go with a friend and sit at the counter.  Short order cooking at it's best, it's like a floor show with the actor's backs to you.  Breakfast has no losers.  Eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular mixed grill, get a 1/2 Louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and don't forget the italian toast.

Frequently voted the best burger in Pittsburgh for a reason.  As for ambiance, well lets just say I don't think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint.  But the coffee's good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good, andlocal with many long time folks working here.  If I don't get there for awhile I need to go through detox because I feel too healthy."
"PA","Good Luck getting a seat, that's all I have to say. The Gab and Eat is famous and infamous. Diner food is what's up and I like it. When I was a roofing mechanic, we'd meet there before work. Although I'm not sure I would recommend it if you're working were there's no bathrooms. hehe"
"PA","If you want a true understanding of Pittsburgh in the morning, come here. This greasy spoon is always packed, and is one of the better of its kind south of the city.

They serve waffles in halves, which is great. The eggs and toast are good, the homemade hot sausage is excellent. The drawback are the barely cooked potatoes.

If you're hungry, get ""The Mixed Grill""... Gab and Eat's brand of the ""kitchen sink"" breakfast that all Midwest places are about."
"PA","My husband and I tried this place for the first time today. It was easy to find and no problems with parking. It's ""Seat Yourself"", but there were no signs stating this, so we stood there looking like fools for a minute. It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and I'm guessing that this was Barb. She apologized and said that one of her workers called off today. No big deal and her apology was appreciated. She came back with our drinks, dropped them off, and left again. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. Ultimately, we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. This was aggravating to me. I don't mind waiting for my food if I know it's going to be awesome and they're making it with love, but come on now. We ordered the hot pepper omelette/home fries/ toast and chocolate chip pancakes/sausage. The food was alright, really nothing special. A new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive. We may or may not go back."
"PA","My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.

The food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.

The service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.

The inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.

The prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.

So in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's."
"PA","This is a great place to eat and everyone is so friendly. I live right down the street from here but unfortunately, I have only gone a once. Trust me, I will go here more often. The food is great, prices are low, and the staff are friendly. My cousin and I wanted a place to eat and catch up and this was perfect place. I will go here more often."
"PA","Great little place. Treats you like a local.Eaten here 3 times a week for a month.  Same overtime. Barb is always here."
"PA","Barb's Country Junction gets a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a Pittsburgh restaurant should be.  In addition to being the apple of my nostalgia's eye, it is also the constant thought of my tummy when I'm hungry on the weekends.  

Barb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly any meal you get there you won't regret.  Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  There's nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.

I know that Gab N Eat is nearby, and Barb's can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of Carnegie that you've gotta try!"
"PA","Tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful"
"PA","I've stayed at a couple of Extended Stay sites that I found quite satisfactory and this location proved to be just as good. Excellent place to stay while visiting Pittsburgh. It is just a five minute drive to downtown. Location is in a business park area so it is quiet. 

The rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator, sink, cabinets and two burners. There is no oven which I expected as the descriptions all state ""full kitchen"" so be aware of that. Also they do not keep the dishes, pots and pans, coffee makers, toasters or utensils in the rooms. If you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in. 

The room was clean and well maintained. Cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable. The free wifi is usually fast. 

The best part about this location was the staff. The people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile.  I would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it."
"PA","Simple
Rustic
Local
Wait that is every Gordon Ramsey review

My experience at extended Stay America was great. The staff was warm and friendly and made it a point to speak to me every morning as I left and when I returned in the evening. They went out of their way to provide A confirmation and point me in the direction of restaurants and nightspots when needed. 

If I ever need to utilize an extended stay hotel I wouldn't hesitate to head back there."
"PA","Great value, close drive to city, not much to do around hotel, its a business park. Carnegie city has a few bars and restaurants."
"PA","For the price I ended up paying, this place was fine. There was a full kitchen, king bed and TV. I was just surprised at the lack of amenities at the hotel. While I have stayed at other extended stay hotels, I was surprised to find a sign in the room at this one stating that you only got your room cleaned once per week...if you wanted it more often than that you would have to pay for it. If you needed fresh towels, you'd have to go to the main desk to get them. They also only provided a small bar of soap in the room...not the typical soap, shampoo, lotion, etc. This didn't bother me too much as I was only staying a couple days but again I found it surprising not to have these basic things. 

The hotel in general was easy to get to and very easy to get back onto to freeway from. The hotel was clean and the people who worked there were very nice."
"PA","Okay, so hopefully you haven't been enjoying happy hour @ Riley's Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners. 

To recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me?

It's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. 

My guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. 

I really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. 

Get it together, Murphy's ... er, I mean Sullivan's....er, I mean Paddy's or is it Riley's? ;  ).  Whatever the case, they have cold Guinness. And Irish music.  And fun patrons."
"PA","Best Irish food in the Burgh.  Great bar food too.  The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest, nor the best decor.  But, that's not what this place is about.  It's a town Irish bar and it serves great solid Irish fare and suds to the locals.  And it does it better than anyone.  I go back again and again."
"PA","If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no ""pies"". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that ""they were out"". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once."
"PA","Be warned. Don't expect the best service ever. It's not the cleanest place you've been in either. The decor is soccer jerseys from places and teams you've probably never heard of. It's divey, eclectic, and authentic. 

If you're looking for good Irish food and a cold pint, you can't go wrong at the Pour House. Like most of Carnegie's Main St, this is a hidden gem worth seeking out. They have some of the best Irish food I've had in Pittsburgh- the colcannon is awesome and the shepherd's pie is out of this world. If you're not looking for Irish food, then try the grilled cheese- and make sure you ask it with the three cheeses together. It's big and the cheese is thick and gooey. I get it with a side of potato pancakes... Yum. 

Also, they have Guinness, Smithwicks and Harp on tap..."
"PA","I have said it on other sites and will repeat here. You MUST try their burgers. They are juicy and delicious with a bun that is perfect. Another must are the fries with Guinness gravy and if you haven't had enough go for the ultimate sleeper, Leek and potato soup. Authentic black & tans. Harp and Murphys on tap. It don't get no better. This is a true gem my friends."
"PA","Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4"" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. 

We also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The ""steak"" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. 

I have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again!"
"PA","Recommended. 16 inch pizza on special was cheap. Fast service. Not the best pizza but above average."
"PA","3/6/12  visit -  i am from san francisco bay area and if u want a dive go to china town in san francisco. - this place was dirty like chinatown dive but some of the best food i have every tasted came from a dive. the food was really good and my group ordered a bunch of different things it was all good- a- taste.- prices are reasonable a-. --------they dont speak english very good and got my order wrong.
sweet potatoe fries a+
pizza  - a
eggplant hoagie b+
greek salad b+
gyro a+
if they scrubbed the place down and the lady spoke better english 4 star ****"
"PA","The delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell, having confused 133 and 113.

Rather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation, he begins to accuse my wife and I of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza.

The driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed, begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges. 

So I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.

I would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it's residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I'd never order from again anyway.

Do yourself a favor and order from ANY other establishment in town."
"PA","I just needed a broken zipper replaced on my favorite Penguins fleece jacket and a pair of suit pants hemmed.  The price was very reasonable and the work done was great.  I will go back for all my tailoring needs and highly recommend if you need any done."
"PA","This is the best alteration place I have been to. The guy that owns it is extremely helpful and works FAST. Also, the prices are so reasonable I wonder how he stays in business. He was able to do an alteration on short notice and was very acommodating. The alteration I needed done--and fast--was right in the middle of prom season. All the other places I called gave me a several week wait, but he took me right away. I will be back!"
"PA","I needed alterations done to my suit very quickly. Like three days quickly. Not only did Filberto at Alteration World have it ready, the price was beyond reasonable and the work was EXCELLENT! I plan on bringing all my clothes to him from now on.

Oh and he let me know that they also dry-clean. Wonderful shop!"
"PA","New to area and decided to pay this shop a visit! It was definitely the best experience I've ever had with a tailor. He is MUCH cheaper than the other shops, he charges 10 while others charge $15, and he goes above and beyond for what he charges.

I dropped off 4 jeans, and he hemmed and tapered the jeans! I couldn't even tell the difference between the store bought jeans and the quality of his work. It was absolutely perfect, no bulges or puckers! They the match the exact stitch as the factory. 

Absolutely a great guy, they were all done and waiting for me as promised! I'll definitely be taking all of my business to this place, and would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a personal tailor who actually cares about his work and building an honest business."
"PA","Having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important.  I try to keep it as local as possible, so when I heard about a tailor in Carnegie I was intrigued.  The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.  There is a Latino man in his 20's working when you arrive.  In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing.  He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.  He takes his business very seriously.  While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price.  Really nice guy, please go and support this business to keep him around town!"
"PA","It's deep fried garbage....it's LOS c'mon what do you expect.....however I have never had better, friendlier service at a fast food restaurant."
"PA","I agree with Paul on this one. But I had to stop here on my way home from work tonight. 
(I think I feel my heart yelling at me again) , The gal at the drive thru window was just soooo sweet , I just might go back and ask her to marry me! 
But then again , she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online. 
Maybe she just wanted my positive response. Ok Sarah B. you got it ... now where's my free coke ?"
"PA","Are you are really looking at the review for LJS?  Its fried stuff, with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat.  You will regret eating it 30 minutes after you finish, but it is delicious."
"PA","I've been to this office a good amount of times.  Each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable.  Dr. Weinberg herself is very nice, but I doubt her ability. Every procedure she has done to my teeth has backfired. The third and last issue I have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visits and somehow I have received an invoice for $55. I called and of course the receptionist was sassy and rude so I gave up. Will never go back or refer anyone else"
"PA","This is by far the best dentist I have ever been to.  She is honest and never trys to sell you a bunch a stuff that you dont need. We are very great full that we discovered her. We adjust our vacations to make sure that we stop in to her office in Pennsylvania at least once a year for cleaning and check ups, worth the drive from Florida."
"PA","In all fairness - I did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minutes for them to open.

When I look at Yelp reviews, I usually weed out the outliers (the best and the worst).   Unfortunately, there are only two reviews.

It was my first time at the office.   The office admin (very nice) asked for me to come early (before 9am) to complete paperwork.   I arrived at 8:50.    I waited.   I watched 2 employees walk by me (unlocked the door and re-locked it).    They did not acknowledge me.

The door I was at had signage (open hours).    I decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presence.

The office admin (very nice) called me to inform I am missing my appointment.   I explained to her that there were too many indications where this was not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of luck.

I recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door (furthest away from the parking lot) for the entrance.

Poor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review."
"PA","When I moved to the area, Dr. Weinberg was recommended to me by my cousin who had been a client for years. I've had nothing but positive experiences with her and her staff since seeing her two years ago. The team is professional, nice and courteous. I recently had to reschedule an appointment due to a last minute work thing and they were very accommodating. My daughter looks forward to coming to the dentist so that's saying something. I DO wish they would turn off FOX news in the lobby as I'd rather watch paint dry but... nobody's perfect."
"PA","By far the worst most unprofessional dentist I have ever experienced her staff is too busy watching soap operas on all the TVs in each room instead of cleaning and she gave me a filling which was too deep which could have been understandable as her son had his pictures delivered from Hawaii and she had to stop 3 times to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a 14 year old go to Hawaii on her moms dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen I had to have oral surgery and have the tooth removed because she put the filling in too deep an abscessed tooth was the result I wouldn't recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone I hate because of the three months of extreme tooth pain I had to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after I called and asked them for advice and follow up they simply could care less and did not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribing me vicodin and antibiotics do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pulled!!"
"PA","All I can say is the worst! We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch, the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles, a scooter, and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room. A fish tank with filthy, slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.

Our food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. Of course its cold, just like the room, I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.

We asked for water, they brought us 1 in a SOLO cup for 2 people. I asked for hot tea, they said 10 minutes. What Chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon request?

Over all.... my first and last visit to this place. The only good point was that it was cheap, and deservingly so."
"PA","I came here with two friends prior to visiting Apis Meadery next door this past weekend.  I ordered the General Tso's chicken, and my friends ordered the sesame chicken, crab rangoon, and another appetizer (egg rolls?).  They ordered the combo with less meat, and I ordered the one with more--the names were very similar, which I found confusing. The food took quite a while to come up (~15 min.), so I'd suggest calling ahead if you're in a rush.  While we were waiting, the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in Chinese, and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery (probably the same person).

To be honest, I'm not much of a fan of Americanized Chinese cuisine (I lived in Singapore for 3 mos. and have visited Hong King and Japan); it's been awhile since I've had it, and this dish reminded me why.  I don't care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce, nor do I care for the pre-cut meat in the dishes (I like to cut up my own meat, thank you very much), so the flavors and textures don't do much for me.  Having said that, my friends claimed this was the best Americanized Chinese fare they'd had in PGH (and they live in Squirrel Hill!), so if you're a fan of this cuisine, you can take that into consideration.

If nothing else, this meal provided us with some much-needed food to absorb the alcohol from the mead, which I appreciated."
"PA","Delicious Singapore noodles and seafood delight. Crispy flavorful crab Rangoon, and cold sesame noodles done well (but could've used a bit more sauce). Excellent real Chinese food, friendly service.  Restaurant ambience: high school cheap date quality."
"PA","I used to order takeout here once every month or so. The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. 

The last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  

As for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. 

The workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking."
"PA","Far away from real Chinese food. Doesn't even taste good as American style Chinese food."
"PA","Take it from me; avoid this place at all cost.  The only time I go is when I am starved and don't have the energy to cook or get edible food.  And then after I have been kicking myself."
"PA","Don Don is a restaurant I find myself missing now and again, it's probably my favorite restaurant in Carnegie. Simple setup, just a small restaurant with a few tables and a TV. Oddly enough I think my favorite thing to eat there is the wonton soup, never had better. The food is average but I always enjoyed eating there, great service and a cheap place to get Chinese food."
"PA","This location never disappoints!! Food is always consistently great, and if you come at the right time, (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back. And it is awesome! ! Love this place!!"
"PA","Perfect time with hubby, after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal, waitress was such an adorable girl. Her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great job!
Strawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :) 
Strawberry milkshake, nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering!
Its always nice when u go late at night like us, it is not crowded, not noisy, nice music playing and always nice people around. 
If you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say Denny's!"
"PA","I love their stakes and i come here every week just to get the t bone steak, it is completely delicious! 

Great atmosphere, there is always a lot people and the waiters are nice; food portion is great as well!"
"PA","Went for breakfast on 6/16/14. We received very good service and meal came within a few minutes.Waitress could have smiled more but was friendly. 
I had a Grand Slam... it was more than enough food. 
Meal was very tasty... We will definitely go back. 
It is a popular Denny's."
"PA","We went on a weeknight.  Place was not busy waited over 20 minutes for drinks and to have our order taken.  We ordered an app and it came out with the meals and that was another 20 minutes or so.  Food was luke warm at best.  I would not go back."
"PA","If you like being greeted in the morning by a gym worker slopping down eggs from a frying pany instead of working....this is your gym....complain to the manager and she gets nasty....try getting in touch with the owner....impossible!  Most unprofessional gym ever!!!!"
"PA","I really like this gym. It is nice neighborhood gym and unlike big gyms they don't have big contracts and they have flexible memberships. Great selection of classes. All the instructors are very good knowledgable and motivating. All the staff working there are super nice. Their selection of the equipment is good too !!"
"PA","I bought a three month membership last year, mainly to attend the Silver Sneakers classes. I was in my early sixties and hadn't exercised in a while. I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so I tried a morning class for seniors. I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. I didn't feel welcome here. I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident. Do they think that this is their private gym?"
"PA","I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh, and I find that this gym is not too far from me.  The staff is friendly, the equipment is quite good.  You get two free personal training sessions when you join.  They have lots of weights (which my boyfriend uses) and a decent cardio room.  The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment.  Water is only $1 a bottle!"
"PA","Talk about overpriced. $18 for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously frozen chicken chopped up over it. The latter was terrible, thin and flabby and rather unappealing. The pasta itself was ok, as was the sauce. The desserts are pretty good. But honestly, that is a $10 dish whose price has been inflated."
"PA","Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh."
"PA","Man has this place gone down hill.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago.  We had salads and pasta.  Both were on the verge of inedible.  With a single glass of wine, I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  Seriously, I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. Classico is better.  And the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didn't want to deal with it.  Seriously, I'd rather eat at the OG."
"PA","Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.

The bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.

I'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing."
"PA","Some of the best chow around--love this place. The bread and salads and soups are great."
"PA","We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said ""yep"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said ""What do you want me to do""?

My friend said ""An apology would be a good start"" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said ""Get out and don't come back"" ???????? Are you kidding????

My friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. 

That being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.

There are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service."
"PA","It was just what we were looking for. The service was great. My husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. It was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. I had the stuffed eggplant. That was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. I would definitely go back. Really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back."
"PA","spinach/feta cheese salad:  B-
pesto alfredo penne :  :A+
Coconut Cake huge piece:  A+
bread small portions:  B
Service B 
host seemed grumpy, waitress good, but then she got busy .
PRICE: Pasta was $15 and the portion smallish more like a $12.99 dish 
ARRIVE EARLY ON SATURDAY NIGHT THIS PLACE PACKED after 6pm"
"PA","I love this place! The food is always so fresh and delicious. The staff is always friendly, as well."
"PA","Service was great. Apps delish, specifically the stuffed banana peppers & lentil with ham soup. I think I chose the wrong entree though because I ordered a cod with crabmeat special. The cod was completely tasteless with some crabmeat layed across the top. It all reminded me of boiled fish. Yuck! Note to self. Order the pasta!"
"PA","2nd times a charm. This place was 3.5 starts the first time I came, but stepped up large tonight.  Waitress was righteous and very fun.  Food was all excellent.  Caesar salad tasty--got with tomatoes big $ on that, fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor.  Can't wait for the leftovers!!  The white pizza is that star though.  The crust/dough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf.  I don't throw those accolades out easily, especially on pie, but this joint serves it up.  Good vibe, great service, phenomenal food.  Ill be back."
"PA","Delicious!  Everything I've ever had here was great!  The white pizza is a MUST!  Always amazing!  I'm also a big fan of the chicken piccatta.  The bread that they bring to the table is delicious too!  They have a wide variety of selections on the menu and they also have nightly specials that always sound great!  Their prices are also reasonable.  Overall, I highly recommend this place!"
"PA","I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around."
"PA","The menu has lots of choices and the food is great! The Resturante has been expanded so it's pretty large. The new section has door that they leave open during nice weather which makes for a nice ambience! The bread is great and fresh baked daily!"
"PA","Terrible service...terrible food...this place smells like rotten wet wood"
"PA","Service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are ""just"" working . They have nice decor,nice bar and good bread. Consider where this place is ,the prices are really really high . Nothing is served on the side with main dishes ...."
"PA","Had dinner at Papa J's with a group of 6.  I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.

People ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.

We ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.

Hard to tell if the deserts were ""homemade.""  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one. 

On the whole, I was on the fence with my overall impression of Papa J's.  ""A-ok"" probably is the best way to describe it."
"PA","Coming here you get the feeling they haven't changed much.  The tables, the decorations, the menu.  All the same.  Does that make you a little worried?  Yes.

I ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  Very very oily.  The actual ravioli was okay, enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  Did I mention that?  

Ambiance, like I said, left much to be desired.  I don't think I'd have this place on my list of ""musts"" for downtown.  Much better restaurants to visit!"
"PA","san francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great. I am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area. I liked Carnegie because u can stroll down Main street and hit a couple places for lunch. I imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night. we ate a lunchtime and it was nice."
"PA","I thought the interiors were very nice.  We stopped here on a Friday night & I was glad they weren't busy because nothing else in the area looked appetizing.  

My daughter & I split a chicken parm sandwich, which was really good. Instead of it being served on a hoagie, it was served on thin bread- like focaccia or something.  It was pretty good- little messy.

The desserts looked amazing.  I thought it was pretty cool how you can watch the cooks prepare the food from outside.  The kitchen is situated on a corner with lots of windows.

I would return."
"PA","This is a regular go-to for me. I love the food and the service. They always have the wine that I like and the food is always delicious. I suggest trying the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store (in the section where you can buy stuff to take home). It is sublime and makes you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness."
"PA","I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. 

From the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.

But it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.

My biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. 

But before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their ""mistake"" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).

My opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at."
"PA","Great little gem! The food was fantastic was very food and just the right price. The Italian food was amazing, but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepared for giant serving. I had the carrot cake yummy!! Def a place everyone should try."
"PA","OK, its Friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. Driving by Papa J's and W says, lets stop in and get a quick dinner. 

Advice host that we are in a hurry.  The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!

Just as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  In and out in 60 minutes.  Now that is some good service."
"PA","We met our good friends from Morgantown here for lunch today and were really impressed with the place itself and the menu. 

I had read a few of the reviews ahead of time and the pizza was mentioned more than once so by the time we got there, I was jonesing for it. 

It certainly delivered. The crust was great, the sauce wast too sweet and the toppings were sufficient. 

Our friend for the baby clams with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bit - as good as the pizza was, this was _much_ better. 

We'll return again to this beautifully lit gem in Carnegie PA soon!"
"PA","Yay, I'm a fan of the white pizza.  Had take out.  

The bar was jumping when I picked up our order.

The white pizza is so delicious...with garlic, spinach, feta, and added some veggies.  Tried the Roman Style calamari, very good better than the fried calamari we had last time."
"PA","Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.  Waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  Saved his tip by discounting meal after I complained.  All and all, a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests.  Not to be repeated, never again!"
"PA","Yay, I'm a fan but sometimes service is a little slow, it was very good for us this visit.  Go to Papa j's every once in a while but mostly for the White Pizza.  It is the best white pizza I have ever had.  Order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend... it has garlic, spinach, feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top.  It was delicious!  Order fried calamari and it was OK...note to self next time try the calamari roman style.

Like the dinning room with the hardwood floors and bright lighting.  

The bar was jumping thou never go to the bar."
"PA","What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.

First off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.

I am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  

The server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  

We also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  

By the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  

One of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  

They had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.

Overall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.

My only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!"
"PA","I went there for dinner last night with a client.  This is second time I visited.  I had a scotch and he had a Guiness.  The (-1) is for drink selection. Just stock some better beers and higher end scotch and you're five stars.

We started with the meatballs covered with Provolone and other blessed goodness.  These did not disappoint.  I had a four cheese pizza with sweet sausage and garlic.  It was fantastic.  They have so many good dishes, but I wanted the pizza last night.  I couldn't finish the pizza - way to go big medium pizza.

I finished up with a coffee.  The parking can be a bit of a challenge on the street, but it's a small town atmosphere in Carnegie, PA.  I love the downtown there."
"PA","I've been to Papa J's twice and had mixed experiences.

Both times I had the banana pepper appetizer, which is great and goes really well with the FRESH and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.

For entrees, me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience.  I've had the fish sandwich (very good) and the eggplant parm sandwich (okay).  My girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it, but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing. 

The service is also a mixed bag.  The first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even MADE me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich.  The second time, the server was lackluster, didn't know anything about the menu and wasn't able to take proper care of us.  

I would return to Papa J's, but I my terrible experience last time isn't enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around Carnegie/Robinson."
"PA","Great, authentic, classic Italian restaurant in one of the most unlikely places. 

I grew up eating here and make a visit nearly every time I come to town.

Try the fried calamari ""Roman Style"" for a little kick!"
"PA","This place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to Italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food, and couldn't think of any place we wanted to eat. Papa J's measures up to our expectations with great salads, bead and wine. I'm partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers, ravioli, fish, white pizza. I like the space with exposed brick walls-there are knowledgeable servers. Sometimes it is a bit loud- more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby. But don't get the wrong impression -it's a great place-consistantly great food."
"PA","Thanks yelpers for this find. The service, the plating, the ambiance were wonderful. I had the eggplant parmigiana and it was good - but different. It was thinly sliced (like deli meat) and wasn't breaded, it was fried in a very light batter."
"PA","This is one of my husband's fave restaurants in town. My husband generally orders Chicken Parm, which is very good. Their sauce is quite good. They serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping -- yum.

 I generally order one of their house salads (think it has a specific name, but can't recall off the top of my head) which has mixed greens and I get it with blue cheese, pine nuts and their yummy vinaigrette. A tad pricey for a salad that's just lettuce and cheese (I want to say about $8 with the extras), but really good. (Especially with some cracked black peeper.) I tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the greens & beans. 

The place has sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side. It has a comfortable feeling. It also has a solid wine by the glass selection -- better than a lot of places in the 'burgh. 

Unfortunately, we've never had dessert there b/c we get so full of bread and dinner!"
"PA","Papa J's is by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, my hometown.  I eat there almost every time I visit, and everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic.  Fresh ingredients, simple preparation, reasonable prices.  Also, they make the best pizza in town HANDS DOWN."
"PA","I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.

My pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.

Well, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. 

The first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. 

Can I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.

I know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)"
"PA","Absolutely Awful Service.  Went to Papa J's awhile ago and the service was bad - the waiter was surly, rude and unhelpful..  Decided to try it again since it is close to Stage 62.  Big mistake.  Greeted by a dour manager that seemed mad that we had a reservation. 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.  At one hour and 45 minutes complained to the manager that we still had not received out entrees.  He said 'What do you want me to do about it?"" and said they had a busy night.  This is when tables around us sat empty. I then had to go back to the manager to give us our bill so we could get away from this ruined evening.  The bill was prepared incorrectly. If you want average food and terrible service, this is your place.  We will never go back."
"PA","I am amazed that people can write negative reviews about Papa J's.   I have been a return customer since the early 90's and the food quality, and service, are way above average......and especially for this price range.

Kudos to management for maintaining such a level of quality and freshness.   Nothing we had tonight was disappointing, and we over-ordered because each dish was delectable.

The best item tonight was the Mozzarella appetizer ""cradled"" in Bread with an authentic marinara.

The white pizza with sun-dried tomatoes was, as usual, out of this world good.   The scallops special appetizer was phenomenal.

WE WILL BE BACK."
"PA","Just to start off, we were a party of 12, which is always a little difficult.  We were celebrating 2 birthdays.

We LOVED the food, it was delicious. My husband got a chicken parm sandwich, which is served on a yummy flat bread, and I got the chicken basil pizza ( i got an 8 cut and several ppl tried it) we all LOVED it! It was stunning.  It was made with a very delicious crust, nice and crisp, not soggy (like pesto pizza can get)

The one waitress we had JASMINE, was fantastic!  She was bright, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  She took extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections... 

Now... the other waitress.. Mary something was so incompetent...  She was awful and rude.  She missed 2 people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said 'well they didn't speak up!' Ugh.  Then when it was time to sing and cut the cake, my sister in law said 'oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing?'  She came back, cut the cake (all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake) and we didn't even sing!  We were mad!!

The place is so pretty, they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years (according to my father in law) and its really nice.  They look to have a cool bar area with some modern couches and a really sweet look.   

So good food, great looking place.. one bad waitress. Prices are about middle of the road for an authentic Italian place, nothing crazy.  All in all, we'd like to go back again, but we want Jasmine!"
"PA","I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.  

I was greeted by a large open (garage style) window, that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  It had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.

Ordered the quattro formaggi pizza.  Quite good!!!  Great balance of cheeses.  Not too rich at all.  Crust was excellent too.  Can't wait to come back."
"PA","Very good restaurant with very good food at a pretty reasonable price.  We had a birthday dinner here with seven girlfriends. The waitress was very efficient , but not very friendly. Our orders came out hot and excellently prepared!  Try the tilapia milanese , it's excellent. Best steamed broccoli Iv'e ever had."
"PA","Papa J's is expensive and inconsistent.  The ambiance is nice but it doesn't justify the prices.  There are better restaurants in Carnegie."
"PA","Although the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant- much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience. Our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room, right by a door where clinking pots /pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal, as well as a Darth Vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent. Our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered. ( dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) The waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. Also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or Gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price (6.99) which brought the salad up to 10.99 ! Outrageous !
There is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant , but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere. I will most likely not return. Very overpriced for the quality and service."
"PA","Great place for dinner, drinks or a small celebration.

Papa J's is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we don't have reservations and want a nice dinner out. My husband and I have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy. I have been proved wrong.  We are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes. Unfortunately, the alternate bar/lounge area isn't always open. I really don't understand why more people don't go here. 
My favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.The zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. The wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. My husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. Also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. Make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table. 

Also, if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event, consider Papa Js. They have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties. We had our rehersal dinner for our wedding here and everyone loved the food."
"PA","The worst dental office I ever been. No one can beat it!!! You should avoid it at any time."
"PA","THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The ""dentist"" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with ""you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth"". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this ""bone graft"". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The ""dentist"" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers."
"PA","I've decided where I stand with Emmert Dental. They are unprofessional, rude and have no clue what they're doing (behind the desk). I will not be going back nor will I have nice things to say about them."
"PA","I'm up in the air about how I feel regarding Emmert Dental. Being that it is located in Market Square can be both a good or bad thing. Parking is scarce not to mention you have to pay for it yet you have great restaurants and coffee places around you. The office itself is old and raggedy looking but the staff are young and hip. I think possibly a little too young and hip. My dentist knew what she was doing but I didn't adore her. I'm still working out my bill because they charged me too much on my copay and don't really seem to have all their info. together. After a cleaning and fillings, I think I'm going to look for somewhere else to get my future dental work done..."
"PA","This McDonald's is so bad it's amazing.  

Order:  Big mac, large fries, diet coke.

The soda machine was broken.   No sodas.

Then I got to the window.  ""We rang you up for medium fries.""   (Not what I asked for)  ""Well, if you want a large, you're gonna have to wait 4 minutes.  We just started a new batch.""

Left with:  Big mac, medium fries, no coke.

Actually, now that I think about it, this was one of my better experiences there..."
"PA","I've tried to give this McDonalds a chance but my patience has run out. The only reason why I came here as much as I did is because I like the $1 iced coffees. But it's not even worth it. This McDonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. 

Whenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. So most of the time I just park and go inside the restaurant. 

Today was a horrible day. I ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,""Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you!"" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  I refused because I had just had enough.

There are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on!

I'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore. Guess I'll be going to Starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway!"
"PA","My expectations for McDonalds are t rarely high. But for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!
The cashier took my friends's order, then promptly ignored me. I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid's meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for ""serving off their orders"" when they didn't have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.
The manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn't make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.
I've eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I've worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead!"
"PA","Eat at your own risk. The service is terrible, the staff seem to be generally clueless, the management is inclined to blame the staff for their own mistakes, and there's no sense of FAST in their fast food. When we came, half of the menu board was still on breakfast, and it was 4:30p. The only thing they have going for them is that the food is hot and tastes just like McDonald's should. 

Then again, the franchise is owned by Rice, and I've come to take terrible service is their MO."
"PA","Some how even though the food at this Eat'n Park is down right abominable, the smiles and laughter is always there.  How can I stay mad when the prices or so cheep? Myself my boyfriend and his nephew had lunch with milkshakes and me having a coffee it was $31.00

On this particular occasion the fire alarm went off and rang and rang and rang loud and long for over 15 minutes before the fire department got there realized they didn't have key to turn it off and than another 10 minutes later finally shut it off...only at Eatn' Park.

My baked potato was hard as a rock, I had ordered two pieces of baked cod and only received one. 

The waitress was very sweet and attentive and really attempted to build a rapport with our lil nephew which I thought was sweet."
"PA","They burned my fish and they burned it bad.  Ordering fish at Eat'n Park is always a gamble.  I just never know how it's going to turn out.  I'm a risk taker so I ordered two pieces of baked lemon sole. 

Well it went terribly wrong.  My waiter came out and said, ""They burned your fish, so I had them put two new pieces in the oven.""  I was impressed by his honesty and didn't mind waiting for two new pieces.  

 I gladly helped myself to my boyfriend's french toast while I waited. 

Then out of no where another server comes to the table with the burnt fish and sets it down infront of me. With the burnt side down of course.  That just shows the kitchen is not in total coordination.  

Like I said getting fish from Eatn' Park is a toss up. In the end I got two nicely baked pieces of sole to replace the burnt ones, so I left satisfied."
"PA","This company represents a honest and caring company that cares about their community.  They operate a variety of businesses and restaurants including the Eat n Park locations, the new Porch in Shenley, Six and Penn Kitchen, and the new upcoming Hello Bistro.  I cannot wait to try all of their dinning places."
"PA","We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. 

One of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! 

Spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. 

When I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - ""Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll."" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!

Not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. 

I am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening!"
"PA","I am always so pleased with the customer service here. For such a tiny Starbucks, the do a really great job serving the masses that come in there and still manage to take the time to be friendly in the midst of the frenzy. 

Outdoor seating in the summer is nice."
"PA","This Starbucks is 5-Star Friendly. The shift supervisor Lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light. He recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience, kindness, generosity and fairness. I left that afternoon loving Starbucks even more than when I went in. It's great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them."
"PA","I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the small, alley-like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or tables when it's busy. And there's hardly any tables to sit at. Furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult (especially in the winter weather). The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there. And the coffee that I had was cold- I'm sure it was probably the bottom of the batch. I'd probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area."
"PA","As far as Starbucks go, this is a pretty nice one.  The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.

I do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.

There was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.

Overall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency."
"PA","This Starbucks is teeny-tiny!

Seating inside is VERY limited.  This is a Starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the Waterfront.

Baristas are friendly and fast."
"PA","I love the location of this Starbucks, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. It's right smack in the middle of clothing stores, the Loews movie theater, as well as restaurants. I love grabbing a mid afternoon latte here on a Saturday while perusing various stores such as the Gap or Loft. I also like coming here before or after a movie for a quick caffeine jolt.

While the drinks are the same as you would find at any Starbucks, the baristas and staff are really friendly, perhaps more so than other area Starbucks. 

My drink or choice when I come here generally in the mod afternoon is a venti (or trenta...) berry hibiscus refresher. Yum! It is the perfect afternoon pick-me-up that leaves me feeling refreshed and hydrated."
"PA","Regarding quality of beverage, this is just your average Starbucks. I can't complain but am not blown away either. However, I really like the location of this shop, which is located in the center of The Waterfront's specialty retail shops. Though in the midst of a lot of retail, the surrounding area is very picturesque with pretty green grass, flowers, and a fountain. Hanging out here is very relaxing."
"PA","Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff."
"PA","I just realized they remodeled this one recently-ish. Well, in my world recently because it's been a while since I've been here.

They've added more seating which makes it way more conducive to having a meeting here. Which is my concern during the week. I imagine during the weekend it just fills up with tweens getting their sugar rush before hitting the movie theater. 

The coffee, or tea for me.. Is still same old same old. I don't imagine one single Starbucks will break the mold and make original drinks..."
"PA","I have to agree with Joe on this one.  The baristas are extremely friendly, and the service is great, but the fact that there are no comfy chairs or couches is very unwelcoming.  I do think however that the building is beautifully ans strategically located in the center of the shopping.  I just wish they had better seating."
"PA","This is a typical Starbucks. The coffee is good but the store is suprisingly dirty."
"PA","If there was ever a ""get your coffee and go"" Starbucks, this is it. Right in the center of the Waterfront, this Starbucks has no sofa, comfy chairs, only table seating. I love the baristas here, But I don't like the location of the building."
"PA","Typical Starbucks coffee chain. 2 things I dont like about this Starbucks: 

1. Ive been there twice and both times the place has been dirty, compared to the other Starbucks I have been in.

2. If you have to use the bathroom, they give you a key thats attached to this nasty bottle. Im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly.

Aside from that, good coffee and fast/friendly service."
"PA","Mmm...peppermint mocha

In my quest to visit every Starbucks in the USA I have stopped at yet another location.  This one is located in the center of a circle road -- very cache and in a newer part of the area."
"PA","Friendly staff, same starbucks fair you get anywhere else.  Sometimes the lines can get long."
"PA","This is a tiny Starbucks and it locations like this (although cute) makes you wonder if your really meant to hang out or just grab your coffee and leave. Leaving is always a good idea at this location anyway since you have a nice fountain in the back with benches and it is a central part of the Waterfront Shopping. 

Starbuck isn't my favorite coffee chain by any means. Is it just me or do all Starbuck coffees taste a little burnt and bitter? No matter how trendy, cool and upscale their establishments are I can't get around the yicky tasting bitterness of Staryucks regular coffees. Talk about over roasting a bean...Maybe something has changed with their regular coffee but I have not drank it in about a year. I am not one for soy caramel latte foofy stuff. Still I'll give the establishment tres estrellas for the fact that their espresso is acceptable and doesn't taste half as bad as the regular coffee bean."
"PA","You would think their exorbitant prices would at least buy some decent customer service. Not at this location. 

They are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything. This is a problem because they carry so many completely different products that it's hard to find what you need. Expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistance.

The organization is disjointed, especially depending on your project. There's even a section called ""art supplies"". I thought that was kind of the point of the whole store. 

What did it in however was how miserably they packed my picture frames. The place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glasses in paper to protect them, but apparently Michael's thinks a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather. 

So, the inevitable happened and I dropped the bag. Now I don't expect every place to be sympathetic, even though it could have been packed better, but when I asked for a refund they were down right RUDE. Hey I did drop the thing, but some empathy would have been nice. I wasn't completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place. I will never be back to this or any other Michael's."
"PA","The one good thing I can say about Michael's is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. They've got items for woodwork, painting, knitting, kids crafts, scrapbooks, you name it. The problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal. They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck. It's not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. It's that when you find the right section, there's either nothing in stock, or they simply don't even carry what you need. 

I stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. 

Plus the prices at Michael's are significantly more than other area craft stores. I usually only stop there if I'm already at tend Waterfront. I'd recommend checking other craft stores first. Unless you need glitter. Especially fine glitter. Michael's has the best glitter selection/quality of any store I've ever been to."
"PA","I come here pretty frequently for art and craft supplies. Whatever Michaels doesn't have I just order online from a different retailer. Some items are pricey but you can still find some good deals. If you go all the way to the back of the store you can find interesting clearance items. Customer service is average. My favorite time to visit Michaels is when summer is about to end and all the fall and Halloween items are set out. Since I come here often, I know where everything I need is. However, the store could use a new layout."
"PA","It's yet another Michael's, and it's a very good one. Recommended always. For those who love crafting, Michael's is a godsend."
"PA","It's your typical chain craft store.  And let me reiterate that I'm not a crafts person. I walked in because I needed dial rods for some signs I had. Now for being a chain store I was a bit upset because even though they had a decent selection, the amounts they had for each one I wanted were scarce.  Imagine me standing there with different sizes of wood in my hand and just staring in disbelief.  And for a piece of wood, the price was a bit steep.

I will provably come back here, but only for an item that I cannot find elsewhere. Or if I'm too lazy to drive further out."
"PA","I have been frequently shopping at this Michaels store over the last couple months since I began taking a cake decorating class and hosted a large baby shower at my home. The store has typically had the supplies that I need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies. This location is pretty average compared to other Michaels - it's exactly what you would expect when going to this store. It's not a large store, but it's not a small store -- just average.

I do enjoy using the Michael's coupons when shopping. I definitely save a lot of money! Instead of toting around the paper versions, I actually have the iPhone app that has coupons available to use from the app. 

My only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to check out at this location. I don't normally have a problem - usually only one or two people ahead of me - but sometimes it can be much slower. Today, for example, there were only two customers ahead of me, but one of them was having issues with a coupon. The line began to get longer and longer, and though a couple associates were lingering up front, they kept calling for someone else. From personal experience of being a manger in a retail store, do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register. Whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customers, it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient...."
"PA","For someone who straddles the line between sometimes craft-er, this store can seem vast and confusing.  There's rows and rows of baskets and bedazzling jewels and paper and...oh my...scrap booking!  When I want to find boring old felt....it's like...where do I start?  

I'm in a hurry, as always, and I rush in and the first thing I look for is an employee.  No one to be found.  I could call out and my voice would come echoing back.  I run between rows of paper, wood and gosh darn scrap booking....no felt!  Where do I find felt!  Where do I find an employee!?

FINALLY, I find one after 15 minutes of wondering around.  She's incredibly nice and leads me to the felt.  This is not the first time I've been hard up to find help.  I tell her she was hard to find, and she tells me that they're ""low on payroll"" and can't have any one the floor BUT HER!  In that WHOLE store, JUST HER!  That's ridic!

Not a month ago I was, again, in a slight hurry and stood in line for about 15 minutes to check out, with 2 employees at the register and 6 people per line, I gave up and walked out.  

Hey Michael, do you pick up what I'm putting down?  You're not making any money because your costumer service SUCKS....in fact, there's no service to be found!"
"PA","Food is good, what you'd expect from Steak n Shake. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. so incredibly awful. expect to take at least an hour for your meal, even when it's slow. I've been going here for years when I want a cheap meal, but the service is so so so awful. Go to McDonalds."
"PA","The food is good. Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints."
"PA","Fast food in a resturant setting.  Considering this food is good and cheap plus you can get food to go.  Must be a reason why this place is always packed."
"PA","Fast food done right, what more can you want?

A throwback to old timey diners, steak and shake is where you get a decent meal at a good price. 

My sisters and I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon around 3pm catching their 2-4 happy hour, which we read on the door upon entry; a lovely surprise. This meant that all shakes and drinks were 50% off! 

I ordered the western BBQ burger, which was 2 thin patties, cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce, and fried onions. It came with shoe string fries (my favorite), all for the low price of $4.79. Are you kidding me? What's not to like! The food was actually pretty good! I liked it a lot. Since it was happy hour I also ""splurged"" on a chocolate covered strawberry shake. It was meh. Could have gone without it. The overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off, but the hot fudge saved it. But, how can you really go wrong with hot fudge?

All in all, 3 meals and 3 shakes came to $20. A steal. Also the food is good! I enjoyed it. I'd come back."
"PA","I really like the chili. Burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad. Pretty hard to mess up a side salad. As others have said you never know what kind of service you will get. Store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair. The staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude. All in all what you pay is what you get. Cheap and crap service."
"PA","This place is s l o w....like so slow I have got up and left after waiting 30 minutes and not even being acknowledged by a server. The food is okay. Def not worth the wait. Milkshakes are just okay as well. Booooooo."
"PA","Terrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us. Before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time,  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other. I think one server was high. 
  
  Going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness, so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging."
"PA","The only thing worse than the food is the service."
"PA","Ah, Steak n Shake, you hit the spot after a night of drinking. Open 24 hours, drive thru or dine in, with wonderful, cheap greasy burgers, chicken fingers, breakfast sandwiches, and shoestring fries. You're faster (and cheaper!) than Eat N Park. Plus your employees wear those adorable bow ties. Granted, if we were at a fancy party, I might act like I don't know you, but deep down inside you know I heart you."
"PA","Rather typical SnS.  Had a good lunch crowd.  Milkshake was good but not as good as EnP down the street.  It took to long to get the burger for some reason, 25 minutes, I realized cooked to order but this is a little long for SnS.  Ordered the Guacamole Steakburger and it only had a small portion of Gauc...not your usual amount..kitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason.  Definitely did not look like the picture on the website.  Oh well!"
"PA","In general I do like Shake N' Steak, but this location is a hit or miss location!  You never know what kind of quality or service you're going to find here.  A friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there EVER!  You can't entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire place...poor scheduling on the manager's part. However, while she can't be accountable for the slooooow service, she was accountable for both orders being incorrect.  The burgers were over cooked and the fries were soggie and the milkshake was runny at best...

By far my worst visit to Steak n' Shake!"
"PA","Well... as Steak 'n Shake locations go, this isn't the best one around--but it is burgers and fries that are open 24-7.

The milkshakes are good!

PROS: 
Always made fresh, when you order;

CONS:
Greasy (but its burgers);
Takes longer than typical in drive thru (but that's bc they're made fresh!);
Service (on a scale of 1-10, 10 being awesome) is a 4."
"PA","I heart Steak N Shake. I love the fact that the fries are shoestring, the burgers get to you pretty fast, they're a little greasy, and the food is super cheap.

I visited Steak and Shake on New Year's Eve in preparation for an evening of mostly tame partying. I was unnaturally attracted to their Wisconsin Buttery Burger, which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onions between two buns that have been buttered. Sounds good right?

Well, I get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns had been dunked in butter. The pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me.  I took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burger/fries seasoning on the buns and I literally got tears in my eyes....most likely from the salt overload, but possibly because this was one of the most evilly decadent things I had eaten in a long time.

This is not meant to be a fine dining experience. Service wasn't fast but it wasn't slow. It just kind of was. However, the waitress did get a point for explaining that the order would take X amount of time to all patrons. So I give them a pass for being upfront about it.

Next trip to Pgh is going to feature Steak and Shake - I guarantee it."
"PA","I went here at 3 PM between the lunch rush and the dinner rush, and the restaurant was maybe 20% full. I ordered the Chili Mac Supreme to go. I thought I would be in and out within 5-10 minutes. Keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drive-thru; the expectation is quick service.

Long story short, my food never came... the waitress told me (after I had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet, so I told her to cancel it and walked out. Now I see that others on Yelp have warned about the slow service at this location. Wish I had looked it up earlier."
"PA","This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to. 

The bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.

If not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.

I think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...



PS. The whole joint smells like major B.O."
"PA","Its clean, open 24/7 with hot shoe string fries and creative milkshakes. What else do you want in life??"
"PA","The food is good and its CHEAP.

I mean REALLY INEXPENSIVE.

$4.00 for a burger and fries. Add a coke and its like $10.00-$13.00 for two people.  Seldom if ever crowded. 

Service can be a tad slow but hit or miss.

They also do breakfast and its a great alternative to waiting at eat and park.

Try the shakes, they're great."
"PA","Whenever I was at the waterfront I would eat here.  The shakes are good, as are the shoestring fries and baked beans.  The sandwiches are small thin patties of meat so you probably want at least a double.  Overall, pretty tasty."
"PA","I have gotten several cakes and cupcakes here on different occasions and have always been pleased. The bakery is small but clean and staff has always been helpful and friendly. I would say prices are average. They offer a variety of desserts including numerous different cakes, pies, cupcakes and much more. I have never tried anything other than cakes/cupcakes. The carrot cake is particularly good. This is one of my favorite local bakeries!"
"PA","Signature Desserts is the ONLY bakery I will go to. Not only are they reasonable priced, their desserts are out of this world and their work is fantastic.

I used them for my wedding cake and dessert table. Let me tell you, beyond impressed. I ordered a three tiered cake with an intricate design, 5 addtional 8 inch cakes for the dessert table, and 8 dozen cookies. All of this, including delivery and multiple consultations was under $500!!!!! I was so happy with my dessert table, everything turned out absolutely beautiful, like out of a wedding catalog!!!

Linda and her husband are such wonderful, warm people and they made this experience so wonderful and stress free for me!!! 

I would reccomend them for every bakery need you have!!!!"
"PA","Our wedding cake and dessert table vendor was included in our reception package so I'm sure the owners are going to say we didn't pay them directly so what I write doesn't matter (I've seen this response in other negative reviews).  In my opinion, that should not matter.  We should still receive the same type of respect, courtesy and professionalism that all clients *should* receive.  This was not the case.  I won't rewrite what I posted last year about our issues with the dessert table and the attitude of Linda, but what I am posting about now is our 1 year anniversary cake top.  We were given a certificate in our package for a free, fresh cake made in our *wedding cake flavors.*  Linda even wrote the flavors on the card.  I was really excited to taste the cake since my husband and I didn't really get a chance to during our reception.  They gave us a plain chocolate cake with white icing.  This is not what our wedding cake was.  When I called and asked if there was a mistake I was told someone would call me back.  Of course, they didn't.  So, I called again and spoke with Steve who LAUGHED at me when I asked why we didn't receive a cake in our wedding flavors and then had the audacity to say 'well, you got a free cake.'  Really?!  It wasn't good and it was a plain cake I could have made myself.  When I said 'that's not the point' he said 'what do you want me to do?!  Another cake, fine.  When do you want to pick it up?'  When we picked up the second cake, again, in was the SAME cake as before.  I have yet to try my own wedding cake flavor.  They are so rude, cocky and ignorant.  I will *never* go to the bakery again nor will I ever recommend it to anyone else."
"PA","The staff is always very friendly and helpful every time I call/pop in  I just ordered a very last minute cake for my daughter's birthday and they had it ready to go and it was perfect and tasted wonderful.  I used to have the entire Wilton cake decorating set and would spend hours making frosting and royal icing and decorating every cake myself.  There was a bit of cursing, and complaining and grumping to my poor husband and occasionally I'd ""nail it!"" but now that we have Signature Desserts NO MORE!  These cakes are worth every penny.  So there, pinterest!"
"PA","Wonderful selection of treats and great friendly staff. They catered the deserts and cake for my wedding and everything went terrific from selecting deserts and cake style with my wife (i sure had no clue!)  to the delivery to the venue on our day . . . and the fun part - eating all their delicious deserts. Just loved those cupcakes and so did all our guests! thanks"
"PA","Made our first purchase and will be visiting many more times.  We purchased the fruit tart and the carmel, apple walnut cake.  The tart was great and we cant wait to try the cake on Thanksgiving."
"PA","Signature Desserts is my favorite local bakery. The prices are reasonable and the desserts are always delicious. We purchased the wedding cake package for our wedding. The wedding cake was amazing. We had a 3 layer white cake with chocolate fudge between one layer and fresh strawberries with banana cream between the other layer. In addition to the wedding cake, the package includes cookies, 5 extra specialty cakes and chocolate covered strawberries. All of which are delicious.The only negative criticism I have is that the cake design did not turn out as glamorous and classy as I had pictured it in my head. However, I developed the design. If I would have went with one of the designs that they suggested, I'm confident that it would have looked better. The package also includes a mini ou wedding cake topper for your one year anniversary. Therefore, there is no need to freeze your cake topper and eat dried out cake for your anniversay. I loved our wedding cake so much, I'm having my husband order one for the birth of our first child, due in two weeks.  

In addition to a great deal for your wedding, Signature Desserts has awesome speciality cakes for birthdays, dinner parties or any excuse I can come up with! My favorite is th death by chocolate and the apple/carmel walnut which I believe is only available in the fall.  In addition, their chocolate covered strawberries are always fresh and available most times of the year."
"PA","I got my son's first birthday cake here and it was delicious. Better still, they made him a ""smash cake""-- a mini version we could let him go to town on. I thought that was just fantastic."
"PA","I'll start off by saying our cake and other desserts were delicious and our guests loved them.  We received many compliments.  We also got a lot for our money.  However, customer service and organization was lacking.  I never received a copy of our contract.  In the chaos of the last 3 weeks of wedding planning, I forgot to call them to check on my final payment.  I got a rude call from Linda on a Saturday evening (5 or 6 pm) letting me know I was late and she wouldn't accept a check since it wouldn't clear before the wedding.  Excuse me?  Not clear?  I took as an insult and an accusation as possibly writing a bad check.  Also, we ordered a cake topper, paid for it, but it didn't make it to the reception."
"PA","Had dinner here the other night and it was lovely. The dragon phoenix soup was amazing, the service was wonderful, we'll definitely be going back."
"PA","Best Crab Rangoon! Haven't had a bad meal from there yet. Fast delivery."
"PA","Meh. This is not my kind of place. The food always seems oily or greasy and doesn't taste that good. Plus they have yellow fried rice. That is a big NO NO for me. It is kind of like mushed cardboard. I don't like it at all. I haven't eaten here in a while and i don't think i will start anytime soon."
"PA","I have been going to this place for as long as I can remember. Its a family-run type of place. I remember when one of the owners was newly married - then pregnant - then her son was running around the restaurant - and then he was server - then he did deliveries....  Its kind of nice to see a family business like this. Its not too common anymore!

The food is actually really good!! I love Chinese food and always try to go get chinese food from unique places and this place is on par with some of the best I've had in San Francisco and Chicago's China Town areas. 

The shrimp in lobster sauce is amazing. :) 

They have a private parking lot and are very easy to find, its an old converted brick house right on 88. Enjoy!"
"PA","This has been our go to place for Chinese food, mostly because we support family run businesses, and because it's good. The whole family is friendly, and welcoming, and their various dishes have been hits. My favorites have been their Szechuan spicy tofu, Beef Broccoli, and their beef fried rice. They have one of the better tasting Hot and Sour soups in the area, and their steamed dumplings are tasty, filled with a ground pork mixture, and if it's not pork, it's still tasty!

Most of our orders are take out, but they do offer free delivery. Getting into and out of the parking lot can be tricky, but it's worth it."
"PA","A great hole in the wall restaurant. I've been coming here with my friends for years since high school. The food is delicious and fairly priced. The owners are very friendly and welcoming. I have no idea what the previous reviewer is talking about because there is no buffet at Silver Palace."
"PA","Calabria's looks like a really beautiful restaurant from the outside. The landscaping is always kept up with and the building is attracting to most of us who drive by it often. Although, when you go inside, it is outdated and stuck in the 90s. I went to a bridal shower here, which was elegant and beautiful compared to the regular restaurant area. The party room served breakfast foods later on in the day, which seemed odd to me for a fancy party room. I would recommend this place for a party because it is separate from the restaurant itself, but I am not impressed with the restaurant as a whole. The service was good, the food is alright but the ambiance is just not there."
"PA","Probably 3.5 stars.

Food allergy friendly with a lot of choices. Prices are fair with large portions.

The greek vinaigrette with feta was really good. The food was fine for a casual meal--no complaints. Our waitress was pleasant, attentive, and really went out of her way to work with the gluten allergy at the table.

Nothing special, but still a more than acceptable place for dinner."
"PA","Sad little place, even by Pittsburgh standards. Ambience of a funeral parlor, with average age of patrons about 69. Exemplary Calabria's dish? Oriental chicken salad garnished with uncooked ramen noodles."
"PA","Saying Calabria's is up there with Franco's and Mia Madre is a stretch. However, Calabria's is vey good for what it is- casual italian foods. I would say it's closer to Armstrong's or Little Oasis. I stopped here for dinner with a friend at 8pm on a Saturday night. We asked to sit outside but were informed that the patio was ""rented"" out for the night for a party. When I walked into the dining room, I was immediately frightened and seriously considered going elsewhere. It looked like they clean with pepto bismal. Everything is a very ugly pink color. Tables, booths, chairs, decorations- pepto bismal pink. We were also the youngest patrons by about 20 years. Stomaches growling, we decided to stay and were very glad we did.
I ordered the grilled chicken with a side of pasta with vodka sauce. The entrees also came with a salad or soup. I chose the salad with cheesy garlic dressing. Yes, the dressing is called cheesy garlic. It was a creamy, cheesy italian dressing. Delicious. I can definitely see using this dressing as a sauce for subs and chicken. The salads were also served with italian bread with a oil, balsamic and spices dip. Perfect compliment to my meal. Our entrees arrived quickly. I was very pleased with my choice. The chicken was juicy and tender with good flavors. The penne with vodka sauce was delicious. A wonderful combination of tomatoes and cream. When I asked for parmesan cheese, I was directed to the bottle of shaker cheese on the table. Not quite what I was looking for. Our waitress quickly brought me a small cup of grated cheese. Throughout the night the service was exceptional. Now, that might have to do with the fact that there were only 2 other tables at that time but regardless, it was great. I decided to save a piece of chicken for lunch the next day and get dessert. We were looking for chocolate cake but the closest thing we found was a chocolate brownie ala mode. Other than the decor, dessert was the reason Calabria's got 4 stars instead of 5. The brownie was on the hard and thin side. Overall, I would definitely head back to Calabria's for dinner but will pass on dessert."
"PA","Horrible experience. The food itself was good but way over priced for what it was.  They charged us for every little thing.. extra sides of dressing after they brought the wrong kind to begin with, a side of vinegar, surprised they didn't charge us for the extra napkins. Service was terrible to boot. Never will go back. You'd have better service and food at Olive Garden...and that's hard for me to say."
"PA","My family and I stopped here tonight. We live very close and have yet to ever go. What a mistake. When you first walk in, you are assaulted with pastel palette and an over abundance of mauve. This is more 80's than my grandmothers house. I could ignore the decor if the service was better. It was horrible. Our waitress came twice then disappeared.  Apparently she went home sick and no one else came to pick up our table for over 20 min. Smooth. So when we finally got our food, I was really hoping for greatness. I don't know why I was expecting good food when everything else wasn't.  I ordered veal with peppers.  17.99. I got less than a third of a pepper on my plate with 3 tiny, extremely thin, tough pieces of veal. It was supposed to be served with a brandy sherry sauce. Nope. It was a white wine butter sauce. The description also didn't mention the veal was scallopine. It was. Probably could of given myself a paper cut with these. The experience was awful, the service was horrendous, the decor cannot be unseen, and everything was a good 5 to 7 dollars over priced. Will never go back to this place again."
"PA","If you like waterlogged pasta, runny sauce and food that really is not that good, by all means eat here.  

Water is cold, so that's a plus."
"PA","It's Calabria's - what more can you say. Great good, reasonable prices, and a nice, relaxing atmosphere.

This location and the Upper St. Clair location are both winners. Everything is homemade. The restaurants are super clean, the menu has a nice variety, and the staff is always friendly and helpful."
"PA","What a nice surprise.  We stopped at Calabria's after an early wedding and dined on the patio.  I had the veal and peppers as main course and it was outstanding.  We had the following apps and all were delicious: greens & beans, stuffed bread sticks, fried zucchini, sautéed sausage all of them tasted like more.  

I highly recommend Calabria's it's right up there with Franco's and Mia Madre's as great Italian restaurants."
"PA","Ryan and Brain were great over at Nissan"
"PA","Very unhappy with the sales people did not do what they said they would do service department is very good"
"PA","I am rating Hyundai only.

Do you do your due diligence on cars? Do you dislike pushy salespeople? Do you know as much about the vehicle you're going to buy as the salesperson?  Then you should like this dealer.  They are relatively no-nonsense.
I worked with Ed Doyle a couple times in the past to buy my wife's car, to buy my truck, and to buy another car for my brother in law.
Even though he couldn't get us the deal we wanted on the car for my brother in law, he never tried to take advantage of us. He steered us in a good direction, so to speak.

They are straightforward, they are all business, and won't act condescending or patronizing.  I would highly recommend them as a dealer in the area."
"PA","Best Italian hoagie anywhere in the known universe. I have been eating these sandwiches for the better part of my life (I'm 45) and I still can't wait for the next one. It's the way they are toasted and the cheese caramelizes--and the dressing is just perfect. Honest to god, I live in CO and this is always one of the reasons I return to visit the town I grew up in. Just get an Italian hoagie here and quit trying to --you can forget the meatball sub guy. Pizza is quite good, too. But get the hoagie."
"PA","Some of the best pizza I've had since moving to Pittsburgh. And they have good hoagies as well."
"PA","Best Italian hoagies you can get"
"PA","I'm from eastern PA and NJ...I wanted a simple Meatball Parmigiana sub. for dinner. Apparently Danny doesn't understand what this is or..doesn't know how to make one. I was told they have a meatball sub or a chicken parmigiana sub...but not a meatball parmigiana sub.  Are you kidding me?  How hard is it to split a sub roll down the middle, add 6-8 meatballs (depends on size), red sauce/gravy cover with mozzarella cheese and throw in the oven till the cheese is melted...Danny if you read this you owe me for this recipe!!  Give me a break. I left without my sub and got one from Italian Village Pizza just down the street. Dude this is not rocket science..."
"PA","I went to  Danny's on a recommendation from a friend whose opinion I  highly value,  especially when it comes to food.  When we arrived,  we were warmly greeted by Jorge and Francesco, who would be making our food that evening.   Since I had been told that this place serves the most delicious Italian hoagie ever made, we got one Italian hoagie to split. We waited a very reasonable ten minutes and it was ready.  The portion was good,  it was enough to fill us both up.  It came with just the right amount of veggies (I got extra tomatoes on my half),  and the perfect amount of dressing. Enough to add moisture and flavor,  not so much it was dripping everywhere.  There was no sogginess  in the bun at all. It was toasted a nice light brown color,  not that nasty halfway toasting that gives no color and makes the bread crusty like it sat out all day. The great service and a variety of Italian meats (warm and juicy but not too hot) made this one if the best hoagies I ever had.  Definitely go there!"
"PA","My car must be trained.  Was driving by and for some reason ended up in Danny's parking lot.  These are the same unbelievably delicious Italian hoagies that you get at Danny's Parkview.  The smell in the parking lot started my salivating mouth.  Great big hoagie that has such flavor in every bite.  For some reason even the onions taste better with all the other flavors."
"PA","Being new to the area, I get recommendations from a couple of guys I work with who were born and raised in Baldwin, on the best places to eat, shop, etc.  

I was informed yesterday that Danny's has the best Italian hoagies around.  So I HAD to try one for dinner.  It has the perfect amount of meat seasoning and topping.  The onions were a little heavy for me, but being my first time, I took it as it came.  The bread is perfectly toasted on the outside, and soft on the inside.  In all, I was given good information by my coworkers.  I would rank it in my top 3 of Italian hoagies.  Darren W's. review on the pizza sounds great too.....looking forward to trying it."
"PA","I've been to this bowling alley twice for family events and each time I have been pleasantly surprised with how nice it is. The facility has 44 bowling lanes and a bar with plenty of seating and a pool table. The atmosphere is updated and very clean. I felt they had done a nice job with helping my group to hold an event here as well. The food is a little bit above average for what you expect for bowling alley food and the full service bar is a nice perk. The arcade they have here is pretty small an pitiful, but that's not what you come here for. The furnishings here are beautiful and comfortable especially for a bowling alley. Only downfall is that the technology appears outdated and could be replaced to match the rest of the bowling alley, however it seems to work fine. Overall this is defineitly the nicest bowling alley I have ever been to and would suggest coming here."
"PA","I didn't even know this place was so close to my house. It is clean and well lit. Automatic scoring and friendly folks. Good happy hour specials and apparently the bar that is attached like most bowling alleys has entertainment on the weekends."
"PA","I will start out by saying that for the most part, our meals were very good, but they were overshadowed by a lousy server.   We waited forever for a drink order and then even longer just to place our order.

My husband ordered the French onion soup, which is a favorite for both of us.   I can say without a doubt that it was the worst we have ever eaten.   Visually, it looked appealing, with lots of cheese and crunchy onions on top, but once you pulled the cheese back, it was a bowlful of bread cubes soaked in broth.   There was absolutely no broth to speak of, so it was like eating mushy bread.   He ate a few spoonfuls and that was it.   We should have complained, but thought the server should have noticed that it wasn't eaten and asked about it.   Unfortunately she brought his salad at the same time, so he had plates all around him.  I had the wedding soup which was excellent.  Loaded with all the typical wedding soup ingredients, and thick and tasty.

My husband had the pork chops, which were tender and juicy.  My Mom had a chicken dish, smothered in onions and gravy which she liked.   They both had plenty of leftovers.   The winner was my veal martini.  Veal slices, lightly breaded and fried, with a two cheese sauce which was excellent.   We all had the twice baked potatoes which were just OK.

Our server never checked on us, never offered drink re-fills, and overall it was frustrating."
"PA","I just got back from dinner with my family at the old place and I can't emphasize enough my disappointment. The service was poor. Our waitress was a nice gal who was working hard, she simply had too many tables because the place was woefully understaffed. Our drinks weren't refilled in a timely manner and she was usually too busy to check on us. I had to go and find her a few times to get things that were missed. 

I don't mind paying the high prices of the old place if the food is good. Unfortunately the food was a let down. Four of us ordered the French onion soup. The soup was so salty it was rendered uneatable. The steak was good, but the baked potato was so dry I thought it left over from lunch. My daughter ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it was quite bland. Everything else we ordered was just ok. To sum it up, our meal was mediocre at best and we were all disappointed. Not one person on our party of seven really enjoyed their meal. 

I express my dissatisfaction with our waitress and she informed me that she would write my complaints in a book they kept. That was it. I left with the feeling that they were happy that they got my money and that they did not really care that my family's dinner was poor. They made no effort to make it right and they made no effect to ease my displeasure. 

This will be my last family dinner at the old place. I will take my business to a place that has better food and a place that values it's customers."
"PA","This place looks like a bar from the outside.  Let me tell you it is nothing like a bar at all.  Probably the best secret in the South Hills. This place can be whatever you want it to be. Stars on the ceiling give it a romantic feel, but the cozy bar gives it a casual feel also.  So whether it's a lobster tail and a steak for your anniversary or a burger and fries after a game, they got you covered. Great service and kitchen guaranteed open until 10pm.  I would give some examples but I eat here weekly without a bad experience. Everything is good. 4 lunch special and 4 dinner specials change daily. Get anyone and you will be happy. If I had to give you my go to item I would have to say the Prime Rib for dinner and the French Dip and Wedding soup for lunch. Appetizer is either Fried Zucchini or the baked Artichokes.  Sunday Brunch is so good I can't even explain in words. If I had to say a negative I would have to say it can be a little pricey at times, but the quality overshadows this. There are plenty of chain restaurants charging the same for frozen dinners. Give it a shot!! You will running back the following week. Promise."
"PA","took my wife for her birthday meal. she ordered the surf and turf, I the prime rib. when her meal arrived it was too beautiful to eat. (she did eat it) the lobster tail was south African, the biggest tail I've ever seen. cooked to perfection also a beautiful filet. my prime rib was the best I've ever eaten. the waitress was excellent and Linda the bartender makes the best Cosmos in the world. Thee Olde Place is the best kept secret in Pgh!!!"
"PA","Was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this place after purchasing a grouping a few months ago. Nice quiet romantic atmosphere, gorgeous ceiling, low lights, and fireplace. From the outside you'd think it was a dive bar next to a tanning place but don't judge a book yada yada. The menu is amazing. Huge, varied, and gourmet. Tasted just as amazing as you would guess from the descriptions. About 20 a meal for dinner per person. Id have given it 5 stars but we went at 3:30 and there was only one other two top in the restaurant and we were still there until 5, so plan for a leisurely meal; though I did notice they do take out as well."
"PA","Awesome place for a working guy to get boots and work clothes esp Carhart stuff ....I have gotten a few pairs of boots here and also got a pair of boots resoled here and it was worth every penny"
"PA","I don't know how this site can be trusted  I wrote a great review for a Salon, Hairtique that corrected every hair problem I had and it was put under not recommended reviews!  I then wrote complaint of review placement and the complaint replaced the review which disappeared all together!  Eileen Hyland  at e mail address eah189@gmail.com Will
yelp Respond?p"
"PA","I just checked in to Hairtique site and was shocked and that is the word I want to use to see my review was relegated to ""Not recommended"" review because soft wear thought it was too positive!! Eileen Hyland Milliken"
"PA","Do you want to have Red Hair? Shiny, healthy hair? I did and by an accident or fate I found Hairtique! I came to Chris with hair so damaged from another Salon that color absorption was impossible to achieve. In one visit I went from dry and porous hair to a healthy vibrant Red!  Compliments on my
Hair are non-stop and so I continue to go to this hair-saving wonderful hairdresser at a salon that while there you are made to feel valued as a client by each member of the staff as you are offered an amazing array of homemade pastries!  Could it get any better? No!  So this is now my Salon, One that will give you the ultimate in healthy hair with the color you always wanted!   Eileen Milliken. 8/25/14"
"PA","I DID like this place for over 30 years and was a customer of Linda, one of the owners for that long.  I was always good to her and we were 'friends'.  My last appointment there she was too busy dealing with interruptions (phone call, checking foils and stopping in mid-stream to finish off someone), as she is with every single appointment I have ever had. She lost her focus on what I wanted and cut away, totally changing my cut and I was not happy with the results.  She told me to go home and work with it the next day.  The next day came and it was a mess, when I told her her, her LARGE ego was hurt and a wk later she ripped me a new behind b/c I didn't like my cut.  Really?  This is how you treat a long-time customer, yell at them for 45 min b/c your ego was hurt?  At first she REFUSED to fix the cut.  After I TOLD her she would fix it, did she then do it.  She then totally screwed me, by cancelling my root color at the last moment a week later!  STAY AWAY FROM HER!!!   You wait and wait at every single appointment, and unless you have much time to kill, go somewhere else.  I am much happier since I left, there IS life after Linda @ Hairtique.  AND, they have NO integrity.  I talked to her sister Chris, after the ordeal was over and she offered me a refund, twice!  I still have the voicemail offering it to me,   Linda REFUSED to refund the service, even tho I was inconvenienced for 2 wks and did it at HER convenience.  Do yourself a favor and keep stress to a limit, as well as your time and find anther place to go.  Please note:  I am not the first customer of over 30 yrs who treated her very well that she has done this too.  It is HER way or you are out the door!  There is NO arguing with her BIG ego!  Stay away, far too much drama between the two sisters!"
"PA","GO TO PLAN B!  This is NOT a shop you want to give your business!  I have been a very good and generous customer for too many years.  If you are in Linda's chair (one of the owner's) you will get an excellent cut/color BUT, you will wait!!!!  And wait.  I can't remember a time I raced to get there and did not have to wait 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, even an hour, b/c she tries to do too many things,  and so, you wait!!!!  Also, I recently went to get a hair cut and she lost her focus, b/c she had to stop and finish someone and then stop again to check foils and then stop again to answer questions and she totally changed my style (that I was growing out 6-7 months) and she knew when I left I was not happy, but she said to blow it out myself tomorrow and it would be okay, it wasn't and when I told her it was a terrible, the worst, with no rhyme or reason, and that it took me an hour to blow out and how frustrated I was, she imploded on me for 40 min, telling me she couldn't look at me!  It was ALL about HER and not my terrible hair cut that I had to force her to fix, making it even shorter and still treated me horribly, no one believes my story, that ME, being the customer, she didn't care or try to make it better at MY convenience,and after all those years.  Her partner, her sister offered me a refund, I never asked, and I still have the voicemail confirming our talk and the refund and yet, no refund. After all the wks of aggrevation and  frustration, they shot their integrity to hell over a $49 check!  REALLY?  STAY AWAY!  There are many other salons that do really good work and you are geared to the customer.  I found one I love and there were many recommendations to me.  So, go to Plan B, Plan A, Hairtique, nah!"
"PA","I really wanted to like this place. I really did. I had originally started coming here because I bought a groupon and was looking for a new stylist.

My total experience here includes 3 haircuts, eye brow wax, and a full head of highlights. The highlights were the icing on the cake and definitely are what made me not want to go back for good.

My stylist was a very personable woman, but in the end she wasn't very good on listening to what I wanted. 3 seperate times I did not get what I asked for.

The absolute worst part about this place though is that every single time I've been here I've been rushed in and out and felt very unappreciated. Whoever is running the books and appointments there really needs to get their act together. If you can't handle high traffic then do not OVER BOOK yourselves. I've schedueled all of my appointments well in advance, so it's not like they were squeezing me in.

Atmosphere is also stuffy and unwelcoming. 

I decided to give it 2 stars since my stylist was a very nice lady."
"PA","I had the misfortune of running into a deer 3 weeks ago and had to have front end damage repaired. I was referred to Liotus & Winter by a co-worker that that had body and paint work done on multiple vehicles there. The work they did on my truck is great. It looks even better than before I hit the deer! The paint work blends perfectly and the fact that the truck was wrecked is not even noticeable. The truck also rides and drives perfectly. They were pleasant to deal with and kept me updated many times throughout the repair process. They were also able to take care of my rental car return for me so that I didn't have to get a ride from someone else when my truck was finished. I would absolutely recommend this shop to anyone. They were very helpful and very appreciative that I chose them to repair my car."
"PA","I had both of my card spray painted and they worked with my insurance to fix both cars with no cost to me. It took a little longer than I would've liked but they did good work."
"PA","I've gone to this place twice with rear end accidents and they have gone out of their way to turn such a crappy situation into a pleasant experience. Both times, they set up really cool rental cars for me, and this time, they had my car done a day early. Everyone who works there is super nice and I literally have nothing but good things to say about them. They even offer lifetime warranties on their work. Just a great place! Highly recommend."
"PA","I set up my appointment a week in advance.  I was told it was not an issue to get it done in one day.  When I showed up at the scheduled time, I was told ""oh was that today?""  Late in the day I called to see if I could pick up my car and it wasn't done and was told it would not be done until the next day.  When I went to pick it up the following day I asked what happened.  The guy,(George) who had mishandled my experience from the beginning, proceeded to blame me saying that there was no way that job could be done in one day.  If you'd like to be blamed for their shortcomings, you should take your vehicle here."
"PA","Great place for cheap designer names. 

Marshall's is the type of store you go to on a rainy day and sift through the racks for hours. I have found all types of deals at this location. Everything from True Religion jeans for $99.99 to Polo shirts for $29.99. Be sure to check out the shoe section for spectacular deals as well.

This location used to be a hidden gem a couple years ago but, since the economy tanked Marshall's is seeing a lot more customers so the selection is not as good as it once was. It seems like now as soon as something is put out it is snatched right up.

Be sure to check the packaging BEFORE you buy as a lot of times previous customers will open them up to see what all is inside and then not buy it and leave it there like that.
 
If you can't find anything check out the near by TJ Maxx as both stores are owned by the same company."
"PA","Not impressed, but it is what it is.  Much like the other two stores in the plaza that offer much of the same savings.  I always find it weird that they have a TJ Maxx in here as well, especially since they are owned by the same company.  They should have saved that other store front for another business that would have been a bit different.

The merchandise is about the same as any other location (read that as: browse, browse a lot).  Finding a particular item in here is not an easy task.  But it can be done.  You just have to give it time and keep an open mind.  Sometimes this location can be a mess with customers opening packages to see what exactly they are about to buy and that can be an annoyance.  One thing that I do like is they have a fitting room, so even though those jeans are cheap, you can still try them on to make sure they fit before you get them home.

Saving a few bucks never hurt, but you may not always find what you want or need here."
"PA","Wow! I did not know the concept behind Marshalls!?  So many deals and for such small prices!! I was absolutley amazed!  Go here! get some deals before the rest of the world goes and buys all the good deals!"
"PA","The lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude. Will not use this garage in the future."
"PA","Amazing! I tell everyone about Penn Automotive!  After moving to Pittsburgh I was worried about finding an auto repair shop I could trust but I am so glad I found them! The best!!!! Thanks so much Joel & crew! Highly recommend them."
"PA","These guys are excellent. Friendly, conscientious, full if integrity. Plus the best holiday decorations around!"
"PA","I was on vacation in Pittsburgh and had a muffler problem. Penn Automotive took a look, told me what I needed, but was unable to fix it that day due to scheduled customers. They also told me it was safe to drive, just loud and annoying. They didn't charge anything. I told them I couldn't give them repeat business since I was from out of town, but would surely give them a good review. If I did live in in the area I would be a regular customer. Thanks again"
"PA","After someone backed into me, needed a little bumper repair. After hearing horror stories of auto mechanics, I was dreading finding a shop to fix my car. My State Farm agent recommended Penn Automotive. They were AWESOME. They made the whole experience very pleasant and super easy. They got me in the next week and gave me a loaner while they had my car for 2 days and did a wonderful job. They did my inspection while they had my car and did not try to sell me on anything.

I highly recommend them to anyone!!"
"PA","THE BEST! They care about their customers and the cars they work on. It is so evident.
I had concerns because my brakes were grinding and thought I had to have those or the routers replaced. i called around and Penn Auto was able to squeeze me in the following week.
I dropped my car off and they looked at it right away. To my relief, they explained that my car was fine and why the grinding was happening. While I waited, they turned the TV on for me and had a very nice waiting area.
They didn't even charge me for looking at the car--I know other shops would have or would have tried to replace the brakes.

I will be returning!"
"PA","I personally believe that this is one of the nicer GE in the area. For some reason the inner-city ones seem dark and dingy. Also, I was at the Waterworks last month and they are renovating this to make it a Market District. If you don't know, now you know ;)"
"PA","I love this grocery store. Excellent selection of organic produce, a lot of prepared foods, nice salad bar, a decent amount of ethnic groceries separated by style/country, and a great butcher. The cuts of meat here are better than most grocery stores in the area. The only better quality I've found is at Whole Foods, but you pay the price for it! The cashiers are overall friendly. I also frequent the pharmacy and the staff there is very efficient and helpful! Also, there's a Starbucks in the store! Nice touch. :)"
"PA","We like this supermarket - close, convenient, and actually well-stocked! Seafood and meats are fresh, and for a supermarket, it actually has a fair amount of specialty items.  Fruits and vegetables are of excellent quality, and they have a large organic section, which is nice. Probably the biggest ""perk,"" however, is the fuel discount you get at GetGo. That, and the quality food keeps us coming back for more!"
"PA","This Barnes and Noble is huge, and it is in such a great location: right in the Waterworks Mall!  Anytime I am trying to make it through the long wait of Burgatory, I find myself going to B&N to spend my time.  They have games, books, music, and all sorts of fun stuff to keep you occupied.  

They also have an awesome cookbook section in the back of the store.  It is a food lovers paradise."
"PA","The food here is very good. I've frequented the restaurant many times for sushi, noodles, rice, and plenty of their other dishes. The atmosphere is also great and the service is very friendly. I would definitely recommend Taipei if you're craving Chinese and sushi."
"PA","This was a nice surprise.  I really like sushi, but I don't like having to always drive into the city for decent sushi.  I recently discovered this place just a couple of miles from my house located in the suburbs.  I've tried it twice now.  The first time I was a little nervous about trying the sushi... again, due to its location.  Fox Chapel is better known for Starbucks rather than good ethnic food.  I had the curried chicken and the steamed dumplings.  These were both of good quality.  I thought the curry with the chicken lacked a little flavor, but I'm from the caribbean and used to west indian curry.  The dumplings were nice because they actually were light and not too heavy like they usually are.  I think probably the best chinese in town is the Sesame Inn with a few locations, but this place is fine.  What I am really impressed with is the Sushi.  I had lunch there today and was impressed with the servie and the chef.  The service was really good... maybe a little too much attention, but better that than the alternative.  The Chef seemed to be a trained sushi chef.  I'm guessing he learned his trade in Asia.  I had some excellent quality white tuna, which was delicious.  I also had the spicy scallop with avocado sushi.  It was really nice with great texture with the creaminess of the avocado and sushi and the crunchiness of something else (not sure  what).  I also had the crabmeat sushi, which was pretty good quality.  The rice had good flavor and the right amount of stickiness.  The sushi was wrapped perfectly.  The chef was helpful and very nice.  I would have preferred authentic wasabi instead of the pasty type stuff you get everywhere, but again that's pretty standard.  I didn't try any of the rolls.  I don't typically eat rolls, because they usually are pretty heavy and one of the reasons I eat sushi is to offset my typical gluttony.  However, the selection seemed really good and I was told by another customer at the sushi bar that the TAI PEI 101 Roll was great.  It should be with a $24 pricetag for a roll.  The ingredients are 7 oz. of lobster, eel, asparagus, onion, cucumber, and seaweed salad.  If this place were in the city I would probably just give it 3 stars, but the fact that it's in the burb's and has this good quality justifies the 4 stars.  And, they deliver!"
"PA","Consistently excellent.  I enjoy their sushi and know when I get a chicken dish I don't have to guess if it is eatable always good white meat.   I typically do take out and it is well worth the drive"
"PA","Really good food and good service. The Chinese is the best and most authentic in the area."
"PA","Today I treated my mother to lunch here because I had a Groupon. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer which I have to admit was AWFUL! They cover it in a tempura batter and it was to thick and flavorless.

But besides that we decided to go for two sushi rolls. The first was the lobster roll which was delicious! And the portion size was big. Second was the Figu or Fugi roll with crab and tuna! The crab salad they served on the side was fantastic was our favorite thing of the meal! Most definitely would recommend the sushi as for the other dishes not sure of but everyone in the place was raving about their rolls..."
"PA","I used to frequent Tai Pei once a week or so, but within the last few years, it has gone severely downhill. The food is greasy, way too expensive, and they use massive amounts of MSG. I got terrible MSG poisoning from Tai Pei and ever since then, have gone to Jimmy Wan's down the road."
"PA","I'm very particular about Asian food. Let me emphasize very one more time. Very.

I usually have poor experiences, but I was pleasantly surprised with Tai Pei. Both times I dined there, I was greeted, which seems to be a lost art these days, and seated immediately. My waiter was just around the corner and greeted me with water. Both times I ordered sushi, I was able to see it being prepared, which is always a plus. My waiter was quick and served me as soon as the sushi was ready. The second time I went, I ordered sushi and an entree. The service was good but took a while for my main dish to be served. I only mention this since the restaurant wasn't packed.

Still, the food was wonderfully prepared. I consider Tai Pei one of my favorite spots!"
"PA","We visited with a Groupon last Thursday. 

We ordered the Hot and Sour Seafood Soup, the black bean chicken, szechuan beef, and lamb with scallions. 

The soup was awesome! Very spicy!

The rest of the food was awful. It was tasteless... the meat had a weird fluffy texture.... there was zero flavor. It was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager. 

He said the kitchen would make new dishes. 

They brought three new entrees. They were again completely flavorless, but warmer. I couldn't taste salt or pepper  or garlic or even feel any heat. It was awful. 

We paid and left. 

yuck. 

I used to go here as a child. I remember the sushi was always good. Maybe that is the thing to order!"
"PA","Dr. Uhl is the best cat doctor on the planet!  She listens to my concerns, returns telephone calls, and explains everything in detail.  I love her!"
"PA","They take great care of our pets here. We rarely have much of a wait, and all of the staff are courteous and talented in handling and caring for pets. All of the vets we have met with were professional, friendly, and very capable."
"PA","I still take my dog to Dr. Resek at VCA Fox Chapel.  She is wonderful.  So thorough and knowledgeable.  She is very polite, friendly and kind.  I highly, highly recommend."
"PA","We have a new puppy...  Chocolate lab.  So far he's had Parvo, giardia, worms, and probably stuff we don't even know!  He is very healthy now.  VCA was very accommodating, saw us quickly, and even helped us out a few times without charging (quick consults).  We highly recommend VCA"
"PA","Truly, the kindest, most gentle vets I have ever met! We recently moved to Pittsburgh, and one of my cats was dealing with an ongoing sickness. We went to VCA Fox Chapel, and I was pleasantly surprised by how kind, caring, and gentle the doctors were. We worked with Dr. Miggins and Dr. Resek. In the end, we ended up having to put our cat to sleep. Even then, Dr. Resek was amazingly patient and kind, and gave us the time and space we needed. Yes, they are expensive. But you are getting great care and more than that, you can rest assured that they truly have your pets' best interest in mind."
"PA","I will never again visit the VCA Fox Chapel, and I caution against you doing so as well.  I took my extremely ill, very old cat there two days ago and we were dismissed out of hand.  No tests were run by Dr. Resek and we were sent out the door with a diagnosis of general food poisoning.  This morning, my cat's condition was visibly worse - she has not eaten in four days - and I called them for counsel.  After 2 five-minute long periods of holding, I was again dismissed by the office staff and told that the recommendation of the doctor was to continue feeding her bland food.  MY CAT IS NOT EATING.  

They were also kind enough to offer me the option of coming in at an elevated ""emergency rate.""  Thanks, but no.  I instead took her to another provider who was thoughtful, thorough and who diagnosed her with acute kidney failure.

My question to the folks at VCA Fox Chapel is this: if you do not care about sick animals, why are you in the veterinary profession? I will be posing this question to them directly.

In the meantime, I advise you, Reader, if you do care about your animal to NOT TAKE IT TO VCA.  They are, in my opinion, directly responsible for the unnecessarily prolonged suffering of my dearest friend - an elderly sweetheart who at this stage in her life deserves far, far better.

(And I would like to point out that I granted them one star because Yelp made me.)"
"PA","I took in a very nice pair of leather boots to have shined and waterproofed. They did an excellent job in a timely fashion during a very busy time of year (the holidays). It was also very well priced! I recommend them for any repair, cleaning, or preserving."
"PA","I took a high end designer purse to be fixed here! It turned out better tan expected! The fixed the strap without any hint of repair! They do a great job on shoes! Great place to do business!"
"PA","Been taking shoes here for years.  It seems as if they are willing to tackle any shoe repair at a fair price. The staff is responsive, friendly and 'customer satisfaction' focused. I refer to them as ""The Shoe Doctors"".    I highly recommend this service."
"PA","My wife has been taking all kinds of shoes and boots here to be cleaned for years. She's always been very happy. I recently dropped off a pair of my own boots to be repaired. It was a pair I'd had for over 10 years. My favorites. The leather had completely torn out of the soles, the soles themselves were full of holes, cracked and falling apart, and the heels were worn down to almost nothing. Honestly, I would have had no problem if the folks at Fox Chapel Shoe Service would have said, ""Sorry, we can't save these. They're beyond repair."" But they inspected them, and said they'd be ready in a week. A week and one day later (who cares if they're a day behind if they're doing quality work, right?) my wife picked them up. When she brought them home, I was shocked. They looked like brand new boots. Re-soled in beautiful leather soles, perfect hard rubber heels, new insoles, and they were cleaned and polished up, too! And, I do believe I smell some kind of waterproofer or other conditioner on them! My wife tells me the man at Fox Chapel Shoe Service apologized for this shoe repair being so expensive. He must be crazy! IT ONLY COST $65! I would have paid him $165! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone. They're the masters, as far as I'm concerned."
"PA","while visiting the burgh i needed to hit up a pier 1 so I checked online and found this gem of a store...at first I thought it was at the pittsburgh mills area....but didn't see it so I called the number and they told me exactly what exit to take to get there which was very helpful...I probably would have gotten lost if they hadn't been so detailed on the phone.

I arrived and a worker asked if i needed help and led me exactly to what I came for and this was a large store beautifully laid out and displayed........it helps that fall decor is my favorite....

The checkout went smooth and they even emailed my receipt......

I only wish I had more time to shop!"
"PA","Typical Pier 1 location. My only complaint - and this seems to apply chain-wide - is that they NEVER have more than one of the products that we're purchasing. I feel like every piece of furniture that we've purchased has been a floor model. I'm not joking.

Regardless, the staff here is very nice."
"PA","Meh, Pier 1 I can love or hate you, depending on the season (or should I say how you rush the seasons).  It delights me when you are in the summer/push to fall season and you have all the different colors in the store.  But I have to say that I am totally not into you when you start putting out candle holders that are to resemble reindeer.  I try to stay clear of your store when this happens.

It's like a higher end tchotchke store.  Sure you could find something of your interest in there, but definitely not an essential that you'll need."
"PA","Excellent espresso, with quick service.  Priced right too.  Parking can be a little tricky but worth the stop."
"PA","Solid coffee choice. A bit cramped for seating and parking can be a challenge both with safety and space availability. Convenient location and service is consistently good."
"PA","Love their coffee.
They need to add help in the morning.
With all the moms and high school kids ordering double latte whatever's there is a line to the door from 7:45 to 9:00.
I'm not going to wait for ten minutes for a cup of plain coffee.
Usually buy beans there and make at home. But now when I want to stop in to grab a cup to go, I go elsewherel
They should have someone who only takes straight coffe orders. They would get more business."
"PA","One of the best latte's I've ever had. Damn good I tell you. And they even put a little heart with the cream. What do you know."
"PA","Good coffee - I'll give them that. But beware when using your debit card here. I don't know if it's their software or employee error, but on two separate occasions I was charged twice for the same cup of coffee and pastry here. Both times I went in, and they promptly rectified it - but kind of annoying, no?"
"PA","I'm not a big fan. They've won me over. They've got a great menu of all kinds of tasty mixed espresso based drinks in addition to the basics. More than a neat little corner shop, they have great coffee. This may come from the fact that they roast all their beans in Pittsburgh for their 6 locations. They roast a good bean and it's noticeable. Priced like any other coffee shop, why not stop in here over some Starbucks or McCafe if you're in the Aspinwall area? This might be a new spot for me for buying my own beans for some homebrewing too. Again, can't stress enough the difference starting with a good bean makes.
The baristas were very friendly and fun too. They had no problem fielding my barrage of questions about their brand."
"PA","OK, so I promised I'd be back, and I made good on that promise. Went there this morning to refuel - this time with lattes. I must say our coffee was tasty and since we didn't go for foam, they were about right in terms of the volume. Definitely a great place to stop in for a cup of coffee from now on when I'm making my way to work. Thanks guys!"
"PA","This place is right around the corner from us, so we figured we would give it a try.

The coffee is delicious, and they have a nice selection of crumb cakes and other goodies to enjoy along with your jolt of caffeine. Our baristas were friendly, and were definitely efficient in moving things along at a nice clip.

I docked two stars, however, when both of our cappucinos were served with less than one third of the cup full with coffee. Yep, you heard me right - the drink was 2/3 foam, which really is excessive. I wasn't expecting a gigantic coffee, having ordered them as small cappuccinos, but it would have been nice to have a little more coffee in my cup of coffee... The coffee that we did drink was tasty though.

Will be back to make sure it wasn't just a one-shot off morning for the barista..."
"PA","Good prices, better coffee.  The food never looks good so I haven't tried it.

I sometimes stop here for coffee before work, the baristas are always friendly--even at 6:02 am, right after opening. If you're in the area I recommend it over the Starbuckses (what is the plural of that?!) in Giant Eagle or B&N in the waterworks mall."
"PA","Somewhat disappointed would best be the title for my review.

Before I begin, let me say that I have been to other Coffee Tree Roasters. I also am an avid coffee drinker and therefore have a fair amount of knowledge that can be used to compare this place with others.

I visited awhile back. Upon arriving I immediately didn't feel welcome. There were four baristas there and I had to wait over a minute before one of them even greeted me. After ordering I decided upon a mocha. It tasted like hot chocolate. Where was the coffee flavor? All the while I noticed the four baristas standing in a corner laughing with one another while giving off an ""exclusive high school club"" vibe. Geez!

AND....when I left (mind you there was only one other customer in the lobby) I took up my dishware, as well as some others on a nearby table and the dude working just gave me a look and didn't even say thank you! Things like that really bother me. Let me tell you, as somebody who has worked in retail and food it can be a PAIN to be friendly towards customers, but it's just something that should be done in that business.

Bottom line: Not terrible, but very underwhelmed by the coffee and service. I highly recommend the Caribou Coffee right across the street. The baristas have always been pleasant and the drinks quite good! I have had far better experiences at the Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside and Squirrel Hill which tells me that this one certainly can become better!"
"PA","Good drinks and service. Found a dessicated fly in bottom of my latte once but outside of that I have been satisfied. Just hope they look in the cups more often."
"PA","Good selection and service"
"PA","I have purchased many high end pieces of luggage (Tumi, Briggs & Riley) from this location with the understanding that they are adding value to my purchase over that of online or airport retailers should I need a repair as they are certainly not less expensive.  Well One of my B&R bags is in need of repair.  The bag was purchased Dec-2012 so it is not that old and it is indeed covered under the lifetime repair of B&R.   I stopped in today to see what could be done.  They could not repair the bag and did offer to send the bag back to B&R for me for the small fee of $35+tax. Really, I could walk down the road a bit and have the UPS store ship it for half that price.  What value are they providing me?   It is a shame that the brick and mortar stores are unable to provide value over online and this is one easy way to do it.  A Shame since I used to be a really good customer."
"PA","Best place in da 'burgh for the frequent traveler!"
"PA","First and far most people , I never write a bad review.  So imagine what an average experience I had. Actually, this isn't even a bad review. OMG but the food was just so average.I've been to better Thai restaurants in the past. The pad thai was not good and that's what it should be!! The curries were very rich with vegetables but again weren't delicious. I have nothing against this place, but if you have had really good thai food in other places, then you have raised the bar and won't like this place. So if you're trying Thai food for the first time...don't hit this place. Sorry for being honest, but look, I'm really obsessed with Thai food and have tried most of the thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, and this restaurant is not going on my favorite list. I don't care how many awards they have hanging on they wall. Just not going back there. Who cares what I think though, everyone has a different taste. So you might like it, just not me:-/"
"PA","Love the staff and LOVE the thai pad.  Yummy!"
"PA","Really good Thai food.  Very friendly service and management.  Food is prepared promptly and is consistently good.  I wish that they DELIVERED!!  We eat their food often.  The decor leaves a lot to be desired, though."
"PA","Ok food...nothing great...many better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh!"
"PA","This is my first Thai food restaurant I have eaten at in Pittsburgh and I love it! The Tom kha soup with vegetables is delicious and so is the butternut squash curry. The mango sticky rice is the best dessert!!"
"PA","Okay food.  Number of other guests is often zero - uncomfortable."
"PA","Bumping up my stars because I have recently found out that they use a soy sauce in their sauces that is gluten free! Feast away, my fellow gluten intolerants and celiacs!"
"PA","Thai Place has very light, extremely flavorful food and is my favorite Thai restaurant in 'Burgh (and probably anywhere). Most other Thai places in this city have extremely greasy food that I get sick from. 

It is located across the street from Waterworks mall, in small and very quiet little building.

 I have tried many things on the menu including their fresh spring rolls, fried spring rolls, dumplings, tofu curries, chicken curries, garlic chicken, pad thai, etc... everything is excellent and always comes out promptly. Many of their apps come with a sweet white plum dipping sauce which is my favorite thing in the universe. I would put it on everything if I could.

 Definitely try a curry bowl or two, the pad thai, and any of their soups. I've had them all and would recommend any of them. Most dishes can have tofu substituted in, which is a plus for my veggie friends. They have fried ice cream for dessert, which is pretty awesome, but im usually too full to eat it. It is a tad on the expensive side, but for the quality and service, I am always willing to pay!"
"PA","Their General Tso's Tofu is slammin.  And they have a ""raw spring roll,"" which is rice paper around... tofu and greens and something else?  It's a unique flavor with the sweet, peanut sauce.  Totally awesome, and totally worth the trip."
"PA","Excellent food with great service."
"PA","Great place for weekday lunch.  Best Pad Thai around."
"PA","I got Pad Thai take out when I was in Pittsburgh on business and it was pretty good.  The portion was decent, however I finished it all in one sitting.  It was $17, which had I not been on an expense account would've been way more than it was worth."
"PA","I tend to prefer this location of Thai Place because it is always so quiet.  The menu seems to be identical to that of the Walnut Street location.  

All of the curry dishes are good here, as are some of the simpler dishes.  I especially like the Penang curry, and the sauce for the chicken with garlic is excellent.  They also include a lot of really good, fresh vegetables in all of their dishes, which, to me, is a plus.  While I haven't tried many of them, the chef's specials seem to be very original to the restaurant. 

The service is always prompt and excellent.  The only drawback to that I can think of is that the prices are a bit high, compared to other Thai restaurants.  However, I always leave Thai Place feeling pleased and satisfied."
"PA","Best place in town for all your keys/synths needs. Ask for Tony or anyone really , everyone is very helpful"
"PA","I have been a customer at this music store not only for gear since I started playing drums, but also for 5 years of drum lessons. They have great staff who are all very knowledgeable about the gear they sell and I have yet to find better prices in any other music store. They treat customers like friends but they don't try to ""sell"" you things the way the big corporate stores do. If you need any kind of music gear, but it at N' Stuff Music."
"PA","This was one of the best music stores that I've visited in Pittsburgh. Though not the best in Pennsylvania it had a pretty good variety of instruments and the prices weren't insane either! They had a used section that was full of guitars, amps, keyboards, and other instruments to tickle your fancy. I was particularly interested in the keyboards and ukuleles and was very pleased! 

If you're a guitar fanatic you'll definitely love it here. The service was very helpful and really friendly as well."
"PA","Very helpful and friendly staff.  Prices are unbeatable.  I rented 4 overhead mikes for a mere $42.00 for 4 days including a mixing board!!  Wouldn't hesitate to rent from here again.  Rental process was very straightforward."
"PA","Best service, best return policy, best selection and prices in the area. After purchasing my first and then second vocal processor and being dissatisfied with the products, Pianos N' Stuff glad returned each of them. I am now a satisfied owner of a Digitech processor which would not have been possible with out the knowledge and consideration of store staff. Highly recommend this store to all area musicians. It's worth the drive!"
"PA","This place is a total hole, and I love it. So many bars in Pittsburgh boast a 'Dive' status, but really just cater to hipsters who want dingy, but still crave structure. Moondogs is a great blues club with ample room, great sound and a hard working bartender. The drinks are cheap, and not great, but if you keep it simple, they do the trick. It's an older crowed, which is fine for me. The covers are cheap and they get some great acts. I went to see State College's Miss Melanie and the Valley Rats, and I'm so grateful I did. I plan to go back this weekend, and probably many more times."
"PA","My girlfriends and I (the Girl Posse) were looking for something to do on a Saturday Night.  Being that we're all married 30-something(some with kids) music fans, we don't always get a chance to get together and head out to a show.  But somehow the planets were aligned and the whole bunch went out to Moondog's for some great live music.

This is another one of those places in which I can't believe I'm the first to review.  Moondog's is a local institution, people!  It's been around here ever since I can remember.  Rusted Root played here in their pre-""Send Me On My Way"" days.

It's everything you want in a small music venue.  Although does mean a slightly cramped seating area and the requisite long lines for the restrooms, it's a great intimate venue to see live music.  And Moondog's brings in the music!  It has everything from rock to blues to folk music.  The Starlite Lounge Restaurant is next door and you can order food from there and bring it into the club.  

It's local music folks.  Come out and support it!"
"PA","Great sales staff! I was looking for a particular car that I was unable find anywhere and lo and behold Tower Auto was able to locate that specific car (even nicer) within days and the price, well unbelievably great! They have my business for life!!!"
"PA","The sale/price/trade all went smoothly.  The salesman proundly presented a clean carfax.  The car has been good except:
1.  a google search of the vin revealed that the front bumper, front  fender, doors, and rear fender had all been replaced at the auction house (manheim) apparently to escape Carfax. All of this was on the sales slip from Manheim.  The sales guy had to know, although he claimed the buyer never told him.   Slick. 
2.  after a flat tire, it was discovered the spare was missing.  after maybe 10 phone calls, and another 10 emails, several visits, and a month, a new wheel (non matching) and tire were provided. 
3.  Several serious car people have told me that they are known for scratch and dent cars, hence the on-site body shop.  

Those the facts in the case, as I know them."
"PA","We bought our car here and they were really nice and helpful.  They gave us a fair price on our trade in.  The sales rep was very nice and a pleasure to work with.  Car was exactly as described."
"PA","This has to be the best cigar shop I've been to, with respect to selection, price, and customer experience. Highly knowledgeable staff that are friendly and always willing to offer a similar selection to expand your horizons. Must check them out."
"PA","By far the best cigar/ pipe selection  with a lounge in the Pittsburgh area!  Great employees and very knowledgeable as well ! A must to come by too!"
"PA","I like to smoke a good cigar. And I like to talk to others who enjoy the same - and especially like to talk to people who KNOW a lot about them and why they are so good. And so it is at Allegheny Smokeworks. Mike is incredibly knowledgeable and has terrific recommendations. His humidor is filled with delights that he can attest to personally. There are the standard, find in every cigar store brands as well as some he gets exclusively. I always find some things I enjoy and never walk out empty handed. 

There's a small smoking lounge in front of the store which is always filled with aficionados puffing away in a cloud of smoke - which is noticeable as you approach the place from afar. But that's ok, if you are offended by that you'll not likely find yourself anywhere near here. Great place - might be in my top 2-3 favorite cigar stores around."
"PA","Best cigar selection in Pittsburgh. Their pipe tobacco blends are fantastic, I recommend RLP-6. Great atmosphere!"
"PA","Don't come here for the atmosphere, come for a taste of what Slavic/Polish food is supposed to taste like. As someone who spent years in Pittsburgh but never ate here until recently, it is a revelation. 

I know this was on the Food Network and all, but it's not really a dive as places in this area go. It's a standard working class lounge with a restaurant in the back that happens to serve darn good food, if that kind of food is your cup of tea. 

If you have never had standard Slavic food, you won't find it much better anywhere outside of the old country. Go try it."
"PA","We're visiting from Milford, Ohio.  We picked this place because we love eating at places featured on the Food Network, especially on Diners, Dives and Drive Ins.  Dive?  Ummmm, yea.  for sure.  I know Guy Fieri says, ""if its funky, we'll find it.""  but I just couldn't imagine him there! 
talk about a small, tiny, bar.   Would NEVER have gone here if we weren't looking for it.  
The waitress/bar maid was VERY nice.  She recommended what was served to Guy; the fish sammy and the perogies.  i've never had perogies.  From what I understand, perogies are very small.  these were huge.  I don't know, I'm sure they were awesome........I just don't think they are for me.  It was  like fried mashed potatoes.   I'm thinking Perogies is a cultural/area food.   Just not something I'm going to crave. 
     The fish sam was good.  
Seemed the patrons are regulars.    
This is not a place I would crave; not a place I would visit again if I were back in town.  But thanks for the experience."
"PA","I stopped in here last night for dinner with my girlfriend.  I had been wanting to come here since I randomly caught it on an episode of ""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives"" and last night was the perfect night for us.  The outside of the building is unassuming and we drove right past it before noticing that we had.  The inside of the building is not much better as it looks like your normal neighborhood bar with a bunch of flat screens T.V's on the wall, a U shaped bar on one side, booths and high top tables on the other and a back dining room.  My girlfriend and I tried to sit in the back but there was something going on there and so we eventually settled into one of the booths.

The bar seemed quite full for a Tuesday evening and our waitress (the bartender) told us that she would get to us shortly after we had seated ourselves.  After only a short wait, she was at our table taking our drink order.  I was actually impressed with how efficient she was by herself with the large crowd.  For dinner I decided to order the famous fish sandwich and a plate of pierogies (3) while my girlfriend went with the buffalo chicken wrap.  Our food came out within a reasonable time period and looked good with both of our sandwiches served with cole slaw.  The pierogies were absolutely enormous, almost as long as my hand and fried slightly, topped with onions and came with a side of applesauce.  Our waitress had asked us if we had wanted sour cream with them to but we politely declined.  They tasted pretty good as the slight fry gave them a crunchy exterior while the interior was soft and tasty.  By the time we were done with them, we had also eaten all of the applesauce as it made a good dipping sauce and helped keep the pierogies moist.  My sandwich was also pretty good as the breading on it was fried nicely and tasted good while the fish was mild.  I topped it with hot sauce and like a true Pittsburgher even put my cole slaw on it which helped to make it taste better. My girlfriend told me that she enjoyed her buffalo chicken wrap and the single bite that I took gave me a nice buffalo flavor.

The bottom line for me is that I am glad that I came here and might be back again depending on what I am looking for.  The food was dirt cheap with our whole bill coming to $22 and it exceeded the expectations that I had given to it whenever we walked in.  However, with that being said, the building is fairly run down and it is bar food and so I wouldn't expect it to be the greatest food you have ever tasted."
"PA","My dad wanted to go to this place because he saw it on TV. I grew up on in dive bars plopped on stools next to my grandfather as he drank Budweisers. Thus we felt at home.

This is a dive bar. A real dive bar, not some phony hipster bar pretending to be a dive bar. Yes, its grimy, yes there will be people shaking from acute withdrawal sitting near you. If you have never been to a dive, or are not sure you have been to a dive, you might want to try somewhere else.

Budweisers are 2.25, food is cheap and comes in huge portions. Pierogies are gargantuan, the fish sandwich is even bigger. Standard bar food on the menu with a few nice Polish selections. Service is nonchalant yet friendly enough. An elderly woman in the back does all the cooking by herself. She is awesome."
"PA","I don't even know how to rate this place.  So we too saw it on food network.  Being from a small down in PA, I can attest, this place is a DIVE.  It is like the kind of dive where a couple of people from the neighborhood surely spend every day in here at the bar smoking and drinking.  You have to KNOW what you are getting into before you go here, and if that makes you uncomfortable, better not go.  Me on the other hand, if they have something delicious, I will go.  The pierogies were 5 stars.  Best I have ever eaten and obviously homemade and HUGE!  The rest of the food was reasonably cheap and pretty tasty.  The wings were pretty great too.  I normally wouldn't even walk into, let alone eat at a place like this, but all of their other food was surprisingly good.  I know darn well when I walked in with my family and kids everyone in the entire bar and the staff looked at us like, there are some city slickers coming in because they saw us on D,D, & D.  Yup.  Damn straight.  Yuns gimme dem dar pierogies up dar over dar."
"PA","Man this place is a dump. If you're not a local or regular good luck feeling comfortable there. It is obviously a local bar first and restaurant second. Certainly not for the ladies or kids. The pierogies were indeed delish and the fish sammo was okay. It was cooked nicely but the fish wasn't all that fresh and you could tell. Btw, I did not pre-order pierogies and I got mine no problem. But it wasn't during peak hours. 

As noted by other posters the waitress was the bartender. A bit gruff, but I've had worse. Music was BLASTING non-stop during my hour there. A Nickelback fan's dream com true. Smoky, but not horribly so. 

If you're a local rummy barfly then this place is for you! But if you're a DDD fan you might want to move on to another DDD spot in Pittsburgh. Not sure why it would be featured on the show. Nadine's was better and they made you feel welcome."
"PA","The food is pretty good especially if you like perogies but good luck getting it. I've been here a few times to see acoustic performances and every time I'm here the waitress spends more time smoking cigarettes at the bar than attending to her tables. 98% of the time I have to go to the bar to get another beer. But damn the perogies are good."
"PA","We went to this place also after seeing it on D,D,and D.
This was after the smoking in places that serve food was put in place. We went with my sister and her not even toddler my two children and ... well we get to the location and almost turned around ""its just a bar"" Defiantly a dive! Took a while to get our food. The bar was loud and smokey! I orderd the perogies since that is why we went there. My son ordered a fish sandwich we orderd a childs spaggetti. some wings and some other things. The fish sandwich was HUGE. biggest i had ever seen.  

The childs spaggetti was big and was shared with two children My son loved it .. i tasted it because i couldnt belive him. It was good! 

THE PEROIGES ----- BLAND~, soggy, not crisp not buttery ... they were greasy. it tasted like bland mashed potatoes between unseasoned dough. 

We drove well over an hour to eat here. BIG mistake."
"PA","Went here because we saw it on the Food Network Diners Drive-ins and Dives.  Their pierogies were the featured food of course.  It's just a small bar.  We went on a Sunday afternoon and there were a bunch of old guys sitting around the bar smoking and talking about the old days.  The bartender was also our waitress.  Aside from first-impressions, the service was good and the pierogies were amazing.  Three big pierogies for about $7, great for sharing.  We also ordered a burger with fries to share and it was good too!  And CHEAP!  We got stuffed, couldn't even finish everything for $15.  If you don't mind the smokey, old-time bar feel, then I highly recommend.  On their website, they say to call ahead for the pierogies."
"PA","Hard drinking local crowd. Simple pub food. Friendly and relaxed local bar with a holiday by holiday light show extravaganza.  Unfortunately experience marred by intense smoke. After an hour there hair and clothes, reek of cigarettes.  Had to leave because my eyes were burning. Ive been there before and it never seemed this bad. I thought all restaurants were supposed to be smoke free?"
"PA","This little smokey hole in the wall is a really cool spot.  The decorations are what bring everyone here.  Every inch is covered and it is something to be seen.  If you are in the area at Christmas time it shouldn't be missed."
"PA","Ok kids, come on...the place isn't called 'El Bistro de' anything, nor will you find it under any Zagat listings. It isn't located on the Riviera, or anywhere near Shadyside or any other trendy nose-in-the-air (which is STILL laughable in Pittsburgh) acceptable neighborhood. It's in Blawnox, and it's called Bob's GARAGE...

Bob's isn't the penthouse lounge at the Carlton...it's a neighborhood bar. And as a neighborhood bar goes...with the karaoke...it was actually a very pleasant little joint to hang out in for an evening with friends and sing our guts out.

YES...they still allow smoking...YES, people drink well drinks there...and yes, the food has gluten in it and probably comes out of a freezer bag.

Gordon Ramsey didn't rescue the joint, and the decorating most likely involves sales at Party City and a hot glue gun.

Bob's Garage does not pretend to be anything that it isn't. Wanna pretend? Go hang at a Big Burrito joint, or dial up Kevin Sousa. Bob's is a funky and cool little joint to hang out in with a group of pretty decent people, all ages, who are out for an evening of a few drinks (I saw no drunks) being served by a bartender who was very friendly and helpful, in a location that does kind of look like Pool City exploded during Christmas time and landed in the middle of Party City during high season. It's comfortable, laid back, and the karaoke guy on Thursdays, John, was very kind and friendly, and did his karaoke like a pro. He also had a very nice singing voice himself. He didn't rip apart his karaoke singers like another 'Oke' leader in the burgh, who mostly caters to the gay bars.

The other revelers that night were in a range from very good to ouch, but the atmosphere is such that if you can't carry a tune in a bucket...sooooooo what. People clap, and allow you to have a good time.

I can't say I'd ever look at this place from the outside and say 'HEY - let's try it for lunch!' Or dinner for that matter. 

But for a fun evening just hanging with friends in an unpretentious atmosphere, and jumping up to sing...bring it on. The drinks aren't terribly overpriced, and no one is looking down on your for what you're wearing, or how badly you sound on a microphone. The more, the merrier.

My only suggestion would be for the karaoke guys to bring back the 'books'. I know that everyone is staring into their palms on their smart phones these days, but really...not EVERYONE. And we had a very hard time scanning a songbook online when the signals were weak and the batteries were draining on the cell phones.

And to be honest - for the smoke whiners - maybe they've upped the ventilation since the last reviews were written, but even though I smoke, I generally hate smoking indoors. And I didn't walk out with the usual smoking bar sensation of having a nicotine trail follow me home.

Bottom line, if you're regular ol' folk, and would like a comfy location to have some fun with other regular ol' folk...park it in the Garage. Bob's Garage.

ADDENDUM: Went back for a second dose on a Friday night, and had just as great a time. The difference was that we tried the food. I had a Reuben and my friends had a fish sandwich and the other a steak. Reasonable prices, not uppity gourmet, and not horrible. Just plain ol' decent bar food."
"PA","I've driven by this place so many times that I decided to try it for lunch one day. It's not exactly inviting from the exterior or, for that matter, at the front/side door. But if you're hungry or thirsty, you'll overcome any initial reservation you might have just developed. Once inside your visual senses are overwhelmed by what appears to have been an explosion of confetti and Christmas decorations that magically seem to be suspended from the ceiling like psychedelic stalactites. Once you accept that you're in an alternate universe, you can mosey up to the bar or find a seat at one of the small tables. I chose the former and noted the abundance of ash trays scattered all over the bar. Since I'm not a fan of eating where there is a heavy layer of cigarette smoke, I nearly got up and walked out. Luckily, no one at that particular moment was firing one up so I stayed. 

I needed a beer (one of those days at work where I felt I owed it to myself to just have one...) but alas, the tap selection consisted of two lite beers (never!) and two summer ales (blue moon and summer shanty - neither of which will ever pass my lips). So I figured it was gonna be one of those days from start to finish and just ordered water. 

Perusing the menu left me feeling like this wasn't my day at all so I opted instead for a burger. While it was ok, it wasn't great. Maybe I was so distracted by all the crap hanging over my head and worried for my personal safety that I couldn't properly focus on my meal. Service was good and friendly but the atmosphere and I don't match. And, for that matter,  equivalent bar food can be found at your neighborhood tavern and you won't have to have your senses assaulted. I won't be back."
"PA","I've only been here once, but it was on December 23, which is about the equivalent of strolling into Mecca during the Hajj. In wintertime, Bob's Garage becomes a local destination because the two-room building gets completely overloaded with holiday decorations. The effort apparently takes two full Sundays and about 250 man hours. It doesn't get pulled down until the first Sunday after Valentine's Day, which is about how long it takes for the holiday hangover to pass.

Three phrases you won't hear inside:

- ""I come for the food.""
- ""The air in here is just so fresh!""
- ""Don't put that decoration up. It's too tacky, and we don't have any more room.""

What makes it all especially nice is that it's all part of a massive December fundraising effort on the part of the Spirit of Christmas charity which aims to buy toys, clothes and food for needy North Hills families. As if the lights aren't enough to dull the senses, we experienced an overpacked bar and bad karaoke (redundant, I know) that evening. Lots of shouting about raffle tickets and door prizes. A talking Santa train overhead. Not exactly a place to sit and have a normal conversation, but that can be foregone in favor of the joyful cacophonous maelstrom of holiday revelry."
"PA","Cozy place, Christmas decorations year round and great karaoke"
"PA","They have 4 gourmet cheese sticks with marinara sauce for $7.95. No, I lied, they're not gourmet, they're the frozen kind and they're awful, why would they charge so much for them?
However, this place is fantastic! Lots of Christmas decorations everywhere, and I mean everywhere! They also have karaoke at 8:30, the crowd is older (your parent's age), they dance and sing along; it's a great time. They get packed so expect to stand around, the place is small but no one cares and they will hang out for a while, it's hard to get a table at this smoky ""garage"". If you don't smoke, you can hang out at the add on but it's not as fun as the bar area. This is the place to have a good time!"
"PA","A must see in Pittsburgh.    If you have not been , it is a little hard to explain but I will try.

This place is theme decorated (to a particular holiday) for lengthy period of time.   Example - January - they were still in their Christmas Theme.   The sensory overload on the decorations within the bar is very amusing similar to the feeling you have when you are looking at a house decorated with 10,000 Christmas lights.     Some of the pictures on Yelp do not do the place justice.


This particular night was our third stop and it was Karaoke Night.    The place had a great vibe.

My only knock on this place is that they still allow smoking.   Beware if you are not used to smokers because your sinuses will go into overdrive.    I will go back but need to pace myself."
"PA","I love this little bar for a couple of reasons. Its a very friendly place full of unpretentious regulars, mostly the 30 plus crowd. Drinks are cheep. I'd almost call it a dive but not quite because the place is always decked out beyond belief from whatever the last holiday might have been. When I say decked out beyond belief, I seriously mean just that. Ya' won't believe it. The bartender's are always nice and actually know how to make drinks. The bar itself is cool; its a rectangular shape  so everybody is facing one another. The food is very top notch although regular bar fair. The only knock I've got on the place is that it gets a little too smokey for my taste and they sometimes have karaoke, which I'm not always in the mood to hear. 

If you're driving through that part of town, stop in for a drink. You'll enjoy it!"
"PA","This place is a don't miss for a different kind of holiday night out.  It is pretty much unmissable on the side of Freeport road because of its amazing amount of lights.  They actually close down for 4 days to put up the decorations in here, and it shows.  When you enter you come into a bar area with seating all around a rectangular bar - this bar still allows smoking.  There is also a side room (similar to a glassed in porch) where it is non-smoking and they serve food.  Beer fans beware as they have a wide selection of American let downs (see: Miller Lite), but you can get away with the Yuengling on tap.  I got a burger and fries which was large, round, pinkish, and not at all juicy, but still pretty tasty, and very cheap (I think $4.50) and the fries were not bad, and also cheap (maybe $1.50).  We had a good waitress and although we sat in the 'non-smoking' area I still felt a little bit like I left a smoky bar when I got home."
"PA","Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, yay Fourth of July, and Maholo.  This place is decorated for every season and occasion from floor to ceiling.  Think luau meets Christmas.  So that's kind of fun.

Bob's Garage is pretty small and appears to be a local yocal hangout.  Want to be an apt observer of yinzers in their natural habitat?  Stop here for a brew and relax.  I felt like I was at home - it's friendly and comfortable here.  Its one of those places you wish you could walk to.  But unless you live off of Freeport Road you're going to have to drive, so keep your drinking to a minimum.  

Bar food is available and service is quick and friendly.  Oh, and this is one of the last remaining establishments that I've seen that allows smoking.  So be prepared for that."
"PA","Food is bar food nothing great. But it is a good time. Karaoke was fun if you know your songs from the 70s and 80s. Fun crowd that just wants to sing and drink no drama"
"PA","This place is a riot. The explosion of Christmas decorations I encountered was hysterical, but I loved it. I went here with a meetup group for karaoke. We had the room in the back reserved so I sat down right away. I didn't realize you could smoke inside as I had never been there before. I reeked of smoke and didn't appreciate that part since I'm a non smoker. People crowded in and we had a very nice waitress who was left alone to basically tend to the whole bar. She was kind despite being stressed out. I didn't have any expectations but I really enjoyed the karaoke. I ordered a beer, a bologna sandwich with onion rings, which were good. So then I reeked of smoke AND onions. I went with the flow and would go there again with a group. The bathroom was small and very clean and I had to make my way through a tight squeeze of men and women to get to the bathroom. Some of the crowd was questionable...but hey, the people watching is incredible. Recommended!"
"PA","As a non-smoker, it takes me a while to get used to the stink. As a karaoke lover, oh yea, it's the best place in the city! I would just come for great karaoke (my husband DJs every Thursday!) and a nice atmosphere."
"PA","AWFUL!  The hub bub about the decor, well, it's cheap and trashy. The place REEKS of stale cigarette smoke (and this is coming from a smoker) that hits you like a ton of bricks the moment you walk in the door.

On a whim, we decided to try Bob's Garage for the first time on Saturday, July 13, 2013. The place was all but empty and no one greeted us or told us where to sit, we just kind of stood by the door waiting to get noticed before finally choosing a table on our own. No verbal greeting or acknowledgment of any kind as we stood there. Ordered a glass of wine and beers for my companions. I suddenly felt ill (didn't know at the time, but it was a sudden attack of vertigo), alas, I digress. I felt as if I were going to pass out. Sent one of my companions to get me some water. The waitress came over and said ""Oh, I would have gotten that for you"" in a very snotty tone, as if we breached some etiquette by NOT asking her for it when she was clearly not attentive. We ordered cheese sticks in case it was low blood sugar, but it was not. They were frozen and certainly not worth the price. The waitress could tell I was having some sort of issue and brought our check over ""in case you need to leave suddenly""...REALLY? She never asked if I was okay, needed her to call someone, needed help or anything, but was more worried about collecting the bill than a customer's well-being. I will NEVER go back there again. Oh, by the way, 2 draught beers, 1 glass of wine (that I did not even sip) and an order of cheese sticks (frozen and not very good) was almost $22, what a rip off!"
"PA","Says they deliver on here... Wrong & wrong again & should not be checked! I like Applebee's & thought the delivery was something new for the Pittsburgh area... Don't know if this is something Yelp does or something someone checked off... But not cool!"
"PA","love love love the steaks they make!!! there are times when I beg my husband to take me to applebee's because I want their stake; I eat stakes everywhere, even the Japanese Steak Houses where they only make steaks weren't like Applebee's :)

the only No at this place was, I oredered pine apple juice and it was so old that it smelled and tasted and kind of even looked like Mold;

but other than that I love theirr Stakes :)"
"PA","Loved our server Jaime!

Loved their Brew Pub Pretzels!

Love their Take Two Seasonal Menu, the Green Goddess Wedge Salad, and the  Lemon Shrimp Fettucine!

Rocky Bleier was there! Yay!"
"PA","My wife and I meet there for dinner after work occasionally and generally feel the food is pretty good for the price and usually have decent waitress. The last time I was there the waitress kept disappearing and we had to ask another one for another drink and she never came back to see how we were doing. By the time we were ready to go we were pretty disgusted and I asked another waitress to take our check, cut the tip to 10% and told her to keep it instead of our waitress. While going up Greentree road I looked up at the restaurant and saw our waitress outside smoking. I blame the manager for this. Whoever the manager is should not let this go on."
"PA","I have been a fan of this Applebee's since I was a little girl who would come here and only eat their amazing cheeseburgers and layered chocolate cake. I was heartbroken when said layered chocolate cake was taken off of the menu, but now that I'm of legal age, other parts of the menu have made up for this. More on that later.

I think compared to other restaurants in the chain, this Applebee's is a little bit smaller than other places, but the essentials are all there: comfy seating, a bar, TVs, and most importantly: good service. Plus, it has the essential Applebee's staple: a darn good menu. In recent years it's also adopted a ""light option"" menu, which is positively delicious and provides perfect alternatives to that delicious but not-so-good-for-me burger I used to eat on a regular basis. Steak with shrimp and potatoes and the perfect balance of spices on top comes pretty darn close to my childhood favorite dish.

Also: this place is home to one of the biggest margarita's I've ever seen. Joe's Crab Shack still takes the prize for 1st place, but 2nd is no small feat (no pun intended) and this place is much closer and easier for me to get to. Also, free parking. C'mon.

All in all, I love this place now as much as ever, and I plan on continuing to come here in the years to come!"
"PA","Waited for last hotel bus which scheduled before 1pm from Conventional center to hotel from 12:40 to 1:00 pm. No bus showed up, I called Front desk, they told me be patient.  I waited and called them again around 1:30pm, they hang up my phone after I explained the purpose of the phone call. I called them third time around 1:35pm, no response.  Hope they will improve quality of their service."
"PA","Pros: great place to host a event or special occasion, awesome cookies, clean, room service food good, and great price for a double tree 4 miles from downtown. 
Cons: loud A/C bathrooms small, countertops low, outdated, bathtub needs changing"
"PA","Nice to find a dead fly on the bed after checking in! Nicely done."
"PA","Stayed here overnight and wished we realized how busy of a hotel this place was before checking in. We stayed over a weekend in the summer and upon check in, the lobby was packed with 2 large confereces going on. Not enough parking to accomadate the lounge crowd on Saturday night and hotel guests. We returned back to the hotel after dinner and couldn't find a parking place. Also, next time I am offered a room with a sleep number bed, I will definately pass."
"PA","Where to start ... First we checked in after trying to park for seemingly forever (we noticed on the way out - that the sign directing you to the parking deck is only posted on the way OUT of the property - not on the way in so when you come in late and it's dark, you'd never see it!  Room was decent - no complaints for the cost.  We went down to the restaurant to get a snack for my daughter and a glass of wine for me... it took FOREVER!    Finally we got our order and were off to bed ... not!

There was a group in the room next too us who were talking loudly (almost screaming) and it all came through the door...Our mistake was not calling down to complain (which in retrospect we should have but we kept thinking eventually they would go to bed :(  Finally after 3:30 am it died down.

When we went to tell the front desk what happened, the girl had this 'deer in the headlights' look and did express regret we had a problem.  I asked if we could receive a discount on our room and she checked with the manager and quickly came back and said no since we didn't call them about the problem :( but they could comp us a breakfast.  I relayed our story from the night and our feelings we didn't want to return (esp when we saw the line at the hostess stand) but took the voucher since it was that or nothing.

The restaurant was worse for breakfast.  We stood out by the hostess for at least 10 min and couldn't even get the hostess to let us know how long it would be before be seated.  Two other couples and us were all in the same boat. Hostess was totally overwhelmed. Walked back over to the desk and expressed out findings and she asked us to walk back over.  Long / short the line finally disappated quickly and we were finally seated only to find that there was only a buffet ... so the question that begs to be asked - why was there a line to begin with?!   There were tables and servers?  Bad planning and execution?  Why wasn't there a sign indicating that it was buffet or nothing?  

Honestly, if we didn't have the voucher, we wouldn't have stayed after a walk through the buffet area .... The quality was awful... No plates for oatmeal, stale bagels, beyond runny eggs, undercooked sausage and no pancakes or waffles...

On an ancillary note, the hotel was swarming with middle, high and possibly college teams.  This didn't bother us since we've been on a dozens of these trips with our daughter.  The problem with it was that the management of the hotel seemingly didn't notice that they were totally booked and staff appropriately for the weekend.  

For $135+ for a room for the both of us - to stay 8:30 pm until 10:00 am - with all the problems we had with the sound control and service...definitely was not worth it.  The night before we were in the Penn State area and stayed at a Super 8 for a 1/3 of the cost and had a great night sleep and decent free breakfast.  

If we find ourselves back in the area ... would not stay here or recommend it."
"PA","This hotel is old and janky and the friendly, helpful staff seems to know it. I felt bad for them. I can imagine they deal with a number of complaints so kudos to them for really getting that they are not the problem. 

The entire hotel staff - front desk, house cleaning, shuttle service, restaurant - do try to make your stay pleasant. They really are the only thing this place has going for it. 

I actually had to change rooms. I have never done that before but the first room I had apparently had the ""towers"" AC right above it and it was going to run nonstop. Luckily, it wasn't an issue for me to move. 

The hair dryer shorted out on me both mornings of my two day stay. My hair was dry enough so I was rather amused by this. I needed to print off my boarding pass. The business office is not complimentary here, but they did offer free computer use and printing for boarding passes. Great! Not so great? The fact that the network moved soooooo sssssllllloooowwww that I couldn't get to the area to actually print out the boarding pass in the allotted 15 minutes. The hotel subs out the services for the business office. Not a good idea. 

I mentioned at the front desk that I didn't have a room service menu in my room. One of the people working said that was probably because of ""renovations."" I'm not sure what the two things have in common at this point, but it wasn't worth it to question it. 

At one point, I was going down the elevator and ran into a woman who was delivering room service. The elevator moved really slow. She sighed and shook her head. 

""This is an interesting hotel,"" I commented. 
""Oh yeah,"" she said with a laugh. 

Again ... not a bad place. It serves its purpose. But God help the souls working there. I think they probably deserve better."
"PA","acceptable because it is a convenient drive to most parts of the city with free parking.  It is dated and huge.  I dislike sleep number beds but that's what they have.  Bathrooms are tiny.  In the lounge I had some of the best chicken wings and the rest of their menu seemed impressive and reasonably priced."
"PA","Big hotel. Not bad. Bathrooms way too small I had to dry off outside the bathroom. Priceline for good rate."
"PA","I love the Radisson!!!"
"PA","I was there for couple of drinks with my friend who was stay a night at the hotel. 
It was the worst experience i have ever had in a bar in Pittsburgh. When i got there my friend was having dinner at the table and i joined we. I was there only for drinks so i asked the server if i could have a drink but she suggested re restaurant is closed so i will have to get a drink at the bar area. Shortly after that i see her serving other ppl around me in the dinning area and when i asked her about it she told me it was last call and they were also having a drink so it was ok. Honesty it was a weird experience and i wish i could complain to somebody about it being it's such a big chain of hotels. I asked the server If I could talk to the restaurant manager she said sure but the manager never showed up."
"PA","Dont' mind me... I'm just practicing for when I don't remember stuff. Like two weeks ago when I stayed here for three days? I was surfing the Pittsburgh yelp pages, and knowing I had to return to Pittsburgh next week for software training, decided to ""check out the hotel"" that we'd be staying at for four days. When I got to the review page for this Radisson, it hit me....... ""Been there, done that.""

Short opinion here. Being a native SoCal person, I benefit from a great choice of hotels, throughout the Western states. So for years, when I've had to go back East, I prepare myself for older properties, musty rooms, and usually....... older bathroom fixtures, accompanied by really aged tile grout! If any of the above rings a bell...... you won't be disappointed.

It's really not that bad, but we West coasters are a bit spoiled. They do have a decent bar-restaurant. But as others have mentioned, this property exists on multiple levels. For instance...... the parking lot in the back? You get off the elevator on the 5th floor. If you're going to the bar, THEN you hit ""Lobby"" and end up at the bottom of the hillside, which is still elevated above the access road. Sounds a bit convuluted, but it's not that bad. I think I just like to complain a bit....... you get that way after your 39th birthday.   :-)"
"PA","I can't believe I haven't reviewed this hotel yet. I have been here many times with no problems. Not too glamorous but has what you need. It is kind of like a maze and sometimes hard to find your way around but that isn't really a problem. The rates are always very good and service has always been hospitable and easy to find when you need them. The rooms are always clean, with nice comfy beds...but about my last time....

My last visit started out much the same...easy to check in. They accept pets and even have a pet floor, which I had never asked about before. This time I had my daughter and her kitty with us so we were delighted when we found out pets were okay. The deposit for the pet was very reasonable compared to other places also. MY ONLY PROBLEM was that whomever cleaned the room before we came thought it was okay to leave the comforter covered in dog hair...I guess maybe because it was a pet floor? LOL....We called downstairs and someone came right up to put a whole new dressing on each bed and apologized profusely. That was our only problem. The food had started to slip some before this visit, but during this visit the food was wonderful with plenty of choices. We even checked out about 3 hours late."
"PA","This hotel is in need of a renovation. This becomes most apparent when you look at the bathrooms, which have fixtures and mildew growth both from the seventies. I've stayed in motels that were cleaner and better appointed.

I could have done without the Sleep Number bed, but that's probably more of a personal preference than anything. However, it appeared to me that the money would have been better spent on updating the rooms themselves. Apparently it used to be a Marriott some time ago - I'm guessing they decided to drop the brand rather than update to Marriott's standards.

The continental breakfast was a crime. $12 for buffet style eggs (from a bag no less), sausage, french toast, and oily potato cubes they were trying to say were home fries is unconscionable. Passing on this gastronomic atrocity, I decided to invest my money in an english muffin and two 4 oz. yogurts (only option is Strawberry Banana? Really?).

At least there was a pretty nice pool where we could... oh, closed for private party. Just as well.

Thankfully this was a business trip and the client is paying expenses, otherwise I might have actually felt upset."
"PA","I stayed at this hotel for four nights, and on the last day attended a memorial service hosted in one of the hotel's banquet rooms.  Overall experience was adequate...specifics follow.

1)  Room quality - 4 stars.  Most rooms have Sleep Number beds, which actually kept me awake on the first night as I spent 45 minutes trying to find the perfect setting for me.  The second night I just reset the bed to Sleep Number 50 (median) and fell asleep in short order.  Room was clean, not too dated, and nothing stood out as being in need of repair or cleaning.

2)  Internet access - 2 stars.  All rooms have both wired and wireless access included in the room cost.  The wireless access is a peer-to-peer network, so my corporate laptop was prohibited from connecting (our IT group smartly limits connections to secured networks).  The wired connection is very slow during the day, and at times during mid-day would return connection timeout errors.  Late at night it was adequate.

3)  Services - 4 stars.  Housekeeping was daily, and the only negative was that somehow each new bath towel that was left had single, long black hair on it.  Once I could forgive, but three times in four days?  Service call to address a clogged toilet was dealt with promptly.  Room service is not as expensive as expected, and our server was prompt and friendly.

4)  Restaurant - 2 stars.  The in house ""Rivers"" restaurant is not worth going to.  The $12 breakfast buffet consists of scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon, bad French toast, horrible home fries, bad fresh fruit, and decent (store-bought, I imagine) pastries.  A la carte breakfasts are not much better...the pancakes were pretty bad.  Dinner is the same...food is bland, overpriced, and usually either under- or over-cooked.  The pizza bar next door is not always open, and is not as good as your usual neighborhood pizza place.

5)  Facilities - 3 stars.  The exercise/pool room is decent, although during our stay the hotel was overrun with hundreds of teenagers and the pool water was so cloudy that we avoided it entirely.  The banquet/conference catering is really well done, very accommodating and professional.  The current manager is very friendly, present, and professional.

Overall this is a solid if unspectacular place to stay if you are on a business trip or need a place to host a gathering.  If you're an individual traveler save your money and stay elsewhere."
"PA","Clean. Friendly service. Good price (from hotwire). Very fast Internet with no glitches. Has pizza parlor in lobby. Not bad if you ask me."
"PA","Somewhat dated...REALLY large and easy to get lost -- multiple towers with multiple levels.  If you can think of a labrynth, then you will understand what I mean about this hotel.   The rooms and the service were really nothing spectacular.  Parking can be somewhat of a hassle if you don't know where to park -- there are three different areas on three different levels of the mountain.

Beware of the room service as well.  I like tea before my coffee and would get a cup from room service.  They charge for the tea.  They add tax.  They add a hotel service charge.  They add a hotel delivery fee.  And then there is the gratuity line that is added in.  WHAT?  Don't add anything to the gratuity line...that is what the delivery fee and the hotel service charge is for.  Starbuck is half the price after all of the additional fees and it is right around the corner."
"PA","This place is pretty good.  The staff is pretty knowledgeable and helpful depending on who is working.  

They are priced competitively with online resources, but the product is readily available.

What I do not like is that everything comes prepackaged.  My old HBS in Boston allowed us to measure out our grains and hops to meet the needs of the recipe.

As I get to know the place better I am sure I will give some better reviews."
"PA","Alrighty, I now officially feel sort of bad about my last review on this place, but it was indeed an honest review that was based on my few experiences at the time. Here is my updated review in which I have been into this store maybe three times in the past six months and the dude I have dealt with here has been generally very helpful. 

His knowledge and time that he took with me to figure out various equipment technical details to update my draft system was really appreciated. I also truly appreciated his honesty when he wasn't sure what the correct answer was on the grains I wanted to use for a recipe. I won't hold it against him that he isn't a fan of IPAs either. 

Another thing that I would like to mention is that their prices here are right in line if not better than most the popular online homebrew stores and you don't have to pay shipping. I am now back on their bandwagon."
"PA","I really want to give this place a higher star rating but can't because frankly I have experienced much better in the terms of friendliness and service. This place definitely has everything you need for home wine and beer making but for the most part I feel a store like this should have friendly people working here that are ready and willing to answer your questions or at least when you are the only person in the store.......acknowledge you. 

I have been into this store numerous times and have the impression that everyone in here is sort of pissed off to be here. I'm fairly new to home brewing (within the last year and half) and I have questions. This hobby has a lot of questions to be asked, don't act like such a pretentious elite home brewer that I am reluctant to ask my questions. On my last visit the young dude checking me out was literally prying a thank you from his lips. I don't want my ass to be kissed but come on, say hello, can I help you, or thank you have a nice day. I feel that they think that I have to buy products from them although I can easily buy anything that I buy from these guys, on-line. I'm all about keeping it local but if I wanted impersonal service I could order this stuff on-line."
"PA","If you are a homebrewer like myself, having a local place for supplies and knowledge is key. They recently expanded their Noblestown Rd location, and have double the stuff. If you are a wine maker, they have a great selection of wine making tools, supplies, and ingredients, and for the beer brewer, they have a great selection of commercial and in-house extract kits (try their Belgium Wit), grains, dry and liquid yeasts, bottles, caps, and every kind of accessory you can think of. If you've never brewed before, they have reasonably priced starter kits, as well as drafting systems and advanced supplies. The staff is very knowledgeable, although you may get the occasional ""that's a dumb question look."" The prices here are a little higher then buying online, but I think it's offsetted by convenience and not paying shipping and handling.

I stumbled into their Country Wines location in the North Hills and found out something that you might find useful- that location has a bigger bottle selection, and they sell clean used bottles for $7.99 a case. Trust me; if you've ever needed used bottles, this is a cheap convenient way to get them. They do not do this at the South Hills location."
"PA","My boyfriend enjoys brewing his own beer and the guys here are wonderful. They always have the supplies and if they don't they can recommend places to get them! Everyone is always very nice and knowledgeable!"
"PA","My boyfriend, a beer-brewing novice, and I stopped in here to pick up some supplies. The salespeople here are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly, and talked us through the whole process, leaving us with contact info and the assurance that we could call any time we needed help along the way. While I can't really speak to the fairness of the prices, I would for sure recommend a stop in here for anyone looking to learn more about the brewing process. They carry supplies for wine brewing as well."
"PA","I graduated in 1964, but return regularly to campus to see the tremendous progress made over the years,  The original campus, hand built by priests in the 1870's, has been a work-in-progress--and that is a GOOD thing.  I know many people working on Campus.  And they are great and smart.  The many new buildings are architectural beauties.  But the best and most wonderful thing about Duquesne is ""the people"", both students and staff.  Catholic Duquesne gave Jewish me a GREAT education and wonderful memories.  I am in contact with my fraternity brothers on a regular basis and we all have nothing but wonderful memories of our time on campus.  And we do our part to make Duquesne even better."
"PA","I'd qualify Duquesne as a school with a lot of solid potential that hasn't yet become what it could be.  The university has obvious financial difficulties despite what undergraduates assure me is relatively high tuition.  It seems like the strongest programs here are pharmacy/nursing, business, healthcare ethics, and psychology."
"PA","This school is a terrible deal for what you pay.  I got my math degree here, and I feel my educations was average at best, so why did I pay twice as much? They don't have rigorous science programs here, and even their beloved pharmacy school seems to be self-serving to artificially inflate graduation rates.

 The money does not go to the professors -- many of them are part-time adjuncts who do not earn much, so despite small classrooms, they are burnt out and don't have time to devote to their lesson plans.  I do not support this unethical business practice.  

The campus itself is garbage, there were cockroaches all through the dorms and food quarters when I was there 2006-2010, the dorms are old and falling apart, there is no campus life to speak of.  

In general there is just really no reason to come here and pay twice as much money for this garbage school.  I left this school 60k in debt and could have gotten the same or better education elsewhere - I DO NOT recommend this school."
"PA","I spent five years at Duquesne, and if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing!

I moved out to Pittsburgh for college all the way from California--state, not California, PA. Duquesne was such a welcoming campus, and all of the teachers and staff are very caring. There are so many great resources, both on campus and off campus within a short distance. Duquesne's campus is like a world all it's own, being nestled on the Bluff right in downtown.

I graduated two years ago, and I'm still thankful for the education I received. I moved back to California, and I have to admit that I miss Pittsburgh and Duquesne a lot!

(as an aside, my brother also went to a Catholic university in Chicago that cost almost $10k MORE each year, and the resources at his school weren't nearly as nice as at Duq.)

Edit 12/24/14: P.S. Someone else (who studied math) mentions in a 1-star review that Duquesne doesn't have any rigorous science programs--that couldn't be FURTHER from the truth. I graduated with a science degree and believe it was a FANTASTIC program and that every other science student I came across in other programs thought the same thing. With my education I believe I could get a job at any lab in the country."
"PA","I really enjoy the school and the education i've received so far. and now that i'm graduating i think that i'm happy i got a pretty decent education. 

of course the school has some programs that are better than others, but of all the schools i've met people in, most students at duquesne are always studying or worrying about school work, which is actually a good sign. other schools, students are more worried about parties then their exams. the school is working on upgrading and adding more features that are needed all around, kids still have good times too at school concert/events, wireless is okay, library is okay, computer labs are everywhere, free school printing, sports are decent, greek life of some sort, dining is okay, jamba juice, two starbucks, barnes and noble, apartments and dorms... 

overall good school to get your education at. o yea.. the rings are top 10 most recognized rings in the world... (which reminds me i should get one)"
"PA","New digs are nice!  Service was solid.  Food was solid."
"PA","Perhaps it was an off night, but we were really disappointed in our take-out. My husband's pork fried rice was not fried rice...still don't know what it was. His Gen. Tso's chicken was flat and my cashew chicken was flavorless. In the past it has been good food."
"PA","I was really excited the day after new years to get a bagel with my best friends I traveled all the way from Milwaukee to see. Upon arrival, the place was pretty busy with people who obviously frequented the establishment often. We don't have many Bruegger's in Wisconsin so it was my first time here and it was not an enjoyable experience to say the least.

It began by me placing my order and asking for my sandwich without the tomato spread. The worker actually interrupted me mid sentence to ask which bagel. I politely stated my preference and moved along. The older gentlemen working the cash register asked what we got. I said what bagel and my boyfriend also asked for 2 hazelnut coffees. The cashier responded with, K..... I asked okay? and he responds with, I need to know what size.... I shrugged it off and was like well whatever maybe he's bummed to be working on new years.

Then, when I get my bagel it has the tomato spread on it, which I politely asked for it without, yet was interrupted. The man literally says, ""Ma'am I don't know what you actually ordered and TOMATO is different than TOMATO SPREAD. Like I'm sorry... WHAT?! the sandwich comes with only one kind of tomato.. pretty sure that's impossible to get confused with. I tried so hard to not say a big screw you too. He made a huge deal about the whole thing and if he wasn't so rude when we were paying I probably would've shrugged it off. I had too much pride though.

THEN, he comes up to me and says MA'AM just so you know you were over charged because you ordered incorrectly. You shouldn't do that next time. K. Maybe if you took the time for decent customer service and realize we obviously have never been to a Bruegger's.

And to put this into perspective, I worked at a breakfast place last year on new years day and not once did I feel the need to be that rude to anyone. It sucks but it's not my fault...."
"PA","Pamela is a bad representation of this location! Attitude and lack of hygiene is an issue for this ""employee."" I will not return."
"PA","As much as I typically avoid bigger industry-type chains, I've always enjoyed stopping in here while hanging out in Shadyside. It's at the perfect location at the end of Walnut (though technically on Aiken) to grab something on your way into Shadyside or on your way out. I walked in today and the manager greeted me sweetly. I just picked up a bag of day-old bagels (who can beat a bag of 6 for less than 3 bucks?) and a soda, and the woman was nice enough to offer a free bag of bagels to me! I don't even care if they had to get rid of them by the end of the afternoon, it was an incredibly nice gesture which almost guarantees a stop in the next time I need a quick breakfast or lunch sometime soon. Great upstairs area with Wifi (though limited outlets) to eat and work."
"PA","The staff is very friendly at this location. I love the create your own salad option, and the produce is always fresh. Skinny bagels have become quite the trend, and Brueggers does it justice. At times, the coffee can be mediocre, but the bagels are always fresh, and Brueggers really is a Pittsburgh staple. A skinny zesty egg white breakfast sandwich is the perfect way to go for a lite breakfast."
"PA","Yesterday I received, without question, the most exquisite bouquet from Toadflax. 

My family had been through a lot this past month, but this arrangement was so colorful, so diverse, so beautifully orchestrated, that it absolutely brightened my day and lifted my spirits for the evening.

I'm hesitant to add a photo, as I honestly cannot get a shot that does these flowers justice.

Thank you, Toadflax! You've got my business for sure."
"PA","Stop in here for all of your overpriced candles, orchids, and meditation books and scented everythings. Although I probably would never purchase anything here, it's a nice little shop owned by a couple of nice guys in the heart of Shadyside that's good to stop in when you're in the neighborhood. The ambience here is the highlight, with an aroma of goodness and soft soothing music playing in the background. Sometimes the owners have their dog resting at the foot of the counter, which is another highlight for me!"
"PA","This is a wonderful place. When you enter, you're hit with the aroma of blooming flowers. They sell a variety of exotic orchids that brighten up the room.

I'm especially fond of coming here in the Spring time. They take entire branches from trees and allow them to bloom right in the store. The colors and smells are amazing.

Along with flowers, they also sell bath items such as French milled soaps, body lotions and perfumes. The quality is top of the line but so are the prices.

My girlfriend and I love coming in here just to see the flowers, their wares and their two big dogs sleeping on the floor."
"PA","Books, cards, calendars, and candles galore (and not just the run-of-the-mill ones). This novelty store has many things you might want and might not have thought of wanting but will want after you take a look. Are you in a witty mood? Their wide selection of tongue-in-cheek, politically (in)correct, and sexually (in)appropriate cards will cater to your whimsy. Just looking for some normal books? They have cookbooks, contemporary fiction, and old literature for your perusal. Are you celebrating a special event? They have a large selection of cards in the back for occasions ranging from Thank You to Mother's Day to Happy Birthday to Christmas. Looking for something to satisfy your or a friend's geekiness? They sell products with themes ranging from Dr. Who to Harry Potter to A Game of Thrones. Just looking for laughs? They have an assortment of interesting little thingamajigs that may pull a chuckle out of you and others.

I think you find something there for any occasion. I even purchased Thank You cards here for me to give to my interviewers after my interviews. I also got a relatively normal To-Do list here, but you can opt to choose for something more entertaining. You'll just have to come here to see what they have."
"PA","4.5 stars...

I love stores like this! It's got a little bit of everything funny, geeky, and cool. They have the most random things for all ages, especially if you're into topics similar to Star Wars, Dr Who, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, bacon (yes, bacon), and so on. Aside from random knick nacks, gifts, collectibles, they do have an extentive card (greeting cards) selection, lots of books, and oddly enough an aisle of Yankee candles. 

If you've ever been described as quirky, dorky, funny, or geeky, this is a store for you. If not, I'm sure someone you know is and this would be a great place to find a couple stocking stuffers for them. The only reason I rounded down on the rating was that the prices were a bit high on everything."
"PA","Overpriced, so I wouldn't really buy much, but gosh I love the experience of looking through everything. It's worth popping in for twenty-thirty minutes and seeing all of the cools things you could read (or play with haha)"
"PA","This is a gem in Shadyside. I make sure to stop in here every time I'm in Shadyside. It's a perfect little novelty store equipped with funny quirky cards, books, T-shirts, and little stocking stuffers and the like. To be honest, it's a little expensive and I generally don't buy anything while I'm here, but it's the perfect little place to browse on a Sunday afternoon stroll on Walnut Street with a coffee. I lived in Shadyside for a while and grabbing coffee next door at Tree Roasters and walking in here for a peek became a part of my weekend schedule."
"PA","It's stocked with little knick knacks and other random items. I would say this place is perfect for buying gifts  for a quirky friend.

I like to check this place out every once in a while because I just like window shopping. I don't think I'd buy anything here due to the fact that it's overpriced but I do like to appreciate their merchandise."
"PA","Awesome serivce"
"PA","I found myself in the Pittsburgh area this Christmas season on a quest for an ornament to exemplify our trip and mark the year.  Of course I immediately turned to Yelp for help and Kards Unlimited popped up to the top of the list as a place to find ornaments.  A quick read of the reviews, a tap on the directions button and I was on my way. 

I was there two days before Christmas and the store was all a buzz. There was a line halfway through the store which moved quickly. 

This store has tons of choices. Books, cards, toys, jewelry, knick knacks and - ornaments. The first one to catch my eye was two turtle doves. It wasn't what i was looking for but it did satisfy another quest I am on.  I also liked a set of decorative yet functional measuring spoons. I thought it would make a nice ornament. 

They displayed their collection of ornaments with fishing line tacked to the ceiling with plenty of ""ask for assistance"" signs.  I also noticed a sign that explained the meaning behind their pickle ornament but unfortunately they were out of these.  Had they had these in stock, I suspect my quest would have been complete. 

The sales Team was helpful and polite without rushing even when the store was full. The shelves were neat and the store had a pleasant atmosphere. If I lived in the area I would definitely be a regular.

[On the Second Day of Christmas my true love gave to me... Two Turtle Doves
December 2102 Yelp Challege]"
"PA","The store is really fun, just know it gets crowded quickly, especially around the holidays. Don't recommend going with a stroller in tow!"
"PA","Going into this store is like going into a vacuum.  You loose all track of time.  That's not a bad thing.

I started in the traditional card section and slowly made my to the homemade, more explicit card section.  I didn't even take time to examine all the calendars and knick knacks they had because I was too enthralled with all the cards to choose from.

Between here and Wildcard, I doubt I'll ever step foot back into a Hallmark store.  Better quality in cards and the staff are excellent."
"PA","This place is so quirky and cool I love it. Darren and I spent hours in here just looking. Of course, Darren had his face in the graphic novels (him and his comics lol i like them too btw). I was gawking at everything else including Cat Lady action figures and all kinds of silly stuff. They also have a nice book selections and of course greeting cards galore and t-shirts and so much stuff! Even if you don't buy anything, it's fun to just look around."
"PA","I LOVE this store. Always have to take a look when I'm in Shadyside or have any kind of excuse to buy a card."
"PA","Every time I'm on walnut st I have to make a stop at Kards Unlimited. It's a pretty exciting place and funny enough I have bought some great cards there. For my friends birthday i found a card with a chubby puppy passed out in it's food bowl. I had to have it!

 Its also good for those awkward Christmas party gifts, you know the grab bag ones where you always give a great present and get back a gift certificate to a grocery store whose only location is two hours away. If you're like us and like to give cheap gifts that are nice then this place is perfect! 
We bought a bunch of coffee mugs with pictures of Roger Hargreaves Mr. Men series, you know Mr. Silly, Little Miss Giggles, and Mr. Grumpy. They were fairly priced, around ten bucks each, and they were a huge hit with his work group. It's a way better option than a scented candle. 

They have wonderful tea options! i'm a huge fan of their Tea forte, Belgian Mint Herbal tea! I can't get enough of it. It's sweet and perfect for when your sick or craving something 
chocolaty. 
Overall fun place. Just be prepared to enter very small spaces. If there are any other people in there (which there normally is) it will be an awkward mess."
"PA","Large selection of unique/cute-tastic gifts.  Humerous knick-knacks/books galore.  Very adorable and staff was very pleasant.  Looking forward to going back again."
"PA","What more can I say about Kards Unlimited that hasn't already been stated?  The reviews are glowing and well-deserved!  More than just stationary and cards, Kards Unlimited is locally-owned in Shadyside and has a quirky selection of everything from books, jewelry, toys, posters, games, bath/body, and novelty gifts.  I have found many a birthday and Christmas presents here, as well as plenty of knick-knacks for myself.  Since I moved from Pittsburgh, I haven't been back, but I am going to make a point to visit next time I'm in town!"
"PA","Any type of sentiment that you would like to express Kards Unlimited 5-1 has it in a card, which I think all are ordered by the marker of the cards and then by the type of sentiment. Because of the unique and grandiose assortment you can easily spend a few hours easily going through everything from cards and the other odds and ends (books, toys, jewelry, tshirts and so on). I've spent a fast 15 minutes looking for one thank you card by just being in the middle of the store - not even tackling the back. Rite Aid just doesn't even come close, and I keep returning back whenever I want to snail mail a ray of sunshine to someone."
"PA","Kards Unlimited is, by far, the most fun and interesting novelty shop I've ever seen.  They have tons of the most random things, and I really enjoy buying gifts there.  Most recently, I found an ironic magnetic Sarah Palin dress-up doll for the refrigerator and some very nice bath products for a gift to a very Republican family member.

Every time I'm in Kards Unlimited, I find new and exciting stuff, and I'm always surprised at how reasonable the prices are.  Gotta love this store!"
"PA","What if you got a scavenger hunt list that looked something like this?:

1) ""Where's Waldo?"" complete collectors set
2) bud rubber duckie
3) Hippopotamus necklace
4) Food Face plate
5) Bert and Ernie finger puppets
6) I Heart Guts plushie
7) ""Goodnight Moon""
8) Cat butt magnets
9) Stick-on mustaches
10) ""Family Guy"" Monopoly
11) PacMan candy
12) The Dude Abides t-shirt
13) Unemployed Philosopher Guild doll
14) ""Pickles to Pittsburgh""
15) Over the Hill birthday card

You could knock the whole list out at Kards Unlimited 5-1."
"PA","One of the few non-people I have purposefully sought out and ""liked"" on Facebook, Kards Unlimited has the highest quality and variety of cards I've ever seen. Plus wacky tees. Plus random crap usually found in gift shops at the airport, only with infinitely more edge and non-bloated prices. I always stop in for a visit when I'm wandering around Walnut and I rarely leave empty handed."
"PA","kards unlimited is similar to pulp in dc in that it features offbeat gifts and unique cards, but adds jewelry and literature to the mix.

while i've found gems here in terms of cards, i really had to *search* for them, unlike other stores where i find so many awesome cards i don't know which to pick..and end up leaving with seven birthday cards, spending more money than anticipated, and no money for food*. the back area has more mainstream cards by hallmark and shoebox (read:: cheaper), as well as posters, gift bags, and ribbons.

the gift selection are great and span from make-your-own-porno kits (do you like to do it yourself?) to cookie cutters, noveltees**, journals, children's toys, and items only locals would understand and find amusing.

i appreciate the space dedicated to graphic novels, the corridor of books, n'at***, but this place is brimming with so much product, it's damn near impossible to navigate through the twists and turns, even when you know exactly what you're looking for and where it is.

still, stopping by is a must when on walnut.

---
*priorities, people. at least all my friends will have epic birthday cards!
**seewhatididthere.
***i'm basically a local now."
"PA","A door sign reads ""hiring enthusiastic, energetic and humorous employees"" , so I walk-in. Immediately my expectations are exceeded as a lady behind the desk responds to a radio call from the staff upstairs announcing that her radio (which is strapped to her body) vibrates every time someone calls her and she ""kinda likes it"". I couldn't help but laugh out loud the first 30 seconds I walked through the door.

 Super savvy, humorous and fun: This is one novelty shop you don't want to pass up! I left with unique childrens books & hand puppets for my son, silly sticky notes for my secretary's desk, witty comic novels, and an irresistible coin pouch. It's more than shopping in here, it's a whole experience. Go in, get lots for awhile..."
"PA","I have to stop myself from stopping here once a week and stocking up on cards I don't yet need. Great card selection and perfect for gift shopping, they literally have something for everyone.  I go at least as often as I need a card for some occasion and they always have new things. A bit expensive but worth it to support this great store."
"PA","This is where I go when I can't think of a gift for someone. The store isn't particularly large, but there is such an array of cards, books, tees, stationery, soaps, and dozens of other uncategorizable things. They stock a great selection of books-- nearly every one is compelling, and I never feel like I'm sifting through a lot of less interesting books to find the best ones. The editions are always nicely designed. There is also a great collection of shirts, including Pittsburgh shirts that only a Pittsburgher would understand."
"PA","I stepped in here a few weeks ago while I was waiting for my appointment @ the Apple Store....

This is a very cute Boutique-y shop!
Lots of cool and unique books, gifts, cards, etc.

Lots of Pop-Culture stuff, funny gifts and novelties.

I really liked it in there a lot!

Bacon Flavored Dental Floss, FTW!   ;)"
"PA","Much more than just a card shop. A very unique store. Tons of pop culture stuff. Take your time and look around."
"PA","They have a huge selection of greeting cards in the back, but I've usually come here to browse the books (lots of Kurt Vonnegut) or the stationary and other gifts like that (notepads like ""While you were out"" but with snarky commentary). Not only do you have a ton of options here, but they're very well curated options. One of the very best gift shops around!"
"PA","If you are looking for an outstanding comedy gift, this is the place for you.

Also: a strategically hip book selection, high quality puppets, a wall of giggle-worthy novelty shirts and a jewelry case.  Oh, and KARDS.

Found along the wall: bacon band-aids, insta-Irish accent mouth spray, famous philosopher finger puppets, librarian action figure, vulgar piggie banks, zombie plastic animals, etc.  A tiny sampling of the silliness."
"PA","Probably THE best card and gift store in the East End of Pittsburgh, if not the entire city.  Even the picky and indecisive card shopper (such as myself) can find plenty of good choices.  

Need a present to go along with that card?  You can make a one-stop trip to Kards Unlimited.  There are toys for both kids and adults, gag gifts like beer goggles, books, bath and body products, ornaments and what is my favorite to look at, funky jewelry.  If you're shopping for a literary friend, a bunch of the paper collage-style necklace pendants incorporate literary references (Why, yes, I would like one!).  Even if you're not shopping for a lovable female book nerd, the jewelry is beautiful.

The aisles can get cramped with people browsing, but you can't blame them--there's just so much to see."
"PA","I regret to say that I have walked past this store for four years and never went in. That's four years of gifts that I could have found in one place. The books, staionary, gift wrap, and kooky/fun gifts are all instant inspiration. They have way too many things to classify the store or its demographic, but if you need something unique and have no idea of what it is just go in and look around. You'll find it."
"PA","Such a great store. They stock everything (EVERYTHING), including: cards, hand puppets, necklaces, books, etc... Kards Unlimited seems to take great care in choosing store products for sale. Definitely my favorite store on Walnut."
"PA","Despite the kooky spelling, Kards Unlimited is a great place to shop for a gift. The card selection is extensive, so if you go there in search of a card you're unlikely to head home empty-handed. Even better, there's a wide assortment of knick-knacks and books that are perfect as gifts or impulse purchases for yourself. It's easy to lose track of time as you wander up and down the narrow aisles."
"PA","I love love love this store. It's a mecca of kooky gifts, books, cards, calendars, tshirts, jewelry, candles... pretty much everything you could ask for. I've spent over an hour just browsing, and around the holidays or birthdays, it's the best place to go if you have no idea what to get. You can pick up anything from a barista action figure to chocolate body paint to the complete set of Harry Potter hardback books. And don't forget the fizzy bath salts or the stick-on mustaches. You'll be hard pressed to NOT buy anything before you leave."
"PA","We absolutely loved our stay at the Inn on Negley!! There is so much to review and not enough space to do it. We stayed in the Cortland suite which was so comfortable and quiet. It was a room off by itself which I was unaware of at the time of booking. That made it so much better. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and the decor was spectacular. The only part I didn't quite like was the street noise early in the morning. The breakfast was insanely good with so many choices other than the typical continental. There were eggs, belgian waffles, pancakes, etc to choose from. Each morning breakfast began with a cup of fresh cut up fruit and a freshly baked pastry. The service was perfect with the proper amount of attention without being too invasive. The staff was one of the most polite and courteous I've ever encountered. Thank you so much for making our stay perfect. I hope to visit again some day."
"PA","First time having Afternoon tea time in the States. This place is very beautifully decorated. We had the Earl Grey and peach ginger tea. They were really good and the tea stand was AMAZING"
"PA","Went for brunch with a group of ladies and we had a great time!  The inn is really lovely and it's a great if you want to try something new or different for brunch!

Service is impeccable and the whole atmosphere is just so elegant!  The brunch service is basically a four course meal: fruit, breads, entree, dessert!  And you also have you choice of juices, coffee and/or tea!

All the things we tried were delicious!  There were so many things, I can barely remember.  


They also serve Afternoon Tea, which I'm sure is fabulous!!! So, that's definitely next on my list!"
"PA","I requested a stay at the Inn on Negley when traveling on business back to Pittsburgh.  I lived in town for 5 years and had not had an opportunity to return in more years than that I am afraid. This place was just what I needed. I sought a more personal experience than a canned commercial hotel could offer.

I was so grateful to get to stay in this pristine, classy, comfortable Inn. The staff was welcoming, sweet, helpful, and kind. The room was lovely. 

The best part was waking up in the morning! Breakfast made me feel like a queen on her birthday. The food was perfect. Gorgeous and delicious. The carefully cut fresh fruit salad, coffee, french toast option, and housemade pastries were top shelf! The  creative meals and fresh ingredients were professionally planned, carefully prepared, and out of this world! 

I bought my host a gift certificate for brunch in thanks just so he could share in how fabulous the treatment is. I'd return in a heartbeat."
"PA","If you are looking for a unique place to try for brunch this is the place to go.  Nestled in Shadyside on Negley Avenue don't drive by too fast as you could easily miss the small sign out front.  The Victorian home is a bed and breakfast and the rooms are beautiful with privates bath. I would love to stay sometime.  I have gone twice for Sunday brunch and both times have been absolutely amazing. While the food is delicious the experience of a eating a 4 course brunch  in a old Victorian home is worth the price. For $23 a person, the brunch includes a starter, pastries, entrée, dessert and unlimited tea, coffee or juice. The tea list is extensive and I recommend the mint chocolate-tastes just like the ice cream.  On our last trip we started with a small bowl of fruit followed by the pastry selections-these are always fresh and made in house.  This time it was lemon poppy seed bread and cranberry muffins. They were both absolutely scrumptious and I was wanting more as you only get a small sample.  Next up we got to pick our entrée-they don't have a menu and usually have 4 choices and then eggs any style. I went with the goat cheese, asparagus and leek omelet with potatoes and turkey bacon (loved that this was an option).  My date ordered the hash with poached eggs and regular bacon.  The omelet was amazing and had such great flavor.  For dessert we were all given extremely cute lady bug sugar cookies. The service was fantastic!"
"PA","What a wonderful location!  My sister's future MIL hosted her bridal shower here and with 11 people, we had our own private room.  It was tastefully decorated and beautiful.  The Inn on Negley also has a private parking lot in the back meant for their guests but street parking is plentiful around there, as well.

The tea room is simply gorgeous and the variety of tea is plentiful and delicious!  They even had a blue & yellow tea for us (the bride's wedding colors) and I loved the fact that we could request a different type of tea the second time around.  The food was delicious from the cucumber finger sandwiches to the apricot scones.

What a lovely spot for afternoon tea and I look forward to returning again to Pittsburgh - may want to stay there next time!"
"PA","I've never had the pleasure of staying here but this is where my boyfriends mom stays when she is in town. They've been very nice to accommodate my boyfriend and I even though we are not staying so I've had a few breakfasts here. They food is always delicious- usually a sweet or savory option plus a classic eggs, toast, meat, bread. The French toast is delicious. The bacon is so yummy crispy delicious. Coffee here is really good! 

They have a beautiful back patio and a station with coffee and tea out all the time. So I've spent a few afternoons enjoying that. All the staff has been very gracious to us."
"PA","I had afternoon tea here and I find the scones unique because of the fruit used in scones. Service was good as well and a fair selection of teas. I would def be back when I'm in Pittsburgh!"
"PA","just returned from a three day weekend at the inn with 12 sorority sisters from around the country.  It is understandable why the inn gets such rave reviews.  From the extraordinary service of the staff which was both accommodating AND anticipating, to the beautifully furnished and outfitted rooms  (I stayed in the Braeburn on the first floor which was large, comfortable, and filled with light), to the delicious breakfasts, it was an outstanding experience all around.  I am thrilled to spread the word and recommend your inn without reservation."
"PA","Amazing!

I recently hosted my friend's bridal shower here and everything was absolutely perfect!  Heidi went above and beyond helping me plan from 3 hours away, including taking pictures of the tea room and promptly responding to my many many emails. The Inn itself is gorgeous, and the staff was extremely professional and accommodating. 

A++++!!!"
"PA","This place is adorable and quaint. It's a former house turned into a bed and breakfast plus a restaurant. I had brunch here. The staff was clearly very well trained and put a lot of effort into the details, while retaining it's cozy, intimate, homey feel. The food was also quality."
"PA","The attention to detail at the Inn on Negley is simply impeccable! We had high tea here a couple of days before Christmas, and it was everything we hoped it would be! The overall experience put us in a festive mood and we look forward to going back again in the future! The service was outstanding, the tea delicious, and the Christmas decorations were quite lovely. The tea sandwiches, scones and desserts are why I gave the rating of four out of five stars. They were good, but could have been a tad more tasty. I agree with another review on here that the bread on the tea sandwiches was a little stale. We enjoyed the scones, but they could have had a little more flavor to them. And I would have preferred a different dessert choice other than a small heart shaped sugar cookie, which went along with a bite of gingerbread cake and a chocolate truffle. All in all, we went for the experience and the Inn on Negley more than delivered! The innkeepers were there and were very friendly and gracious. We took a tour of the inn, which is one of the original Shadyside mansions, and the rooms were elegant and filled with beautiful antiques. Again, the attention to detail in each room is like no other. I would love to stay there one day! We will definitely be back for tea in the future!"
"PA","I was the lucky birthday girl at a surprise High Tea party for eight at The Inn on Negley.  The service is as good as it gets.  We placed our first tea order (you can change it up however many times you like!) then the chef came out to explain the food she had made.  For our first tier we had chicken salad sandwich, egg salad sandwich, and cucumber dill crostini things.  The second tier had two types of scones and cantaloupe slices.  The third tier was mini cupcakes, brownies, and strawberries and cream sandwich type things.  Even though the food did not look like a lot it really was filling.     

The atmosphere was beautiful and comfortable.  Not stuffy or too formal at all.  We felt comfortable having a good time while being ultra ladylike.  The place settings were very pretty and just what I expected.  

The only reason I did not give The Inn on Negley 5 stars is that some of the food was better than others.  The egg salad sandwich was dry, bland and the bread was a bit stale.  The chicken salad sandwich, however, was the BEST chicken salad I've ever had.  

High Tea is definitely worth the experience at The Inn on Negley!  I'd love to go back and stay in a room for a little close to home treat some day."
"PA","Absolutely adorable!  On my quest to be a refined English lady I've been on a hunt for the cities best high tea service.  Probably not the most popular past time, but you can't knock it until you've tried it!  And... You MUST try this place!

This is a proper setting for such an event, you almost feel like you need white gloves and a parasol!  And surprise, the Inn is actually an Inn!  Apparently it dates back to the olden days of yore (late 1800's) and is one of those old Shadyside mansions that was converted into an Inn at some point.  But if you have relatives who want something more unique in the heart of a vibrant Burgh neighborhood, I'd suggest here!

Let's get to the tea service though!  It's served from noon to four daily, which is nice for a ""ladies who lunch afternoon"" or a Saturday or Sunday outing for mom.  It's in a parlor, which is small but charming.  There's also an outdoor patio that would be nice if it's not too hot out (drinking hot tea in 80 degrees isn't too appealing).  There's a full High Tea Service for $20 per person, which seems a little steep, but for tea service isn't too bad.  There's also other combo's for around $12, but I'd say go big or go home!

The tea menu is VERY large and there were tons of choices. They give you the main choices between black, green and herbal, but you can also blend them together too.  I chose the caramel vanilla, which I guess is being taken off the menu sadly.  It was delish though... so maybe they'll bring it back at some point.  There were honestly a lot of different ones I would have been more than happy with too!

The one thing I think is very cool and very different is that they offer you a different tea selections with the different tiers of food.  I've never heard of them doing that before.  Usually you get one tea choice and that's it.  I love that you can pair the foods together with different teas for no up-charge.  Very unique and a definite perk of coming here.  

I've been to several High Tea Services and this one would definitely be on the light side.  The portions were small, but surprisingly filled me up for the entire afternoon until a later dinner.  I mean, it's tea service, not a five course meal!  There was a chicken and egg salad sandwich and a mushroom and cream cheese on a crisp baguette.  The winner was absolutely the mushroom and cream cheese choice.  It was amazing and I definitely could have eaten ten of those!  

There were two scone choices of blueberry/peach and lemon/lemon ginger.  Those were actually surprisingly tiny.  I thought they were both moist and fresh, but I would have loved them to be a bit bigger because they were so good and I love to slather clotted cream on them!   Oh, and there was also fresh fruit.  Which is great and all, but more scone please!

The last tier was the desserts.  Forgive me for not being accurate enough, but there was a delicious chocolate piece, cheesecake with lemon curd and blueberries.  Loved the chocolate, but I like my cheesecake plain.  While it was good it wasn't life changing.  BUT, the coconut macaroon was honestly thee best macaroon I had EVER had.  Again, ten of those in my possession would have been scarfed down in like 5 seconds.  I would buy a batch of those if I could!  Seriously, can I??

I can't wait to bring my mom here, total mom place fo sho!  But I also love it for myself too!  Or for a bridal shower... If I could do another one (since I'm married I don't think that's proper).  But it's a great place, that's what I'm trying to say and I'll for sure be back to get my proper English lady on!"
"PA","I met a friend for high tea on a weekday so we were the only ones there which we didn't mind at all given that we both brought our two year old children. We were served by Chef Jackie who I found to be friendly and informative. I was very impressed with the large selection of tea that included both loose and bagged options. We were told we could try as many as we wanted. 

I must admit I was a little disappointed with the quantity of sandwiches given. We were served an egg salad sandwich, a ham with avocado, and a take on a BLT which was bacon, tomato, and julienned spinach on top served on a piece of French bread. I wanted more. The second plate had fresh fruit and two scones- citrus and vanilla cream. Both were delicious but small in size. The final plate had a brownie, sponge cake, and small cupcake. Everything was delicious but I would have rather have had another sandwich or two over the last plate and larger scones. All of this cost $21pp."
"PA","Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).

We were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!

Then, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  

Oh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! 

I've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!"
"PA","Pittsburgh has a Four Seasons!

From Paris to Shanghai, London to Bangkok, the care with which this little B&B operation is run in Pittsburgh exceeds the best that I have experienced in any of these cities.

It may not have the conference facilities of a larger hotel, the business center, or in-house spa, but as a B&B, this is about as good as it gets. 

The structure in which the whole thing is held (do we call it a 'house'?) is old (perhaps we could say it generically to be 'victorian') with decor to match. These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have. The TVs aren't even old flat screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane.

Where this place really shines is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delays?

They make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs. I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant.

There is no elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others. You are in a city and on a reasonably busy street, so don't expect the charming home to be continued into a surrounding yard (although they do have an attractive new deck out back)."
"PA","Without a doubt one of the nicest places I have ever had the pleasure of laying my head...

...having wine and cheese...

....or breakfasting.

The Inn on Negley is gorgeously appointed.  The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular.  We were in the lovely Northern Spy.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious.  L'Occitane bath products smelled divine.  The Shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings.

Breakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure pleasure.  Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room.  The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee.  Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs.  Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery.  Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious.  Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  

Afternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.  Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room.  

Staff is not only eminently professional, but warm and gracious.  Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at Soba).  If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh, lodgings can't get much better than the Inn on Negley.

That's probably sufficient gushing."
"PA","This place is closed. It used to be one of my favorites, but is now occupied by Spin - a high-end gay bar (glad it at least turned into gay bar if Havana was going to go out of biz)."
"PA","I hope this place is still open!  It was cool, until they got the Touch Screen game at the bar.  There were great times at this place back in the day...  The mojitos were great, the Ricos awesome, and the stoli V and ginger rocked!  This is the 2nd bar I ever got into a fight with someone, an ex and I had a screaming match in the garden...  We're friends now, but I'll always remember that fight in the garden!"
"PA","Didn't havana go out of biz? I think this is the place with the purple awning. If not, oops! This place is OK. It does have a swanky feel and the martini's are OK but overall it is nothing special. Usually the place is very empty compared to the other bars on Ellsworth."
"PA","I have been here a few times and always find something new to try. The staff are a delight and I have great back and forth banter with the elder gentleman who is usually at the counter. 

My latest visit here was to get supplies for a friends Hot Pot night. Both of the staff were incredibly helpful with my questions. They directed me towards the best cuts of meat (I knew thin cut beef and pork worked well but not the specific type - i.e. fatty or lean). There was a great selection and variety of fresh vegetables which were well priced. Self control with respect to the assortment of red bean paste-based sweets was difficult but I managed!"
"PA","This Japanese food store has a nice selection of East Asian goods which are tougher to find in the East End. For example, I was able to find sushi grade fish, seaweed sheets, uni, pickled carrots, and green tea ice cream.

Unfortunately, I left the store empty handed because they did not have ice prepared to pack the fish in so that the fish would remain at a safe temperature during my trip home."
"PA","I was looking for something Japanese around me but had no luck until I came across this place, the prices are fair. I don't understand why people are complaining about the price, it's coming from japan! Of course it will be more than the American junk candy. The food is very fresh and extremely good for the price, I bought a big list of stuff and I would buy out the entire store if I had the money. They are very kind and nice, polite and funny. They are willing to help you out and they give you a nice verity of food and items for a little shop they are. I would highly suggest going there, the food is healthier for you and isn't much more than our typical everyday food. They have certainly got me wanting to go back for more."
"PA","It should be a 3.5. The bento box is tasty and they offered 10% off until the end of the year. But we were there around 2:00 pm. There were not a lot of selections for bento boxes. Maybe we should go earlier next time."
"PA","Slightly pricey compared to what those things usually cot in the west past. But it is in the burgh so stop by if you really want some authentic ramen, instant miso soup or even the bento( lunch) made by the oner!"
"PA","This place has a great selection of imported Japanese stuff. Mainly food, but some kitchen stuff and DVDs. Fresh sushi every day too. Just don't expect much English. The people do speak it fairly well though."
"PA","Wow. I just recently learned of this store from a good friend, and must say I have no idea why I hadn't heard of it before! I love asian food, and have been looking for the ideal market to stock up with things you just can't get from Whole Foods and Giant Eagle.

The quality of the items here is unmistakably superior. I love the fresh shiso leaves that I can get here; I love the wide variety of japanese mushrooms and produce they stock! Because of this market, I have been able to delve deeper into the wonderful world of the Japanese one pot meal I so love, and have been busily trying new recipes over the past several months. 

I haven't yet purchased their sushi grade fish, but it certainly looked fresh and I will certainly buy it from their market the next time I feel adventurous enough to make sushi at home...

My wife says I am addicted to having a lot of obscure Japanese condiments around the house, and after looking in the refrigerator the last time we visited Tokyo Japanese Food Store, I absolutely agree - Arigato gozaimasu!"
"PA","""Sugoi! Suki! Hontou!"" (Wow! Love it! Really!)

Just a few of the cute little responses the cashier exclaimed as she rang my items up (I'd like to thank anime for my informal understanding of the Japanese language). 

Tokyo Japanese is one of the most comprehensive Japanese groceries I've been to. Sure there are other Asian groceries where you'll find common items like soy sauce and pocky sticks, but when it comes to rare Japanese cooking staples, look no further. I loaded up on shiratamako, fukujinzuke, natto, okonomiyaki sauce, okonomiyaki flour, takoyaki flour, shimeji mushrooms, tenkasu, yakisoba noodles, and more. They also have sushi grade fish, produce, bento boxes, and baked goods -- all fresh. I couldn't not find anything if I tried.

The staff is very pleasant and friendly. Some items can be pricey, but they are the harder to find items that justify the cost. 

Tokyo Japanese is as sugoi as it gets, so they get 4.5 stars rounded up."
"PA","The bento lunches made by the owners at Tokyo Japanese Food Store are the bomb!! They satisfy any Japanese food craving that I might have. They typically either have something fried or grilled along with a small salad, rice and some other tiny sides, which can be found in the fridge in the back of the store.

If you want to make any type of Japanese food this store would have anything that you would need though a little pricey. However their fresh fish is out of the world if you want to make your own sushi or sashimi. I also bought the largest carrot that I have ever seen (for under a buck!) to go with a cold soba noodle dish that I was making. 

You won't regret popping in here as the owners take pride in their shop and keep it clean and all food fresh though note there is a $10 minimum for credit card."
"PA","Very expensive and small but organized and clean store, but it's got all my fav foods so I come all the time to stock up my pantry. Get the various ramen noodles, steamed japanese cheese cake, bento to go, lots of green tea and they even have some great japanese shampoo and conditioner if you ever need them. Right next to a laundry place, parking is almost always available in that little plaza. Come check it out!"
"PA","You'll probably find more variety in Asian groceries in the Strip district. But Tokyo Japanese food store supplies things that even Bai He (lotus) doesn't and is closer to the universities. 

There's an aisle dedicated to ramen. There's a shelf dedicated to cute drinks like ramune, green tea, calpico, and pocari sweat. There's also a shelf with bowls and cups which might make a nice present if thats what you go for.

They have fresh shiso leaf, frozen sushi fish, and specialty vegetables that you would find in Japanese cuisine such as lotus root. They also have half a cooler section with different types of miso. I like to get a red miso and a white miso. You can get actual asian tofu instead of the american (very firm) kind. By the cashier, you can get buns and breads from an Asian bakery. It's not particularly fresh, but if you're missing the taste you might want to try it.

I'm pretty sure there's a ramp for a wheel chair. The aisles though are pretty narrow so be careful."
"PA","This is a pricey Japanese grocery store with a wide variety of goods.  I know it better as our Saturday go-to place for BENTO BOXES.  Oh yes, they are so good.  They are made fresh daily by the nice Japanese mom and pop that own the place.  They make sushi as well and it is expensive but it really does taste a million times better than the Giant Eagle stuff.  They also sell SASHIMI grade fish so we tried our hand at sashimi cutting one afternoon as well."
"PA","I love this little grocer. They prepare little bentos (perfect for lunch while you do your laundry) and have a ton of niche items you can't get anywhere else. Plus, the produce and seafood is some of the best in the city. If you haven't found this place, then stay away, I don't want my selection lessening."
"PA","Tokyo Japanese Food Store is the only Japanese grocery in the area with a nice selection of produce, fish and processed foods.  Not all, but many things are overpriced, and I would check out Lotus (Asian market) in the strip district for certain items such as sauces, noodles, etc.

They are known to sell things past expiration dates: sometimes in the form as a ""sale"" without explicitly notifying the customer of the condition.  Now, I don't have a problem with buying slightly expired non-perishable (boxed, canned) foods for less... but I expect an honest business.

Many of their raw fish look discolored and old, making me ponder the honesty of the packaging dates...

In the end, many of the Japanese items can only be attained here, in Pittsburgh - having a small, but formidable selection to suit your needs.   I would just be weary with expiration dates and the perishables they sell."
"PA","If you're looking for Seafood City, 99 Ranch Store or some other all-Asian megamarket, this isn't the place.   After tracking the place down, my first look at the outside was kind of disappointing, because I was hoping for something larger.

But when I went in, I was glad to have made the trip.

What you will find when you go through the door is a neighborhood grocery store, primarily specializing in Japanese food.  It is not a large place, but is well-stocked, clean, and fresh-smelling.  They clearly take pride in their establishment. 

The staff is pleasant, and they have a good selection of products and brands.  Even brands seen in American stores were labelled in Kanji.

They do well with their limited space -- instead of putting a whole case of each product on the shelf, they put enough of each for you to find (or, of course, you can ask).  This lets them carry a far greater variety than you would guess from the size of the place, especially of candy and snacks (Morinaga and Pocky fans will find a wide selection).  Hi-Chew is $1.19 per pack (May 2011) in the various flavors, below the price I've found in Asian stores on the West Coast.

It seems that they are able to keep prices low by volume of sales, judging by the number of customers (about half a dozen in the few minutes that I was there).

The parking lot is small, and shared with a laundromat and another store or two.  There is on-street parking."
"PA","This is a wonderful place with very friendly people.  They stock a number of items that are not easy to find elsewhere and most importantly, have absolutely the best fish anywhere in the city if you want to make sushi or sashimi--my opinion not scientifically tested.  The prices are not low for this fish, but the quality is really brilliant.  You can get salmon that is super dense, with no muscular separation.  I have been told, but have absolutely no evidence or sources to refer to that the folks at Tokyo and at UMI (the big Burrito group sushi place right next door) source from the same place.  In any case, it is the only place I have found (and perhaps there are others--but none within walking distance--) that I would use to purchase fish for completely raw preparations."
"PA","Tokyo is a great place to get some hard to find japanese ingredients. The bento boxes are delicious and inexpensive.  Store is clean and the workers are very friendly.  They have a good selection of things that are difficult to find in the city like yuzu and ginko nuts and fresh shiso leaves, lotus root etc.  They also have a good supply of sushi grade fish, gindara, kimche and other picked items like plums.  Very good.  it also happens to be right across the street from Umi which I can also say has excellent sit down food. Try the omekasi, you wont be dissapointed."
"PA","I visited Japan for a month and this store reminds me so much of a true Japanese grocery store that nostalgia hits me every time I enter.

Unlike most Asian grocery stores (I'm looking at you, Strip District) Tokyo is VERY clean and has really fresh produce and meat. Every time I walk into Lotus Foods in the Strip I'm hit with a certain smell and it's always so dusty. It's awesome to be able to go to a grocery store that's small enough to keep their stock fresh. I also really appreciate how dedicated they are in keeping their store as Japanese as possible.

They stock the staples in Japanese beverages and snack foods as well. It's so hard to find Pocari Sweat and other soft drinks in Pittsburgh that you'd find in any vending machine in Japan but Tokyo stocks it in a variety of bottles; chilled or room temp. I always buy a big bottle of Pocari Sweat when I visit to put in the fridge. If you've never had it, it's a sports drink that has a hint of grapefruit. The grapefruit is so subtle that there is almost no aftertaste. It's almost like water but not sickeningly sweet like flavored water in the US.

They also have prepared foods available by an in-house chef. They come in the form of bento boxed lunches that have sushi and tempura and, while I haven't had one yet (some day I'll remember to go before I eat), they look delicious and fresh and are packaged in an appetizing way.
If you're Japanese and have never heard of this place you should definitely check it out. It's an incredibly authentic grocery store and just as clean as one found in Japan. If you're an American and are a bit jaded about Asian grocery stores because of the dirtiness and grumpiness found in many of the ones in Pittsburgh definitely check Tokyo out, it's incredible.

UPDATE: It took me until just a few weeks ago to try out their bento lunches. They're healthy and delicious. They'll heat the bento up for you on premises if you're eating on the go. The owner of Tokyo has also recently started selling his bentos and sushi in Lotus Foods in the Strip. Give them a try for a quick, healthy lunch."
"PA","I am in the service industry and my friends and I came here for my birthday. It was the worst experience and the bartender wouldn't give us lemons or limes for our drinks. She was rude and all over the place. We would have spent a lot of money but she deterred us from that."
"PA","This bar smells like a smoky urinal cake, all the time.

I only go in to buy six packs.  The bar staff seems nice enough.  It def seems like a frat crowd.

They get 2 stars only bc there is a skee ball machine."
"PA","Great place to go. Friday and Saturdays are busy. Good prices for shady side."
"PA","One of the few bars, seemingly, in America where people can smoke inside.  It's a fun place - darts and KARAOKE!  Just be warned that this place can get smokey.  Not a place to hang all night... stop in a grab a beer before hitting other places on Ellsworth."
"PA","Many a memorable (albeit fuzzily so) night at this bar when I was in PGH knocking on doors for the Obama campaign.  I'm convinced."
"PA","I like coming here with a group of people. I think this place may be able to claim they have the cheapest prices in Shadyside. Although many have said that this is pretty much a 'meathead' joint/sausage fest, I think the same could be said of other shadyside bars (william penn, doc's, etc.) 

I give the saloon four stars because it's near my house, has cheap drinks, and plenty of space. Usually dead on the weekdays."
"PA","to me this is my favorite grocery store in pittsburgh. plus shopping there gets ya discounts on fuel which helps alot nowadays. from flowers to fresh sushi it has it all. a good meat selection with a ton of variety in the case. olive bar. fresh fish .a ton of vegetables .huge selections of cheeses and prepared foods as well.not to many people there at night time makes it easier to shop quickly but also means all of the departments with cases are closed. free samples most days as well and a chef that cooks up something and has the recipe next to the food and you get to sample it.

all and all i love this giant eagle!"
"PA","I was scared to come into this Giant Eagle since the parking lot looked like a madhouse, but then I found an easy place to park in the garage, hopped in the giant elevator, and walked out the door and into a land of awesomeness.

My foodie boyfriend and I run into a problem all the time - we use both specialty ingredients like unique meats, cheeses, and produce, Asian ingredients, things like that...and we also want Tide, Bounty paper towels, Cheerios, cheap Barilla pasta, that kind of thing.  And up until now, I hadn't found a place where you could get both.

In that sense, this Giant Eagle Market district is the bomb.  The bomb!!!  They had a huge bakery section, a surprisingly unique produce section (Thai chiles!  Kohlrabi!  Purple cauliflower!  Taro!  Jicama!), a fun gourmet cheese area that carried some very hard to find things (ricotta salata cheese in particular, I remember), a cured meats area where I FINALLY found Spanish chorizo after months of hunting, a little olive oil station where you can some pretty decent olive oil in a Giant Eagle jar for $5.99 and you can taste them first with bread and cheese, a huge Italian section, a decent Mexican and Asian selection, a butcher with some good cuts of meat (who chopped up some lamb shoulder into stew meat for us), a fish market area, some bulk spices at a good price, and lots of other fun delights.

AND they have all the normal, national brands.  How cool is that?

The normal stuff is as expensive as it is at regular Giant Eagles, and the fancy stuff is more reminiscent of Whole Foods prices.  Still, there are some good deals.  We still try to do as much of our shopping as possible at Trader Joe's, but if there's any special thing I need after a TJ's run, I might check this place out!"
"PA","Wow, this store has greatly improved since I've been gone.  In ten years, it's turned into quite a nice store.  The variety of merchandise is great, although coming from the Midwest, I need to adjust to the price of food being higher.  The cashiers have been pretty friendly as well."
"PA","Ugh! Today is dark, dank, and dreary! I woke up with a stuffy nose and in need of some hot soup. So out into the gloom I go! I shop here often so this review will probably be modified the next time I visit because I usually really like it here. 

Earlier in the week I stopped to pick up a salad and two vegetable panang curries. I like them for lunch when I work at the office. They are not the best ever but I like them because they are pretty spicy and fill me up. This time it was runny bland mushy rice with extra mushy veggies. I pretty much gagged when I attempted to lunch. 

Since today I was in need of hot foods I decided to take back these lunches. I don't know if anyone else returns things to grocery stores but $10 bucks is $10 bucks that would go towards my lunch today. Better they pay for the crappy food instead of letting it sit in my fridge while I watch it go bad with a grump face. I had my receipt and took it to customer service. 

The lady was not very nice about it and questioned "" is that normally packaged like that?"" to two other employees. The one guy said "" looks like she ate it and spit back out"" Seriously?! GROSS! Then she wanted me to go with her and talk to the hot foods department. I declined because I didn't want it!!  Plus I didn't feel great! What more to the story is there?  I won't ever get it again and the attitude towards me because I dared to return poor quality food was not needed."
"PA","Selection of specialty and regular items is quite good. BUT, the layout, checkout and parking lots are literally the worst clusterfuck I've seen outside of New Delhi. Not bad after hours but those hours are pretty narrow."
"PA","Gotta say, this particular location of Giant Eagle (Market District) was the best Giant Eagle I've been to. Impressive selection of cheeses. Decent international section (although, Wegmans always surprises me! I'm talking mainly Asian stuff.)  Also was the place I became addicted to redbox DVDs.

I always enjoyed the festive events they have going on once in a while. The one that I went to was in celebration of fall - they would decorate the store, even had some live musician near the doorway, give away samples of pie and cookies. Felt really nice to be welcomed into the store that way. 

The only bad thing I'd say about this Giant Eagle is the clusterfuck of a parking lot they have. It's right off of a fairly busy street right by an intersection. They do have a parking garage, but you still have to wait in a line to get there because you're waiting for other people to park/reverse out of their space in front of you."
"PA","If they actually actually kept the store stocked, this would be a 4 star review.  However, I fight the traffic, parking lot, people with baskets, elevator, and rest of the customers to get to the bulk spices, Mexican section & produce only to find 100% of the things I need not stocked. So incredibly frustrating!
  They do have a nice cheese section, bakery, prepared food section & juice bar."
"PA","The last time i was in Pgh Giant Eagle Market District  was known as the  Food Gallery.. 

Giant eagle market district is located at the corner of Negley and Centre ave. The outside parking lot is usually full. However you'll be able to find  additional parking in the garage located on the Claybourne side of the store. 
 
I was pleased with the store from an aesthetic stand point. The market district is  a step above the non market district Giant Eagles. This location offers a larger selection of  ethnic , organic foods. 

The employees are  little nicer but customer service is just ok. Not good or bad but ok. 

If you don't have a customer loyalty card you won't be able to take advantage of savings. Competitors also have loyalty cards but price markup appears to slightly more than what I would have payed at a comparable store.  
However I'd consider shopping here for speciality items or for convenience."
"PA","I'm not a resident of Pittsburgh, and I've only been here once, but this place replaced Wegman's in my heart shortly after I walked in.

I came here on a hungover Sunday morning, so seeing all of these delicious foods and having samples offered to me every few steps was heeeaaaven. They have tons of selection - a mix of specialty food and regular stuff you'd find at typical grocery stores. I spent way too much time deciding on tomato sauce because they had just about an entire side of an aisle dedicated to just that. I was really impressed by their bakery - I was salivating.

Every sales associate I spoke to was friendly and patient (even when I asked where I could find bread crumbs... which were by the bread). When I asked one man where I could get non-organic eggplant, he personally walked me over to them, even though he was busy unpacking boxes.Their produce was fresh and their organic stuff had 'organic' stickers all over them so you couldn't cheat/get cheated (now why doesn't anyone around here do that?). As a cheese lover, I was glad to see the entire corner of the store where they sell their specialty cheeses. 

The only thing I can complain about is the some of the other customers. Some were rude and most had snarls on their faces, which I can't understand because the people who worked there were so friendly."
"PA","As a new resident of Oakland, this Giant Eagle was a natural spot to choose for my first grocery shopping experiences in the 'Burgh.  Coming from Central PA, I have a soft spot in my heart for Wegmans.  It's the best grocery store I know, and I'm a little sad that they haven't worked their way into Pittsburgh. I know Giant Eagle well from growing up in Erie and having lots of family in Pittsburgh, though.

That being said, the Giant Eagle Market District on Centre is A-OK.  While it feels a bit cramped (aisles are a little narrow) and I could see parking being an issue on a busy afternoon, I have had two pretty good experiences picking up essentials.  For a grocery store on a pretty small geographic footprint, there is a lot of selection.  In addition to the organic and whole-food options that other reviewers have mentioned, there is also the usual choices of Giant Eagle brand products.  It's a store where you can get exotic, boutique items . . . but you can also pick up the usual suspects.  I'm sure they are keeping an eye on the Whole Foods a few blocks away and striving to be more accessible and affordable, while also drawing customers with more upscale tastes.

Staff members at this Giant Eagle really set the place apart.  I had two good interactions with employees today (one in the meat department, and one in the grocery area).  I've seen plenty of smiling faces and people being eager to help shoppers find things.  These are the touches that bumped this up to a 4-star review."
"PA","The parking lot is a clusterfuck.

The entrance to this location always smells like spoiled milk. 

They usually have everything except what I am looking for and/or I just can't find it because it is not placed with similar things. Like when I went looking for organic hot cocoa mix...a week later I found it, not with the other hot cocoa mixes, but very randomly on it's own display at the end of the Asian foods isle. Gnocci? Not with the frozen Italian things, but with the other frozen Italian things...

And then when I finally find that one item that I desperately wanted enough to look for it here, I face the crazy check out lines where one has plenty of time to analyze a disturbing cross-section of consumer society, at which point I often re-think my desire for the superfluous item in hand, set it down and swear to never return to this store again."
"PA","What's with the bitter reviews? I live in San Francisco, and even I miss Market District! It's one of the best grocery stores I've ever seen in a proper city. Folks from upstate NY like to boast about Wegmans, but you only get 6+ prepared food buffets if you have nearly infinite floor space. Giant Eagle: Market District makes great use of their limited space. My favorite things:

-charmingly confusing store layout
-happiest store employee I've EVER met -- the guy who hands out cookie samples is so enthusiastic
-polite cashiers
-walk-in cheese closet

Transportation is easy for CMU students (B shuttle stops here). It's also on several major bus lines because it's on Centre Ave. Unfortunately, parking is the worst ever. Turning left out of the parking area is a nightmare and takes upwards of 3-4 minutes. Trying to turn left onto Centre during rush hour? Forget it. No matter where you're going, just turn right and resign yourself to driving really far out of your way."
"PA","Drama, Drama, and More Drama.

This review is for the event planning/wedding cake departments only.  I actually like the rest of the store.

We had previously arranged for an appointment to talk with the cake department, but when we arrived, we were told that the cake decorator had left for the day without plans to return.   We were then shuttled to talk with the event planning department about cake pricing options.   The event planner was cold, and odd, and definitely not in a good mood.  (For brevity and to protect her anonymity, I'll call her stormy.)

Stormy then gave us a wedding cake catalog with decorating ideas and pricing.  This is a bit of an overstatement, actually, since they make it intentionally difficult to figure out the price, hiding charges in five or six components and not being clear about any of them.

I went to ask for help from stormy, but imagine my surprise when I found she was busy frantically scribbling a letter to Giant Eagle H.R. about how she absolutely can't get along with another person in her department and how they were always cold and frosty with each other and storming in and out of workplaces when they were around each other.  I didn't see the whole letter, but that was the gist of it.  As I was trying to ask a question, stormy excused herself and said she ""had to get something for us.""   She took the hand written letter away and came back a good while later, having delivered her letter but not with anything to help us with our search.

Eventually, a replacement cake decorator came to our table with samples (good cake, by the way.)  The replacement decorator apologized for the ""drama in the department,"" which I appreciated.  We asked her to help us decipher the pricing, and she gave us some quotes, but then stormy said those quotes were no good, and she would have to look them up in her book.  And then stormy herself became confused and couldn't figure out how much a particular cake would be, since they seem to have recently instituted a more expensive pricing structure.

Between the two employees, they weren't sure if filling was extra or not, and if it was extra, much it would cost.  Same with whether the cake structure could be modified, and if so, how much that would cost.  They weren't sure how many servings were in a particular cake, (which seems to have changed recently) and thus, how much it would actually cost.  

But the general gist is that the cakes are overpriced and about 40% more than local bakeries.   

The sad thing is that we really liked the cake there, and we would have liked to buy it from Giant Eagle.  But considering the ordering drama, we couldn't trust them to deliver a good wedding cake, so we ordered somewhere else."
"PA","one of these things is not like the others,
one of these things just doesn't belong,
can you tell me which giant eagle is not like the others
before I finish my song?

did you guess which giant eagle is not like the others?
did you guess with all your might?
If you guessed that this giant eagle is not like the others,
you know what... you're right
________________________

ok, i'm done reverting back to my childhood now (thanks cookie monster).  honestly, i was nervous to go here after two horrible experiences at other giant eagles in the area.  they were dumps.  but, this one, the giant eagle market district is a breed apart. fresh, local, organic, freshly baked goodness everywhere you look.  the store is huge, the staff helpful, and the food is fresh.  my only complaint... the parking."
"PA","Dude, the other reviewers were NOT kidding about the parking.  I'm not a big fan of carrying orange juice up hills in the rain, but I think it would be worth it to not have to attempt to park in that insane asylum known as the giant eagle parking lot.

Giant eagle pita chips lose to Trader Joe's.  They got groceries though, lots of groceries!  I like being able to buy marketplace hummus dip AND toilet paper.  This place might beat out trader joe's for me for regular grocery trips, when I have to buy like, lettuce, and shampoo."
"PA","This was my primary store when I was in Pittsburgh back in 2006 and it does have a lot of selection.  Also, the juice/coffee bar, although expensive, isn't bad.  I ended up getting 1 of the better smoothies I've had in a long time there.

As 1 of the other reviews state, you do need to have patience in this store because the parking lot is always busy and the garage is tight.  Also, the aisles are narrower than South Hills, so if you have someone looking at stuff for a long time, be prepared to wait also.  

One can do much worse than this store.  I've been to plenty of other stores out of state such as Kroger and Albertsons, and Giant Eagle does a better job in my opinion.  You also can't beat the Fuelperks."
"PA","This is my #1 grocery store, one of the nicest I have ever been to, and I can walk from my apartment.  Has many of the organic specialty items as Whole Foods, but also has the cheap stuff to boot.  Be careful, though, produce and organic/natural items can be more pricey than Whole Foods or Trader Joe's.

#1 rule:  bring loads of PATIENCE.  I am currently unemployed, and as such have visited this store at all hours on all days:  It is ALWAYS busy.  If you are driving, be mentally prepared not to find a spot in their parking lot or two levels of parking garage.  Aisles also seem a bit narrow, be prepared to get stuck behind slower people."
"PA","This is my main place for groceries since it is super close to my house, so I've had a variety of experiences here.  I think the trick is to go on a Saturday when you have a lot of time and patience, or be prepared for some delays if you go after work.  I have a few gripes and a few praises, but its easiest if I list it out by category, so here it goes:
Parking: Lot and parking garage (with elevator) - be prepared to fight over a spot on busy days, and wait a few minutes for an elevator if you go in the garage. 
Produce: Plentiful, and usually fresh and tasty, but prices are up there with whole foods - over $1 for an apple or a tomato, and almost $3 for an avocado.  
Prepared Foods: Mediocre tasting, decent variety.  Good looking salad bar as well.
Associates: Knowledgeable and helpful
Self Checkout/ Self Scanning:  I use both frequently and run into an issue about every other time I use either.  
General Products: I must agree with Barrientos M. review, because many times things I'm looking for are expired!  They have a large selection and it includes many specialty items, but in my opinion they are not organized very well.  
Store Layout: There is a reason they give you a map, this place is very confusing and large.  The specials placed in the aisles are HORRIBLE, they create backups and clusters and I've seen 'cart to heel' accidents; this place is too crowed for the layout."
"PA","The nicest full-range grocery I've ever seen.  With, well, a catch.  

It's the flagship store for the Giant Eagle chain, and they're strongly competing against the Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, both less than a mile away.  They stock a large number of quirky items you normally would only see at specialty stores, and the produce section is amazing.  The employees in the produce section are also amazing, as many of them can spout off a recipe for any particular item they sell, with a story and a smile.

That said, the traffic in and out of this place is pretty rough, and the prices on random items are much higher than you might expect, while the average price of items are actually pretty darn good.  Hummus is ridiculously expensive.  Juice is cheap.  Dunno.

Every time we go here, we come out highly stressed, which sucks.  The parking lot, traffic, and lines all make for a bad time, so I shop elsewhere unless I really need something that other places don't stock."
"PA","So I stumbled into this Giant Eagle Market District on my way home from Trader Joe's.  (Note: The only grumble I have with TJ is lack of everyday essentials and I was suprised to learn that TJ doesn't stock dry beans).  So I am headstrong about making lentil soup that day and instead of going to Whole Foods (see past review).

I have been to the South Hills GE Market District before.  I actually enjoy the experience of walking around HUGE stores that overwhelm me with variety and random things.  Thus is the experience of GE Market District.  You are in a full-service grocery store that caters to all income levels.  AND you get FUEL POINTS for wasabi-covered soy beans.  Fantastic!  They give you a map of the store, which is truly needed, because the variety and stock is endless.  The parking at the Shadyside GE is sort of hectic.  Making a left out of the parking lot is pretty difficult.  I enjoy these new Giant Eagle grocery-monopoly attempts."
"PA","I have lived in the Pennsylvania building for over 3 months now and I felt a need to counter act all these negative reviews I keep seeing on here.

Firstly when I called maintenance to fix anything I would always get a prompt response usually within 24 hours. I remember my mailbox lock needed changed and 2 hours later a maintenance man came up to check and order a new one. 

People say Mozart has came into their apartment unannounced but that hasn't happened to us yet and Pennsylvania doesn't have a law requiring management companies to notice tenants when they will be coming over. So if you want a company to respect that you'll have to leave the state.  

All the maintenance, management, and grounds keepers have been very polite and knowledgeable to my roommate and I.

Be sure to read all of the lease before signing. They have all the information in their leases."
"PA","Mozart Management - Georgian on Ellsworth - AWFUL BUILDING

I have maintained video proof of all my miserable experiences living in my unit on the first floor for almost three months so far, and have provided proof of a couple of them here:

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH8llYlRPz2Qm7ovPQWSlyA

This is the NOISIEST place I've ever lived, and I read ALL bad reviews posted about them previously, and what every single person before me wrote is completely and 100% accurate.  

Mozart Management rented me and apartment on the ground floor directly across from the Maintenance Room/Office.  I had no disclosure of this whatsoever when I signed my lease.  There is no sign on the door, no evidence that this is where I would be renting a unit, or I'd have never signed a lease for this.  

You will hear every single floor board in this building, whether it's above or beneath you.  The maintenance crew is helpful, they are NOISY and completely awful to live by.  Due to my location in the building, I hear them all day long, every single day, clearly from my unit because there is a lack of insulation.  

They are often heckling and telling personal stories down the hall to one another, and I almost feel like I know more about their personal lives than I do of my own.  I don't even understand how they have the time for this.  The phone in the office rings all day long (also sounds like it's coming from my apartment, that's how loud it is) and I also get to hear every conversation made through walkie-talkies.  Every single day I hear the same man coughing and blowing his nose in the office as if he were sitting on my sofa doing it.  It's absolutely disgusting, and you get no peace whatsoever.

Also, my apartment unit sounds like a construction unit on any given day.  On the other side of the hallways, something else I was never informed of, is some sort of tool room.  I often hear saws, drills, vaccuums, you name it.  All day long.

Mozart has made an effort to calm the crew down for inappropriate content, but it's still not enough for my unfortunate apartment location.  My family and I did our research about this matter and it really is up to a rental company to first and foremost to provide a tenant with a peaceful and safe environment.  I never feel at peace here, and as a single female living solo, I am feeling less and less safe as I've become aware of having to share such close quarters with older men every single day that I do not know.  We asked kindly to be released from this lease, but Mozart feels they should be compensated from ME, even though they were creeps about disclosing the truth about this apartment.  Now, I am stuck due to the heavy fees it would cost. 


I REALLY wanted to like Mozart despite all of the bad reviews.  I'm truly not out to get anyone with writing a negative review.  But what the other renters have said IS true; Mozart's SOLE concern is about money, not the comfort or satisfaction of their customers.  They are untrustworthy, know they are untrustworthy, and are completely comfortable with being unethical.

For the amount of rent paid here (I pay $860 a month for a 1-bed), I've learned you can find a similar, possibly even lower deal, right around the same area in a much more peaceful building."
"PA","They just broke into my house without any notice to show around. They knocked so violently I almost mistaked it for gunfire. Then, before I was able to say anything, they broke in. There was at most 2 seconds interval between the knock and the break in. I wasn't dressed, and the guy just said ""Oh hi, we're showing the apartment"", and stormed into my kitchen. Ridiculous. I started ranting as soon as they left the room. This is totally invasive and disrespectful. I didn't read their lease very carefully when I moved in and I totally regret it (they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day, so I thought whatever, how bad could it be?). Apparently, breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here, and if you don't comply, they'll fine you as much as your unit's monthly rent (around $1000 for telling them no you can't enter the house). I've heard of several cases like this. They're unbelievably hostile and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible."
"PA","This is a total hidden gem. I was unaware that this bar existed till a friend took me here. We were sitting across the street at Mario's and he says to me, ""You want to go some place else and get some STRONG drinks?"" This proposition not only got me excited, but piqued my interest. Where are we going and why don't I know about this place?

Once we made it inside and up the long set of stairs (I can see myself taking a digger down these after a few Manhattens) you enter the dark, semi smokey bar. This place is divey but not dirty. It just looks they decorated it about 25 years ago and if it was good enough then, damnit its good enough now. The juke box is loaded with classic jazz and blues and normally operates at the guidance of the bartender (which is fine by me, he has good taste.)

The bartender is one of those guys whose career has been behind the bar. He makes his drinks fast, tall, and strong. The average cocktail (whiskey and coke, vodka and juice, gin and tonic) run about $6 and some of their others (Manhattan, martinis, etc) cost $8. The prices are higher than some may be used to, but relax, its worth it. You are getting a rocks glass with little ice, filled nearly to the top with your booze of choice, and a mist of whatever else you wanted to water down the drink. If I'm going to spend $15 in a bar I would rather drink 2 well made, strong drinks than drink 15 cups of coke each with an eye dropper's worth whiskey.  

If you want a place to listen to some good music, get schwacked on liquor, and enjoy some conversation, Mardi Gras is you joint."
"PA","When damaging your liver it's best to use only the freshest and best quality ingredients and if you want to do some serious damage then you should definitely check out Mardi Gras.  

They freshly squeeze the oranges and grapefruits in front of you for your Screwdrivers and Greyhounds so you don't have to worry about nasty impurities from the fruit juice ruining your cocktail.  Why make your liver work harder than it already has to."
"PA","Good luck getting out
With your soul and belongings.
Bring your own flashlight.


(b)"
"PA","Weird mix of local drunks and school crowd. Drink specials were nice. Had a pint of Brooklyn stout that was only $2.50. Pretty good deal compared to the Miller Light only type specials in other local bars. No tabs or credit cards, though. Isn't it 2010?"
"PA","I lived across the street from Mardi Gras for a year.  It was a pleasure I can't begin to describe."
"PA","""Alright you bunch of booze bags, go home.""  I would probably end up staying for days on end if I wasn't told that at the end of the night.

Great Drinks
Great Juke box
Great Crowd
and, wait for it........ a mrs. packman machine."
"PA","My personal favorite Pittsburgh bar. Notorious for fresh juice and strong drinks. For the first few years I lived in pgh this was our standard last stop before heading home. Not once did I remember leaving the bar. Things have slowed down a bit since then, mostly because I've also learned to never order more then two drinks. It's also tiny, so if you want to sit down, get there early (or go during the week). Weekend crowds are ass to crotch throughout the entire place."
"PA","Finally came back after 2+ years away. Brose was there, Richie had a strong drink waiting, McGovern was manning his spot by the juicer...so, nothing had changed. It was a joy to be back, talking to Brose and listening to good blues on the jukebox. I can't say enough about how great the Mardi Gras is."
"PA","Quite a cool spot and pretty underrated, at least in my social circle. These drinks are slightly more expensive than some may be used to (I got a simple whiskey and coke, which set me back around $7) but as others said, they are definitely strong. The ambiance is very relaxed, with a lounge feel if you sit in the booths. It is smoky, but I went on a Friday night around 9pm and it wasn't so bad. It certainly didn't leave me reeking of smoke like other spots in the city. Also, compared to the crowds in other places that night, the atmosphere was downright sedate, so if you're looking to relax, this would be a better option. 

The only thing is that they only deal in cash. There's an ATM there, but you're better off bringing money so you don't have to deal with the surcharge."
"PA","Super super strong drinks. Very smoky and small, but definitely worth coming to."
"PA","I moved to California ~2 years ago and miss Mardi Gras more than anything else. Richie and crew provided a home for all, the writers, designers, storytellers and more who found ourselves adrift and looking to share our story. Can't wait to get back one day."
"PA","If someone has not heard of Le Mardi Gras, I just assume they aren't well versed in Pittsburgh drinking culture. This is one of the best bars in the city. Their drinks are remarkably strong, easily on par with Lefty's in the Strip. As a matter of fact, I really don't recommend having more than four or five Mardi Gras cocktails. They will kick your ass.

This is one of the only bars in the city where I will walk in and just tell the bartender to make whatever whiskey drink he feels like making. I realize this might not sound like a big deal, but I have serious trust issues when it comes to bars. There are only about twenty six bars worldwide where I will even consider ordering  a Manhattan or a Martini. 

One of the best kept Le Mardi Gras secrets is that on Sunday they offer free food to their patrons. Even though we visited on a Thursday, the owner, Rich, was kind enough to put some food out for us. These little touches are what make Mardi Gras more than just a bar.

Here are some of my favorite Le Mardi Gras features: smoking, table top pacman, excellent juke box, fantastic bartenders, intimate seating, dark ominous ambiance and lively patrons. According to Le Mardi Gras' website they've also hosted a variety of celebrities including Rocky Marciano, Harvey Kietel, Sammy Koufax, Sam McDowell, Billy Conn, Alice Cooper, George Clooney, Russell Crowe and Ted Danson."
"PA","Pamela's crepe style pancakes contain six honks of butter, and they've been unrivaled in my quest for the perfect pancake. They're fluffy in the middle, get progressively crispy toward the edges, and are a great prelude to a Sunday afternoon nap. Man, if a former worker wants to sell me the recipe, I promise not to sell it to IHOP for several hundred million dollars. Please, you can trust me!"
"PA","We liked everything except the bacon. Another waiter recommended the ham for next time. If you like potatoes be sure to ask for extra crispy. The crepes were great come in a stack of three. I'd suggest getting one or two only. The fresh strawberry were great even though out of season. Definitely will eat here again."
"PA","Lovely warm place and nice staff. Beef corned potatoes are very good. I have been their twice and still want to go again. ONLY CASH IS ACCEPTED"
"PA","We kept it simple: hotcakes, eggs, and sausage. Everything was cooked properly and was tasty in its simplicity. I'm not a big pancake fan, but these hotcakes were really good. The edges had a caramelized crisp, and the rest of the cake was thin and not overly cakey. It was a really good breakfast."
"PA","I always love love love the food here,  but seriously dislike the coffee,  and I'm usually pretty easy going with coffee."
"PA","Deliciously hearty breakfast foods served up diner style. Service and turnover is quick so you never have to wait too long. The crepe style pancakes are a must have. Anything with their signature potatoes is a must have. Juices are not fresh squeezed, FYI."
"PA","Midmorning on a Sunday, we had to wait about fifteen minutes for a table for 5. The kids had pancakes and waffles. The teenager nearly passed out from happiness over the chocolate chip waffle. The three year old had to closely protect his pancake because his mother and I kept stealing bites whenever he let his guard down. I had a chorizo hash special. It wasn't spicy, but neither was it underspiced and I enjoyed it to the last bite.

It wasn't diner prices, but I felt like it was fair.

While we waited, we stood over vent outside Prantl's to stay warm and enjoy the bakery aroma."
"PA","The food was generally good. Made the mistake of going during the lunch rush so the wait was a little bit longer than what I expect is normal. Ordered the chorizo and eggs; the chorizo itself was a little crispy, and burned for my taste but was still good. Looking forward to trying out the famous hotcakes at another point. Definitely recommend Pamela's for a brunch or breakfast in general."
"PA","Pamela's is a staple and a classic to the Pittsburgh region. I've eaten at 3 locations: Oakland, Shadyside, and the Strip District. There's usually a line and no reservations, and they only take cash. I usually get the banana chocolate chip hotcakes, and sometimes will get just the chocolate chip hotcakes with whipped cream which are both equally delicious! The service is good as well, as they bring you waters the moment you sit down, and ultimately they are trying to get tables their food and ultimately get new customers in the door."
"PA","Good food, cooked well, came out hot. Service was also very good. Waitress came back to top off coffees more than once. Prices also good, but cash only. Wouldn't wait if a really long line, but definitely would go early to get a better than average breakfast out."
"PA","Recommend by several senior student of mine in CMU, finally I came here today for my dear friends birthday. Food in here really amazing and served very fast. Associates in Pamela's also very kind and sweet. But they only receive cash no credit card such a pity.  Love this dinning experience and will come back very soon :D"
"PA","Came here based on the reviews and OMG Pamela's did not disappoint! In a cute quaint area with nice shops all around & is a retro but contemporary feeling decor.  and the food was the BOMB.COM with super fast, friendly service."
"PA","It was just OK for me. A cash only establishment that gets very busy, I just wanted a no thrills sort of pancakes and eggs breakfast, and for that it delivered. Service was a bit slow, but the big portions made up for it...almost too big...IS there such a thing? I had the pancakes that are sort of mixed with a crepe, they were huge and not too bad. My egg was quite overdone however, but the sausages were good. Prices are on point, just not really a place I could see coming back to all the time, especially with the crowds."
"PA","My friend suggested going to Pamela's for brunch when I was visiting by saying ""Obama comes here when he's in town"", so I was obviously game since hey, if it's good enough for the President... There was a bit of a wait when we arrived at 10:30, which is to be expected on the weekends. When we were finally seated in about half an hour, we decided to share the chocolate chip banana hotcakes, Gail's Famous Eggs, and a side of bacon. I also ordered a small orange juice, which I would recommend steering clear from. A small cup is big enough for a 3 year old and the orange juice tasted like 80% tap water, 20% orange juice concentrate. 

The food came out really fast, which was great since we were starving after waiting for a bit to be seated. I thought both plates were really delicious! The hot cakes were definitely a mix of a crepe and a pancake since the edges are thin and crispy and the middle was thicker and softer. Loved the bananas, chocolate chips, and whipped cream filling and really appreciated that they split the dish onto 2 plates for us. The eggs were also really good, but I wish the cream cheese was softer since it was difficult to spread on the eggs. We requested extra crispy Lyonnaise potatoes, which I would highly recommend since I prefer crispy potatoes to mushy ones. I would not recommend ordering the bacon unless you just want a bacon taste in your mouth since the bacon is paper thin, greasy, and not very satisfying.

Overall, I thought everything was really tasty and a great spot for breakfast/brunch, especially if you have any visiting friends or family!"
"PA","Pamela's is the hottest thing in Pittsburgh, and they have lines of an hour long, going out the door, they don't take reservations, But I'm not sure why they have such high ratings. After waiting for an hour to get seated, we were expecting good food, and in reality, everything was drenched in butter. Everything was super greasy, buttery. Even their hotcakes (which are like crepes - love crepes) they look great, but once you taste them, it's all butter. Our party also tried the French toast and hash browns and those were super greasy too and didn't taste good at all. The reason it's so busy is because it's the only show in town. There are a few of them and there's really nowhere else to go. It's sad. Being from NJ and having many diners that compete with each other, there are some good tasting Diners making good French toast, crepes and hash browns. This was just a joke and DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE WAIT. The service on the other hand, was very good and workers were very nice and helpful."
"PA","Maybe ""yinzer good"" isn't always such a bad thing. I went here the other morning and was quoted a 25-30 minutes wait time. It took 50 minutes. That seemed to be pretty standard so be prepared for that. Once we got in and ordered, the food came out almost immediately making the wait time more worth it. The hot cakes were delicious but be prepared for more buttery goodness than one should consume in a month. The potatoes were also half butter. I thought they tasted great if not a tad salty. The orange juice is more affordable than in most breakfast places but it wasn't mind blowing, I doubt it was fresh squeezed. My husband ordered eggs and hash which were also good but overly salty. We left feeling stuffed, guilty, and knowing that while the food was tasty our waistlines could only handle eating there once every couple of months."
"PA","Pamela's is a classic brunch staple in Pittsburgh. I have many memories here from my college days, and it always brings back great memories when I dine here. After traveling around a bit and living in NYC, I admit I have been spoiled. In college, Pamela's was the best brunch thing to me, but now I've gotten pickier. 

The hot cakes are great as everyone had mentioned. It's a cross between a pancake and a crepe, but leans more towards the latter. I got the Banana Walnut Hotcake, and it definitely hit the spot. I also tried the Tex Mex Omelette, which was tasty as well. It had a little bit of heat, and the side potatoes were good too.

Overall, a solid, safe bet for brunch. Be sure to get there early, as the dining room fills up quickly. Cash only (PNC ATM is across the street)."
"PA","We had to wait quite a bit for a table but once we got seated the food came out pretty fast. My friend and I ordered the chocolate chip banana hotcakes and Gail's famous eggs to share. The hotcakes were good as usual but I think it's over hyped. I didn't really like the eggs at all. It was creamier but it had this weird taste to it that I didn't like. We also got a side of bacon which was eh. We asked for the potatoes to be extra crispy and that definitely makes them so much better!"
"PA","3rd time I've eaten here and can't wait to return. The best reason to visit Pittsburgh.   We had Blueberry,  Banana Walnut,  and Banana Chocolate Chip Hotcakes.  Each was excellent, but LOVE the Banana Chocolate Chip.  Service was efficient, but not rushed."
"PA","There are 2 types of ""Good"" restaurants in Pittsburgh. There is Yinzer good and Actually good. This food is Yinzer good. Way too much butter and sugar. Yuck."
"PA","This restaurant has quality food in a great neighborhood."
"PA","We go to Pittsburgh maybe twice a year and we always try to go Pamela's every trip.  This place fills up very quickly and I remember often having to line up to get in.

One of the first things you will notice is that there is a photo of Obama at the cash register right out front.  

Some things to point out before I get to the food is that the washrooms are upstairs through the South American restaurant that shares the same building.  Another thing is that the tables do not move so there is no re-arranging for larger parties.  This place only accepts cash unless they've changed that from the last time I was there it's always been like this at least for this location.

The tables are small considering the amount of plates you will get when you order breakfast.  Really with the coffee and side plates of toast, hash, etc it will be a balancing act to get everything on one plate maybe...  So if you ordered side of sausage or whatever, if you can throw it on your main plate and stack all the side plates if possible.

Now to the food.  It's damn good period.  I mean breakfast is tough because you can really only twist it so many ways so what makes Pam's special?  The crepes and pancakes is what is unique if I had to pick something.  The crepes you can get will walnut and creme and whatever but they ultimately become humongous and if you had something else like bacon and eggs then you will have no room on your table and in your stomach (maybe) because the portions can be big.

I prefer plain pan cakes with butter and syrup and nothing else added myself... their pancakes... the edges are crispy and light but not too fluffy.  

We usually get a side of corned beef hash which is just awesome but wow I try not to think about how much sodium is in it especially since I always get bacon too.

The place has packed for a reason and they're not all tourists because Shadyside is a nice cozy neighborhood.  When locals pack a place consistently the reason is simple... the place is +++"
"PA","A great, independent eatery.  They have breakfasts of all description, freshly made and quite enormous, at reasonable prices.  Bring a big appetite.  Their omelots will fill you to bursting even if you don't eat the huge slices of bread and hash browns that come with them.  And,  hey, the coffee is good, too."
"PA","Absolutely delicious food, melt-in-your mouth lyonnaise potatoes and crepelike pancakes.  It's tiny, cheek-by-jowl and often a long line on the weekends, but worth the wait and the cash-only inconvenience.

I can't speak to anything but the breakfast food since I've never been able to get past it!

My husband and I who lived within walking distance (or waddling distance, when leaving to go home) would normally split a hotcake special with the ham and cheese omelet.  That way we each could get eggs, meat, pancake, and potato cravings fulfilled.  When I went without him, I would either get the breakfast special or the corned beef hash with a side of the hotcake, regular.  My favorite hotcake flavor was the banana and chocolate chip, but occasionally we would get the strawberry or blueberry - don't be afraid by the sour cream ingredient.  It tastes AMAZING, and not too rich. (any richer, with the buttery hotcakes it would be over the top and make it more like dessert than breakfast).

Their hot cocoa is probably from the package, but made decadent by the generous dollop of whipped cream that floats majestically on top.

I once sat next to Franco Harris at the next table.  If he and Obama eat their hearts out here, you'll do fine.  Come try it already!"
"PA","I had a wonderful breakfast at Pamela's. The food really is delicious, but quite expensive for breakfast! Our bill came to about $40 for 3 people. That's a lot of money for eggs and pancakes!!

We were a little overwhelmed when we first arrived because the waiting area was packed. They told us only 10-15 mins and it was spot-on, which we were pleasantly surprised about! Our server came to us right away. I could immediately see how fast-paced they work to keep their customers flowing on a busy morning!

Everyone in my group would agree that the best part of the meal was the lyonnaise potatoes. My friend recommended asking for the potatoes to be ""crispy"" and I'm glad I did. They were absolutely delicious. A crunchy coating on top with soft potatoes and onions underneath. YUM.

I ordered the Gail's eggs which were scrambled eggs topped with green onion and cream cheese. It came with a side of potatoes and two gigantic pieces of bread. The eggs were done perfectly and I although I had never had cream cheese on eggs before, it was delicious!! It's going to be hard to avoid cooking my eggs like that from now on! One of my friends ordered the breakfast special with 2 eggs, meat and a side of their specialty blueberry hotcakes. It falls somewhere between a crepe and a pancake. They cook a giant pancake and roll it up over a variety of fillings. It looks beautiful and tastes delicious! If it's too sweet to order for your whole meal, it's definitely worth ordering as a side for a few to split just to get a taste! My other friend ordered a daily special which was Chorizo hash served with eggs and tortillas. There was a surprising amount of meat and he was very pleased with his meal as well.

The food is great and I was happy to finally experience this Pittsburgh gem. Prepare to pay more than your typical diner, but you certainly won't be disappointed by the quality!"
"PA","Ok, I get it. Brunch is amazing. Sunday brunch is more amazing after a late night on Saturday. And I wholeheartedly agree that the food here is good- (how can you mess up brunch?). However, this branch on Shadyside is a nightmare to go to on the weekends. It takes FOREVER to get a table here every time. There are mounds of people that line up on Walnut Street to get a table. After spending the time outside, any food they offer you will sound amazing because your stomach is growling so loudly. Objectively, the food here is good and the dinner decor has a lot of character. However, I stopped going here a long time ago when I discovered that Harris Grill brunch is much more hearty and the wait will at least be half an hour less."
"PA","Oh my goodness I absolutely love this place! Strawberry hotcakes have brown sugar creme cheese and whipped cream! Also love the chorizo sausage with eggs n hash! Fresh strawberries year round wonderfully delicious !"
"PA","We heard that this place had amazing pancakes and was always extremely busy. We took our chances and arrived around 9:45am. It was open seating and we were easily able to find a table.

First off - you can only pay cash. That is a huge turn off, especially if you are out of town. Personally, I never carry cash and frankly I don't know many people who do. This place isn't worth going to an ATM for.

Several people at my table ordered the pancakes so I got french toast. It was incredible eggy. If you like that, then you will like these but I don't prefer to have a layer of egg on my french toast. I tried a friends hot cakes and they were okay. They are super thin and crispy on the outside. I prefer a thick fluffy pancake. :(

I also didn't love the service we received. The server came over with several plates and was extremely rude about us not speaking up enough about whose food was what even though we were telling her it was ours. I wanted a refill on my orange juice but the next time our waitress came around she gave us the bill - thanks!"
"PA","Today was my second time at a Pamela's. During my first trip I made the mistake of 1)not ordering hot cakes 2) dining alone 3)not ordering hotcakes! 

I was worried about a wait for a Sunday morning but it was surprisingly only 15minutes. We were seated & greeted promptly. Both of us ordered the morning after breakfast with the strawberry pancakes. The potatoes /home fries were awesome & as another reviewer mentioned it feels as if every bite is different (&fabulous). 

Speaking of fabulous, I'm thankful to have finally experienced the Pamelas hotcake. It was filled with fresh strawberries, sour cream, brown sugar bits.. & every bite was better than the last. Don't let that trio scare or fool you-.it's delicious 

Next weekend can't come fast enough to stop back

...forgot to mention it took no time at all for 4 giant plates of food to reach our table."
"PA","This place was great! We had several different dishes, but the chorizo hash was the winner. 

Expect a bit of a wait, but it's worth it."
"PA","Not the place for local, organic, grass-fed, gourmet riff-raff. Pamela's is known for stick-to-your-ribs diner food and they do it very well. Definitely my go-to for weekend brunch or hangover recovery in Pittsburgh. The Oakland location you'll find is often full of Pitt or Carnegie Mellon students, whereas the Squirrel Hill and Shadyside locations usually have a more yuppie-type clientele.

Pamela's hotcakes are a masterpiece. Never mind that they use pounds and pounds of butter for these hotcakes, you'll be hard-pressed to find pancakes/crepes as delicious as these. What's great is that they can be eaten alone in a savory manner, or piled with fruit and whipped cream and more butter for a sweeter breakfast experience. The lyonnaise potatoes are also something to marvel at. You can ask them to griddle the potatoes a little longer for a crispier taste, which I definitely recommend. 

The omelets are all pretty standard fare here, but they do them consistently well every time I've been. Best thing is that most combinations or menu items will only run you at about $8-10, with tip and tax about $13. Pretty awesome. Only downside is that it's cash only, but since there are a couple ATM's and a PNC nearby, it can be overlooked. 

Overall, come here for some of the best breakfast comfort food that Pittsburgh has to offer."
"PA","The food here is over the top excessively greasy. So greasy that it made me sick to my stomach before I was done eating my meal. My husband and I split the chocolate chip pancakes and a ham and cheese omelette with potatoes and toast on the side. Not only was everything in a pool of grease, but it seemed to be margarine...not even real butter. I will never eat here again. I am gagging even thinking about this meal let aloe eating it again."
"PA","Today's special, Rachel turkey wrap. Made w real juicy roasted turkey, slaw, and a very flavorful ""Russian sauce."""
"PA","I LOVE THIS PLACE! While I was a Fellow at Carnegie Mellon, I was introduced to this place and fell in love. OBAMA came here too! Cash only, and nearly anything you order off the menu is pure GOLD!.. well.. not literally gold because that'd be weird to eat.. but its REALLY good food!

Seriously. Don't even look. Just close your eyes, point at something, and order it. It's guaranteed to be de-lic-ious. I ordered almost everything off the menu during my summer here. I MISS IT! :'("
"PA","I have always enjoyed going here for breakfast/brunch. In my younger years, I would go for the hotcakes. So thin, large, and crispy on the edges. Yummmyyy.

I will write an update to this review...after I go to it again hopefully  next month...But if it is as good as I remember, you won't be sorry going here."
"PA","So many great reviews.  Friends who live or have lived in Pittsburgh rave about this place.  It was supposed to be THE PLACE for breakfast and brunch in this city.  I first visited this place on a short Pgh Apt hunting trip back in April 2013.  Went in, got excited, as the place was packed with people.  It had the classic diner feel.  It had to be good.  Sadly, it wasn't.  Not wanting to give up hope, I went back to Pamela's the next day, and went with the corned beef hash, since many yelpers had mentioned it.  Again, disappointed.  Having settled in Pgh for a few months now, I decided to give Pamela's a third chance recently.  *sigh.  I don't get how this place has such high yelp ratings.

Food = (6.5/10) = As mentioned above, my first visit I tried the western omelet.  It was just ok.  Not well seasoned, and the cheese was meh.   Quantity wise, you do get a huge amount of food for what you pay for.  Second trip was the corned beef hash trip.  Really don't understand what is so great about this dish.  My third trip I tried the tex-mex omelet.  Again, eggs under seasoned, and cheese was meh.  What bothered me the most was the ""guacamole.""  It's more like avocado paste with mayonnaise consistency.  Like something you would squeeze out of a toothpaste tube. Texture was not appealing.  The friend who came with me on this third trip ordered the pancakes, which he thought were fine.

Ambiance = (7.5/10) = it's got the classic diner feel, with diner friendly waitresses/waiters.  

Service (8.0/10) = as mentioned above, the classic diner friendly environment.

Overall opinion = I wonder if those who give high ratings to this establishment, are the locals of Pgh, and college/grad students on a budget and naturally appreciate the large quantities of food for cheap prices.  This place is just ok for me.  I'm still searching for my go-to-brunch place in Pittsburgh.  I do recommend trying this place out and making your own judgement, especially if you've just moved to the area.  There is always a wait to get in on weekends, so they must be doing something right.  Place is cash only."
"PA","Cash only.

The 'famous' corn beef hash was not great- and heavily salted.  

Eggs were good.

Not great food / not a lot of bang for the buck / 3.0 from me"
"PA","I've eaten at Pamela's several times, usually in the Strip location, but today in Shady Side.  I can honestly say that Pamela's is by far the best breakfast restaurant I have ever eaten at. Their ""crepe"" pancakes are awesome!  I Love how the outer edges of the pancake are crispy and buttery and the taste of the pancake itself is just fantastic. Their potatoes (lionized ?? Potatoes) are outstanding, and are the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  I would also strongly recommend their corned beef hash!  As other reviews has commented, be sure to bring cash, as it is cash only.  Also, if you plan to go, you may have to wait in line, as Pamela's in the Strip is typically pretty crowded, especially on weekends.  That said, this restaurant is totally worth the wait. I guarantee you will not be disappointed by any breakfast you order here.  Now if the owners would just open one up here where I live so I don't have to drive down into the city."
"PA","Great place for brunch. I love the breakfast specials"
"PA","Good hotcakes, eggs and omelettes were good and so is the potatoes and coffee. The side of bacon was less than small and the western omelette came with guacamole paste from a tube or something. I was looking for real guac from a place this popular. That being said it is a good breakfast place on the verge of great if they wanted to take it there. The hotcakes could be better and dont really compete, but this is a good place and you cant go wrong here. Corn beef hash is the real deal."
"PA","Great hotcakes. No so great wait.  The hotcakes are worth trying, but there are other places in Pittsburgh that have much shorter waits that I prefer."
"PA","Ok! The best hash I have ever had. Their potatoes are ""bananas!"""
"PA","O.M.G. I currently live in Cleveland and I have my favorite breakfast/brunch go to place here (called Coventry Inn). But after going to Pamela's, now I'm depressed that Cleveland doesn't have a brunch place as good as Pamela's! I am craving this spot!

Pamela's is your usual diner spot... place looks a bit homey, a bit dirty, and a bit...local. But that's when you know it's good right? It's got some real homemade cooking into it. If you don't want to listen to my suggestions on what to order, just (i beg you) make sure you order the CORN BEEF HASH. Here's my reviews below now:

Corn Beef Hash (5+): I don't know what they add in there, but that sh*t is delicious and addictive. I took one bite, and it was like my palette was ready for 5 more bowls of it. The corned beef in the hash is so good. They season the corned beef so well that it gives the whole dish this heavenly taste.

Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes (5): I think Pamela's called crepes hotcakes. This was just chocolate chip banana crepes. So naturally, it was delicious. The hotcakes was made really well, a bit crispy on the ends. and the melting chocolate with banana was just yummmmmmy.

Go to Pittsburgh, and you better stop at Pamela's. There might be a wait, but trust me, it's worth it. And it's cheap!"
"PA","The banana chocolate chip pancakes are the ultimate evolution of the pancake. Not since mankind first invented batter has their been a more revolutionary flavor experienced by a breakfast-seeking individual. These compliments are coming from someone who actively avoids breakfast and doesn't take pancakes very seriously. This endorsement could not come from a harsher critic of breakfast.

In other news, the corned beef hash is very good. The service is friendly and the space is nice. Protip: Go when they open to avoid the line because they fill up fast."
"PA","Not deserving of the rave reviews. Breakfast is cheap, and definitely very poor quality. Grease is the common theme in food, and though it might taste OK a first, your digestive tract may say otherwise later. 

The space was cramped, we sat almost elbow to elbow with other guests, with my back a foot from a brick wall. The waitresses were extremely fast, except for coffee refills. Almost felt rushed because the bill came so quick; probably had something to do with the busy line in the waiting room. And why, in this day and age, are you cash-only, Pamela?"
"PA","I was here at the Pamela's in Shadyside a few weeks ago - dining companion and I were looking for a nice brunch-y place to visit. Naturally, with all the high ratings we saw on Yelp! for Pamela's, we gave it a shot.

I have to ask: What is all the fuss about this place?

My companion and I were a little dismayed to see it was a cash-only place, but luckily in Shadyside there is a PNC just up the street. The restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables. It wasn't an uninviting atmosphere, more laid-back, but also a little indifferent, if that makes any sense. Our waitress wasn't unfriendly, but didn't really go out of her way to talk much with us.

After perusing the menu for a bit, the fella ordered a Greek salad with chicken while I went for the crepe-hotcake dish. Food came out pretty fast, but that was sadly the best part about it.

My companion's tiny salad was served in a large silver bowl, like the chef had mixed it up and decided better of putting it on an actual plate. The Greek dressing was saturated with lemon flavor, way too tart and sour, and the chicken was pretty paltry for the price.

My crepe-hotcake thingies were okay, but very oily and griddle-tasting. Way too rich to finish.

Overall, we found ourselves very underwhelmed with Pamela's. Our search for a good brunch place continues."
"PA","HOT CAKES.  That's really all I have to say.  I was wondering what the fuss was about, and when I took my first bite, it all made sense.  As for the rest of the breakfast items, they're okay.  I ordered corned beef hash, and it seemed like the kind of corned beef that came from a can.  I could be wrong, but it just didn't have much flavor.  The only annoying thing about this place is the wait.  Get there early or be prepared to wait, outside, for a long while."
"PA","We had a terrible breakfast here not long ago. Like many couples in the city, we love to go out every other week or so for a weekend breakfast. This day, it wasn't busy, and the speed of service was good. The French toast was an abomination. The toast had about a quarter inch of egg white formed around the edges, from poorly mixed batter. Plus the bread was poor quality. The bacon...crunchy fleks of the thinnest, most meager bacon these eyes have seen. The crepe pancakes were ok, but nothing to write home about. Years ago I worked for a grumpy penny pincher who had been swindled into buying a 3 year supply of prepackaged coffee, which just sat in our storeroom for years until we brewed it, and cursed it. Van roots, it was. Pamela's, in all the years I Have visited, has consistently challenged van rooy for the worst coffee crown. On top of all the bad food, last week Pamela's earned that crown. We'll be enjoying breakfast elsewhere in the future."
"PA","i think i'm in love. i had heard about pamela's before and that it's the best place for brunch, but i hadn't had a chance to go until yesterday.
i get inside and was not exactly blown away... small diner-style, cash only restaurant. but ok, at least it will probably be cheap right?
the menu looks pretty promising... interesting choices, breakfast and lunch, not a huge menu but not bad. i decide to go with the feta and spinach omelet (with the potatoes), and my friend that went with me went with the crepe hotcakes.
the food comes and i begin to dig in. bam. the magic occurs. the omelet was tasty and the potatoes were even tastier! i had a bite of my friend's hotcakes and was blown away.
moral of the story, don't judge a book by it's cover. the food entirely speaks for itself and makes this place a 5 star worthy breakfast joint."
"PA","Don't come here if you're looking for a healthy breakfast.

And definitely don't come here if you don't want to wait around, especially when the local schools are in session.

But DO come here for amazing hotcakes and the most glorious, buttery, greasy spoon breakfast around.  

The hotcakes, for those of you unfamiliar, are more like crepes.  Usually stuffed with fruit and whipped cream and fried in butter.  Extremely sweet and rich and the best ever cure for a college hangover.

Prices are cheap and the place is cash only.  Super friendly, quick service.  Always on my must-visit list when I'm back in town."
"PA","Pamela's is great.  The pancakes are crêpe-like, crispy on the edges, and still have a pancake flavor.  Sometimes though, the pancakes can be a little too greasy.  This place gets packed, so if you don't come right at 9am on the weekends, be prepared to wait.  Also, it's cash only, but there are plenty of ATMs in the area."
"PA","Decent breakfast and great service. I found the much touted corned beef hash to be too salty but everything else we ordered was great. Overall, I recommend this restaurant for breakfast"
"PA","A great place to grab brunch on a lazy day when all you feel like doing is choke your arteries.
The omelette with mashed potatoes and hotcakes are my top favorites. Be sure to be carrying cash for this one !"
"PA","I'm giving it a 4 but honestly, I'm somewhere in between a 3 and 4. I think I walked in with high expectations - I wasn't disappointed, but I also wasn't wow'ed. 

This was my first stop in Pittsburgh. Apparently Obama has dined here and this was the place to be. I didn't actually do my own research, just let my friend guide me along. 

The hotcakes are no doubt delicious. They are like huge crepes filled with your choice of fruit pretty much and a ton of whipped cream. We actually shared one banana walnut hotcake and it was plenty. Definitely a great deal. We could've just ordered that and been full. However, we also ordered the corned beef hash. This  was an extremely heavy dish. It was also really salty. It comes with toast too. 

Huge portions, delicious food, great prices. That's definitely where the 4 is coming from. For me, the food was just too heavy and buttery, so much so that I don't know if I would come back.  Personally, I prefer my fluffy, fruity pancakes. With all that said - If you're visiting, it is still worth a stop."
"PA","If you Love Butter this is the place for you, it is yummy & delicious quick friendly service & the potatoes are tasty!
No credit cards this place is cash only"
"PA","So happy I looked at yelp when I checked in to the hotel in Shadyside.  Pamela's hotcakes deserve all accolades - they rank in the top 3 in my book.  I tried the banana walnut crepe pancakes - fresh bananas, walnuts, and whipped cream in a delicate tasty pancake - if you like banana bread - you will probably like this - maple syrup wasn't needed but I used some anyway - it is better than delicious.  The eggs and sausage were good too.  I came for a late lunch during the week and did not have to wait.  Service was efficient.  I enjoyed the ambience of the diner and Walnut street - so much fun to hang out here."
"PA","So lovely, so Pittsburgh. Do yourself a favor and try the Banana hot cakes. They're freakin' unbelievable. If one dreamed up a perfect diner experience they would dream up a place like Pamela's. Lovely servers too."
"PA","I'm from California and hotcakes is something that's not common in our food vocabulary. We just settle on pancakes and call it a day.

My brother took me and my mother to Pamela's for brunch and it was pretty packed. Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes. They all looked very good, but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes (was craving strawberries). We finally got seated, ordered what we want, and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner. The food came out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes. They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness. The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries, as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar, that was like the cherry on top. It was pure harmony.

Definitely check it out when you're in Pittsburgh!"
"PA","OMG best pancakes ever. Do yourself a favor and get the nation's greatest pancake ever - banana chocolate chip. I still have fond food memories about my single Pamela's experience - almost 4 years later. I need these pancakes back in my life!"
"PA","Pamela's was my first real dining experience in Pittsburgh. I was told dozens of times by native Pittsburghians about how Pamela's hotcakes are not only a Pittsburgh staple but a White House favorite. 

Can't argue with that. I had the good fortune of sampling both the banana chocolate chip hotcakes as well as the banana walnut hotcakes--the former is by far superior, even if you're a nut fiend like yours truly. Perfectly crisped around the edges and delectably moist and sweet, the crepes are loaded with melted chocolate and banana slices. I will shamelessly admit to eating two orders... by myself. 

However, the rest of the offerings at Pamela's are your typical diner fare, average at best. Come here for the hotcakes, then go home and sleep it off. Your day is done.

*Pamela's is cash-only and extremely busy on weekends. (On weekdays, service is surprisingly brisk.)
*I recommend the Shadyside or Squirrel Hill locations over the one in Oakland."
"PA","Disgustingly amazing breakfast as usual. Order what you want and accept you are done for the day!"
"PA","Iv'e been to better places. I always forget that they dont take a card so I have to remember to get cash out when I go there. I usually order their omelets. The veggies are always crunchy so I taste more of a raw onion than I do my omelet. The food comes out fast which is great until I tasted the food. I checked it out three or four times  to see if it might be different but the omelets were the same. Raw and crunchy. overall  nice atmosphere, nice service, but the food is blah"
"PA","Huge delicious servings. My wife and I were blown away by how good the food was and how huge the portions were for the price. Their crepe pancakes rock especially the banana pecan ones."
"PA","MMMM crepes. If you've had crepes as ihop or other breakfast restaurants, take that and multiple it by 100 notches of yummy breakfast goodness. Then, kick that up 10 more times. And there you will find Pamela's nestled between strawberry crepes and banana chocolate chip hot cakes. If you're in Pittsburgh, it's a law (unofficially) that you must have a Primanti's sandwich and breakfast at Pamela's. MMMMM crepes."
"PA","How Pamela's became a Pittsburgh institution is completely beyond me. The food is average at best (think a step or two above Denny's or Waffle House). Pancakes were soggy and bland and the veggie omelete was chocked full of processed, cheese-like goo and assorted goodness straight out of a can."
"PA","The hotcakes are *delicious*.  I had a strawberry filling in mine.  It was really sweet, and the brown sugar in the filling might have been somewhat excessive, but it was a really nice treat.
If you live in Pittsburgh, I *highly* recommend you try Pamela's.  I know I'll be going back when I can."
"PA","One of the best breakfasts ever. Awesome diner feel. Friendly service. Delicious corned beef hash. Addictive. And the best pancakes i've ever eaten - really unique and perfect texture. I wish i had a place like this near me. As good as it gets."
"PA","These hotcakes (crepe pancakes) are to die for. I just had the blueberry hotcakes this morning and I almost creamed my pants.   I obviously couldn't finish the whole thing or else I'd be in a food coma or turn diabetic from the rich brown sugar embedded between the layers or cream, butter, and magic, but it was one of the best breakfast pancakes/crepe variations I've ever had.  This is actually quite a big deal to me because I've had classic Paris crepes with Nutella, and this is up there on the ""omg you have to try it"" scale.

The quirky diner scene with checkered tables was a nice addition, and the staff is rather friendly. Apparently this place is crowded for brunch on weekends, but going on an overcast Tuesday morning at 9 seemed to work out well.  Anyway, if you're in Pittsburgh, you must try this place. For Shame if you have not!"
"PA","Mmmm. Crepe pancakes. What an idea. 4.25 stars (sure, I can give quarter stars, why not).

Per the bf's suggestion, we went to Pamela's for brunch, on our first stop of our day trip in Pittsburgh. Hmmm..... a brunch place, you say? Why not! Cool decor inside- half hipster, half well....midwest diner. Our wait wasn't really that long- we put in our name at around 11:30am on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend, and was seated within 30 minutes. In the meantime while we waited, we checked out the cool Mexican place above Pamela's. Cool.

He got the standard breakfast special - which was standard, there's no way to really rate that stuff- and choc chip banana hotcakes. I ordered the blueberry hotcakes.

His choc chip banana hotcakes were so so good. Bananas stuffed into a thin crepe of a pancake with the chocolate all melting inside.....omg, it was good. My blueberry crepe pancakes seemed to be extra crispy (which I liked, by the way) with brown sugar and sour cream in it. I felt like there needed to be more stuffing in it, but it was still pretty good.

Coffee was standard here as well. But I LOVEEEeeee diners, so this was a place that was above your normal diner. Cool. I still crave those crepe hotcakes...."
"PA","Pamela's is certainly a Pittsburgh institution, and for good reason! Of the several locations in the city, the Shadyside spot is my favorite, probably because it was the first Pamela's I ever ate at.  I love breakfast food, but I'm never big on breakfast-only places because they tend to be too small and crowded, and hardly worth the wait.  But Pamela's food is as close to perfection as you'll ever get, so the long line and cramped space isn't even a factor.  Personally, I love their hotcakes, omelets, and hash browns, but everything on the menu is mouth-watering and inexpensive!"
"PA","Everything I wanted to say has already been covered in previous reviews, so I'll just leave it at this:

OH MY GOD GET THE HOTCAKES

Seriously, get them."
"PA","Maybe this is blasphemy of some sort, but Pamela's? I don't know what other people see in it.

There's always a line out the door, so I rarely end up going there.  Why wait when there are 600 million other places within walking distance?

It's cash only, which is basically a business's way of saying ""Hello, customer.  I really hate you, and want to make sure you have to go out of your way to find a way to pay me.""  It's like when someone intentionally gets a 2-door car when a 4-door model is available.  You only do that if you really hate your passengers.

The food is, well, it's okay! But just okay.  The pancakes are super-greasy.  They're not bad, though.  I do have to put in a word for their corned beef hash, though, because evidently that is excellent.

I would like to one day try their lunch/dinner food, though.  One thing I do love about Pamela's is the price.  It's dirt cheap, and that's great.

But get a credit machine! It's not like you can't afford it! Stop abusing your customers!"
"PA","It has to be at least 25 years since I ate at Pamela's. It was one of my mother's favorite places to grab a quick bite. We met a dear friend on Saturday midday for brunch/lunch, and I ask myself, why did I wait so long to go back, after a multitude of trips back to the ""Burgh"" throughout the years? 

I had an omelet -- cooked to perfection. I am a picky omelet eater. My eggs have to be cooked just so . . . and so they were! Truly a rarity. The accompanying potatoes were heavenly. My husband loved his corned beef and hash with eggs and potatoes. The short stack of pancakes that our friend ordered was huge . . . and after one bite, I was in Seventh Heaven. Oh, how I wish I could make pancakes just like that! The thin pancakes, almost crepe-like, with their crispy outer edges are divine. 

This location begs for an aesthetic makeover . . . looks like the same furniture as 25 years ago, but what it lacks there, it makes up for in the yummy food. Service was quick but unremarkable. 

Next time we're back in town, we'll definitely stop by for breakfast -- early so we don't have to wait!"
"PA","A fantastic place to grab brunch on a weekend! 

We tried the special Banana Walnut Hotcakes and that was sooo delish! We also ordered the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs and that Corned Beef was even better than the ones from Le Peep back in NJ!

SO wish we had a Pamela's back home and the prices in Pitt was VERY cheap comparing to NYC and NJ!  

PS: This is a CASH-ONLY place and setting is very much like a diner, but AWESOME food. ENJOY!"
"PA","Delicious as always.  What more can really be said?  I always get the crepe pancakes with brown sugar and sour cream.  I remember when you could only get them with strawberries, but blueberries are now an excellent alternative.

Their coffee is as spectacularly terrible as ever.  It's been bad for as long as I can remember, like they're intentionally not serving good coffee.  It's the only thing from keeping Pamela's from being a 5-star breakfast place.  Regardless, Pamela's is still a Pittsburgh classic and always a great breakfast destination."
"PA","I live a few blocks from Pamela's and each time that I walk by on the weekends there seems to be quite a few people waiting (and others have raved) so had been wanting to try it for a while. After waiting 30-45  minutes on a Saturday morning for brunch, I wasn't that impressed. It is cheap, the service is fast and they serve ample buttery portions of diner food. If you're not hungover, I hope you have a good reason for going. You might as well just eat some grease and rub it all over your face."
"PA","I really wanted to like this place because of all the positive reviews.  I love breakfast, and I am a sucker for corned beef hash (I order it pretty much when it's on a menu).  Sadly, I walked away from my meal with a ""meh"" feeling.

First off, I kept hearing about these pancakes I gotta try.  Well, I figured what better way to experience them than to order a short stack, right?  They were super buttery... Too much so.  I loved the thin fluffy texture, and the crispy edges were a unique touch, but those flap jacks were oozing butter (despite not using the included butter ""pat"" that comes with them)... It's all I could taste.  Too bad.  People generally recommended the stuffed pancakes... Perhaps this well teach me not to listen to the suggestions for the banana chocolate chip pancakes (next time).

My real disappointment was that the corned beef hash was probably just a few points above the stuff you can buy at the store.  If it weren't for the large pieces of crispy potatoes, or the sauteed onion... I would have sworn it came from a can.  Plus it was super salty and the meat over-ground... Kinda looked like pet food.  What happened to using chunks of real corned-beef and making the dish look like a hash?

I'm a transplant to pitt and I'm still figuring the place out.  Nevertheless, I'm still looking forward to trying some the other recommended food items... But... If you want really good authentic corned beef hash: Tasty Diner in Silver Spring, MD.  Can't beat it."
"PA","Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time, Yelp pointed us in the right direction towards Pamela's for breakfast.

It passed the ""parking lot"" or rather waiting room test and was packed to the the brim on Saturday at 11am... Perfect, this means we are at the right place for a good breakfast. Only a short wait later we were seated comfortably at a table.

Great signage to say that they were a ""CASH ONLY"" establishment. Thanks for not making it awkward at the end....

Overall the food was excellent. I had a Hotcake with Walnuts and Bananas... I wished it came with some sort of side because I was still hungry afwards.  My friend had a omelet with home fries which she said was delicious as well.

It wasn't life changing and innovative, but the food was excellent for a brunch location in Pittsburgh. Loved Walnut street as well. Beautiful location for a breakfast spot.

Parking wasn't so bad either! 

See you next time Pamela's!"
"PA","Each time I've been here (3 or 4 times as the writing of this review) I've ordered the hotcakes. And when they are sooo good why would you ever order anything else? 

This location of Pamela's is certainly nice and clean enough. The waitstaff are attentive and the kitchen is fast. So really this is a review of those hotcakes. The crispy edges really are the best part. That said the middle with the fruit stuffing, brown sugar, sour and whipped cream is pretty awesome too. 

I have eaten here each time I've visited my sister out in the 'Burgh, a tradition that I hope will continue."
"PA","Two words: grossly overrated. If I am going to wait an hour for breakfast/brunch, it needs to not only be good, but also unique. Unfortunately, Pamela's is neither of these things. Then again, the hour-long wait does provide you will ample time to find a ATM because they only take cash. If you want to wait in line for an hour for food that is both good and unique, try Coca Cafe."
"PA","Cash only! We had an excellent brunch here. I was very pleased with the crepe-like hotcakes (they're a necessary sampling if you've never had! a tad overbuttered but soooo good), the burger was solidly tasty, and the service was quite good considering the bustle. It's pretty basic, but it's really excellent quality. I would strongly recommend it for a quick stop-off bite. It's not fine dining, but if you want to lose the pretentious and just chow down, this is an A+ joint."
"PA","Delicious hot cakes. A really cute, fun, and reasonable place to go for a filling breakfast. The place was packed. That speaks for itself. The wait staff was excellent."
"PA","one of the best places for breakfast ever. It gets packed every weekend with students, parents, and locals alike. don't be afraid to put your name in and wait the little bit to get an amazing breakfast. the interior is pretty festive with old school board games all over the walls and ceiling. Has some of the standards of breakfast such as pancakes (hotcakes), eggs, omelets, etc  but also has their spin on it. 

this is a cash only restaurant so make sure that you have plenty of cash in order to pay for this meal. I really liked the western style omelet that i got which had chorizo sausage in it. so good"
"PA","Serve a good breakfast, but I only have the patience to go on weekdays (that aren't holidays, bc they are closed) bc it is mobbed on the weekends. Wish they were open past early afternoon, I would do breakfast for dinner there in a second (I imagine it wouldn't be so crowded)."
"PA","Oh my GOD. Get on line. Let Pamela's seduce your tastebuds into your imminent food coma.

The wait & service: 
Pretty decent considering the overwhelming flow of people in and out of this fine establishment. The evil part is that they make you wait outside while you stare at the unlucky window-seaters chomp away at their food. Service was a little shoddy and unresponsive. I had to steal syrup from a neighboring empty table. -1/2 star.

The hours: 
This is delicious, greasy, goodness. It'd be amazing drunk food if they were open late at night -- closed in the middle of the afternoon...what gives? -1/2 star.

THE BANANA WALNUT HOTCAKES:
ARGHHHH SO FRUSTRATINGLY GOOD!!!! They are delicious, filling, crispy, succulent, flavorful, and so addicting. The only thing missing was the jar of Nutella that I should have brought. 

THE CORNED BEEF HASH:
This i saved for later, as the hotcakes were surprisingly filling. The potatoes were well cooked and it was a great salty break from my assault on the hotcakes."
"PA","Great place to go on a Saturday or Sunday morning after drinking way too much. The hotcakes are unbelievable but I am a really big fan of their home fries. I also really like their corned beef hash. I'll usually get some sort of omelette and pair it with a hotcake (usually chocolate but blueberry is pretty good too). I'll then make sure there is plenty of home fries and get a side of the corned beef hash. This usually puts me in a food coma but makes me feel fantastic especially after waking up a little hungover or still drunk from the night before.

Oh. you have to pay with cash. And this location is also pretty packed so there is usually a line up outside. But it's so worth it."
"PA","Don't be deceived by the nondescript ""PAMELA'S RESTAURANT"" sign in the sketchy font out front. The interior of this place is cozily modern, and the food is fantastic:

- Home fries: cooked to a mealy perfection, then smashed before frying in order to maximize their crisp-able surface area. They must put some kind of cheese in them to get it that lovely golden brown color and perfectly crunchy texture. 
- Hotcakes: kind of like a thick crepe, but better. Each bite is different - sometimes sweet, sometimes a little saltier, fruitier, other times crunchier. Delicious every single time. 
- Omelettes: Their egg white omelettes do a great job posing as normal eggs. The fillings are fresh and flavorful without overpowering the flavor of the egg. 
- Toast: Yes, even their toast is excellent. Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. And their toast comes pre-buttered - taking care of that pesky cold-butter-on-hard-toast problem.

It's greasy spoon brunch fare at its very best. My parents ate here two days in a row, which says a lot because they're Asians from Asia and typically don't like greasy American-style brunch foods. I'm an Asian from America and typically don't like to agree with my parents, but I'll make an exception for Pamela's. This place is amazing."
"PA","The best pancakes ever! Especially the strawberry filled. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait but if you get there early it's fine. I love it!"
"PA","I guess I like Pamelas.

Their hotcakes are awesome, though they do need to distribute their brown sugar around instead of getting them in lumps here and there.  Their potatoes are good; I like 'em.  Their corned beef hash is mixed with their potatoes, which I dig, except that their corned beef is too salty :(.  Their tex mex omelete is pretty bad, but I guess that's Pittsburgh.

Despite that, I still go to Pamelas too often for my wallet's liking."
"PA","On my trip to Pittsburgh we decided to stop by here for a Sunday brunch after hearing it was one of the best breakfast places in the city.  

It was very crowded and they pack you in like a high school cafeteria.  It is a no frills atmosphere with the menu waiting on the table.  It was packed with hung over college kids when we were there around 12:30 pm on a Sunday. They have a good variety of breakfast foods to choose from including hotcakes, french toast, omelettes, etc.  They also had the classic breakfast sides of bacon, sausage and home fries.

I chose the strawberry hotcakes.  This was a couple of crepe like pancakes with strawberries and sour cream stuffed between and some whipped cream on top.

The hotcakes were excellent.  They were soft in the middle, but kind of crispy around the edges.  Just like I want them.  Also, the strawberries inside were very good.  They were sweet and juicy.  This was the best part of the meal.

Now for the not so good.  The home fries were mushy all around and there might have been some type of cheese sauce on them.  There was something creamy mixed with them that I was not sure about.  I like my home fries to be crispy on the outside.  These were just mush.

Finally the bacon was bush league.  If you are going to market yourself as a breakfast spot you cannot serve rinky dink bacon like this.  It was a disgrace.  You need to have big meaty, crispy flavorful bacon.  This bacon was thinner than a piece of paper.  It was just not what you should have if you are specializing in breakfast.  If I wouldn't have enjoyed the hotcakes so much, I would have rated this place a 2.

Go for the hotcakes, but order the sausage over then bacon and skip the home fries."
"PA","Best Breakfast in town for a cheap price"
"PA","The past weekend, I was visiting my bff's in Pittsburgh.  We decided to do Sunday brunch, and I asked bff 1 where she wanted to go - she said she'd heard Pamela's in Shadyside was amazing, and had been dying to go there.  BFF 2 said she had heard all about it and she too had been dying to go, and so it was decided.  

with hype like that, i was hoping it would live up to expectations.  when we arrived, we put our names on the list and waited for about 10-15 minutes.  Pamela's is pretty small, there are maybe 20 tables - some for only 2, some for 4-tops, but the turn over time seems pretty fast.  we settled in and looked over the menu.  the prices are pretty amazing - you can easily do brunch here for under $10/person.  i ordered the strawberry ""hotcakes"" which are not actually crepes, despite what reviews here say... but they are a bit thinner than regular pancakes (crepes would be much thinner than this) and rolled up like crepes.  mine were stuffed with sliced strawberry, brown sugar, and usually sour cream (i asked for mine w/o the sour cream - this place is enough of a greasy spoon).  others at the table had the strawberry and blueberry hotcakes.  we also ordered the hash browns for the table to share.  

the hotcakes are most certainly fried - the edges are greasy and crisp.  delicious to eat!  i think i may have made a mistake ordering no sour cream, b/c the hotcake stuffed with strawberries and dry piles of brown sugar was at times too sweet for me.  next time, i'd ask for very light sour cream or possibly no sour cream and no brown sugar.  the hash browns were amazingly delicious, so buttery and melt in your mouth good.  these were gobbled up by the 3 of us!  the hotcakes were large, and too much for me to finish!  

service was ok - pamela's is a pretty simple place in that aspect, you see your server when you order and to drop off the check.  aside from that, they stand back and let you marvel at the good food.  i would definitely return to pamela's on my next trip to the 'burgh."
"PA","A very popular place, with Obama's visit as the most recent claim to fame...and they definitely play that up. Very much a college, cool kid's place feel. The servers are nice, the portions are generous. Got the classic bacon, eggs, and pancakes deal. The protein wasn't anything special but the pancakes were delicious! They look huge but are crepe thin. The edges are crisped and taste almost carmelized."
"PA","A very popular weekend brunch place, with good reason.  The specialty pancakes are incredible, even if mine had so much brown sugar in it that I could literally feel the grains against my teeth.  That isn't a knock or praise, that's just how it is.  If that sounds good to you, you will love Pamela's...if that grosses you out, there's a GNC across the street, go make a protein shake.  

They turn tables fast for a place this busy, and you get a lot of food for your hard earned cash (they only take cash, so hit up the PNC bank on the corner while you wait 20 minutes for a table).

The service is pretty quick since the wait staff doesn't seem to strictly ascribe to seating sections or table divisions the way the British and French carved up the Middle East (and look at all the problems THAT caused).  They also bring you your check with the food and get you off the table fast by making you pay up front.  I have no problems with any of this, Pennsylvanians are known in my home state for their efficiency and lack of skills operating watercraft.  

Every decent U.S. City has a place like Pamela's, even some not-so-decent ones (that's right, I'm talking to you, Montgomery, and you, Little Rock).  Pittsburgh's specialty is the crepe like ""hotcakes"".  They are delicious, with lots of brown sugar (see above), and a faintly salty flavor along with a crispiness on the edges.  I tore that shit apart."
"PA","Another help wanted sign and closed Memorial day. Ahhh"
"PA","Whenever I am back in Pittsburgh, I always try to get to Pamela's for breakfast.  There's one in Millville that is easier to get into on a Saturday.  The 5 other places are incredibly popular..Witness most of these current reviews.  The lines to get in are intimidating.  One would think if you waited until 11:00 AM,  it would be better...Nope.

The only pancakes I've ever had like Pamela's can be found at the excellent Original Pancake House chain..Their 49'er pancakes are the equal of Pamela's. 

 Pamela's is unique.  Their hash browns are very different as well.  Almost creamy in texture.  The two women who started this chain came up with these two recipes and it formed the basis of one of Pittsburgh's most successful restaurants.

Hopefully one day, a former cook will give us their recipes."
"PA","Pamela's is an abomination of a breakfast place that represents the worst of everything.  However, to make up for the food being awful, you will have to wait on line for 20 minutes and then dine in cramped and uncomfortable seating.

It is, for some reason, unfathomably popular.  The best thing on the menu is their crepe-like pancakes, which are nicely crisped on the edges.  They are nicely crisped on the edges because they are cooked in a disgusting margarine-like substance that always leaves me, personally, feeling a bit ill.  The coffee is forgettable, the eggs are passable, the bacon is inevitably chewy -- which right there should cause someone to be marched out to the firing squad -- and their lyonnaise potatoes are insultingly limp (and, like the pancakes, soaked in margarine).

If you are dragged here by your friends, find new friends.  If you can't do that, then try to get one of the pancakes that come with some sort of whipped or sour cream.  Not because they're better, mind you, but because at least the cream will help balance the fat that comes from a machine with fat that, at some point in its history, came from a cow.

Better alternatives to Pamela's in Pittsburgh:  on the 'nice' end, Coca Café or even Square Café, on the 'greasy spoon' end either DeLuca's or JoJo's.

Frankly, I think I'd rather eat the completely boring and institutional breakfasts at Eat and Park than go to Pamela's again.  At least they have heard of this thing called ""butter."""
"PA","Absolutely delicious pancakes. I can't wait to return to Pittsburgh for these pancakes. The word on the street is, Obama loves Pamela's too. But how could anyone not?"
"PA","After waiting in line for about twenty minutes our group was seated.  The place was completely packed.  It looked like someone's basement or garage with tables in it.  Various photos adorned the walls.  I tried the world famous hot cakes.  They were delicious, except I only ate 1/4 of them since there was a very long hair wrapped around the hot cake.  Pamela's turned out to be a waste of money for me and I left hungry.

There's nothing THAT great about Pamela's.  It's like breakfast at most any other diner."
"PA","New Yorkers.... if you like Clinton St. Bakery, this is Pittsburgh's answer. Their pancakes are the best I ever had. I had banana walnut once that was unbelievable. I am a sucker for corned beef hash and this was the best I've had as well. Really, this place is a national treasure."
"PA","New life goal: eat at every Pamela's in Pittsburgh.

Justifiably famous for their hotcakes, Pamela's is probably one of the best diners ever. Even when Obama visited the 'Burgh last year he stopped in. By the cashier, there's a picture of him flashing a giant smile, flanked by whom I'm assuming are the owners. (He went to the one on the Strip -- I asked.)

This particular location is in the Walnut Street shopping district, and it's not terribly large. It's not as funky as the Oakland area Pamela's, but the food is just as good. Upstairs is an unrelated Peruvian shop/cafe, which doesn't seem to serve food on Sundays.

At about 11:30 AM Sunday morning, on Valentine's Day no less, the wait here was only half an hour. Not bad! The crowd seemed to have doubled by the time my party and I left. Originally we had wanted to go to the Oakland one but it was a total mob scene and tried this location instead.

The Food: 
Fattening, delicious, huge and cheap: every diner should aspire to this! They don't serve lunch specials on Sundays, which is fine because all we wanted were the hotcakes! We all got breakfast specials ($6.75 for 2 eggs any style, 2 hotcakes and ham or sausage or bacon) and were allowed to substitute home fries or toast for the meat options. For $2 extra you could substitute a specialty hotcake. 

HUGE HUGE HUGE PORTIONS. Two separate gigantic dinner plates were needed for 1) eggs and home fries and 2) hotcakes which took up the entire plate. I made the mistake of spreading butter on top of my regular hotcakes, which I didn't realize were already approximately 50% butter in the first place. They're thinner and crispier than your average pancake and a little too salty but still good. The speciality hotcakes are more crepe-like in that they're stuffed with the filling of your choice and whipped cream and then rolled up. Whoa.

Coffee's kind of weak. The servers are the sweetest people you'll ever meet. Cash only."
"PA","Love this place! All the food is delicious and lots of options, I always have a hard time deciding what I want to order, whether its the delicious pancakes or the croissant french toast (my mouth is watering just thinking about it!) The only thing I'm not a big fan of is the corned beef hash - super salty! But other than that, great portions, great taste, great atmosphere. 

It's cash only but there are multiple ATMs close-by so no excuse to not try this place if you haven't already!"
"PA","This Pamela's has a much different environment than the one in Oakland. This had a much more intimate feel and was a lot smaller and less ""diner"" -esque. 

The morning after breakfast special was pretty good with 2 large hotcakes (important sidenote: if a pancake and a crepe had children I would imagine this is what their child would look like, the outside and edges are crispy but it's thick enough to be considered a pancake). The eggs were also of epic proportions but the bacon was quite scarce. A measly two and a half pieces...

The jumbo tossed salad was built for a king - it was brought out in the large mixing bowl that they tossed that sucker in. I asked for cheddar and dressing on the side and it was quite scrumptious."
"PA","I had to checkout Pamela's because of all the high ratings.  Didn't know they were a CASH ONLY kind of place boo. Come on now who does that.  Didn't know you had to it was metered parking double boo.  Couldn't find the restroom triple boo!? Maybe that ones on me I just couldn't figure it out, outside!?

So how does banana walnut crepes on Walnut Street sound like!? Why not.  I ended up ordering some and they even split the 1 order of crepe into 2 plates and loaded them for us which was nice. Their famous crepes weren't so amazing as I hoped they were barely OK for me, they are just crepes. I would have like to try more the menu but I only had like $10 in bills and coins. And again another place that only takes cash really. I don't get it.  If you're ever here with nothing but $10 in bills and coins you order wisely.  You start looking over their menu and notice wow everything's famous, famous lyonnaise potatoes, famous crepe, famous corned beef hash, famous egg salad, etc. haha.  Don't waste your time with the crepes for about the same price or a little more, you should go for something else on menu, everything's under $10 and inexpensive.  Stretch your dollar and order a soft drinks that has free refills and bottomless coffee or just order a water.  They have lots of different omelets and sandwiches. 

Inside there are a lot of seating, tables and chairs are old and so are everything else about it.  There's a wall of photos in the back wall.  Service was friendly and I had to tip in coins. But I'd try one of the other locations or something else. Other possible MEH but I'll leave it as a OK.

""18% gratuity may be added to parties over 6"" on the menu, does that mean that if I'm nice enough I don't have to pay?"
"PA","Definitely a must for any guest. I only sampled the strawberry stuffed crepes, which sound rather ordinary. Rest assured, they were anything but. The crepes are the same as their pancakes, which are light, lacy and crisp around the edges. Perfection by themselves....they come with several fillings and toppings but I decided to go with my wait person's recommendation. The strawberries were sliced paper thin, fresh, not at all syrupy, and there were two, huge, filled crepes on my plate-enough for two people. I asked for the sour cream on the side, and there was a dollop of freshly whipped cream (not instant, I know these things) in the middle of both crepes. Dusted over the top was a thin coat of granulated sugar (it may have been turbinado) and just a hint of course sea salt. The texture and taste was amazing! The menu was interesting with omelets, egg dishes, french toast, and the usual breakfast fare. All that I saw going by looked good, but my recommendation would be, if you go only once, skip all that and go right for a pancake/crepe creation. You will NOT be disappointed. Also, the order came out 1 minute after the wait person brought my coffee; like magic. This place is a jewel in the middle of Walnut Street!"
"PA","Excellent food. Great omelettes, great pan-cakes, everything is excellent!"
"PA","A bit crowded, but amazing blueberry and strawberry pancakes. I fought to go here and waited about 20 mins for a table (weekend) but it was totally worth it."
"PA","Blueberry pancakes were amazing"
"PA","um ridiculously good and so quick and filling. I shared the hotcakes and got a side of eggs and sausage. need both my sweet and savory. This place totally hit the spot.. 930 am SAT morning. um yah, a  short wait witha group of 5+ a toddler seated in about 10 min ! woot 

The crepes (hot cakes) are delicious her signature one with the strawberries is the bomb. also, eggs, crispy bacon toast not bad either. Came here for breakfast while visiting family in the area and really enjoyed the meal. Only draw back is parking sucks the lot is ridiculous and street parking is hard because of the traffic. Also cash only.. sort of annoying.. but would totally go back and recommend to all ."
"PA","So apparently this is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh? Alright! 

Well, it isn't bad. Three stars seems a little low but four feels too high. 

I got Gail's favorite eggs (scrambled eggs with cream cheese and scallions) and they were pretty good. I was hoping the cream cheese and scallions would be blended in, alas, they were just on top. Still a good combo, though. Their famous potatoes really are amazing, definitely the highlight of the meal! 

My friend got the corned beef hash and it was UBER SALTY. Like, super ridiculously salty. I know hash usually tends to have a lot of salt but this was outta control. 

I like that they have rye toast. I don't like that they have Pepsi products and super rude employees. Ya win some, ya lose some, I guess."
"PA","Yo! Fucking brown sugar and blueberries in my hotcakes? Legit!"
"PA","Breakfast is always good. But too much Pamela's seems greasy. You can cook it all at home for much cheaper. However, the pricing really is low when you're lazy. The wait is ridicious at times. I would recommend the Shadyside location over the other two. It's more clean and better parking. Cash only."
"PA","If I had to pick one thing that I missed most about Pittsburgh it would be Pamela's. I love breakfast and they do it right. I do think that this is the best location, after breakfast or brunch you can stroll through Shadyside. Sometimes you do have to wait but its never been outrageous and I'm not sure if I've ever had anything I didn't like!  My husband prefers the Oakland location but Shadyside is my pick.  (Its because of the shopping, I won't lie.)"
"PA","The hotcakes were good but not special enough for a trip across town or a long wait.  My bacon is thin, wimpy, and burnt.  Any respectable breakfast place should have thick, brown, crispy, flat bacon."
"PA","All the positive reviews speak for itself! If you're in the area, you should definately check it out!  The portions are good decent sized -  I went there with a friend and we ended up sharing the Choc chip/banana pancake and the ham and cheese omelette.  Of the diners I've been to, the home fries here have the most flavored. I honestly didn't even have to use the salt. Maybe just a pinch of pepper for added taste.

My only complaint is the limited amt of space in the restaurant. I hope they consider expanding because space is tight!  We went in the only day with winter coats, scarves, gloves and I felt like I had no room to breathe..  Plus, the distance between tables are so close that I ended up putting my coat and all misc stuff on my lap.  The two person tables are so small when you have coffee jug, condiments, syrup, large plates of food, etc etc.  You get the picture..

Overall, I would rate the place with only 3 stars considering all things.. However, the 4 stars reflect the food rating."
"PA","I have been in search of pancakes like
this since a visit to Seatlle. Thes pancakes are so thin and wonderfully
crispy around the edges, yummy! 
It was 19 degrees outside 
yet people were still waiting to eat at Pamela's.
If your ever in Pittsburgh make this a must
on your list. We will be returning for breakfast
before our trip is over! 
You don't want to miss out on this great little place.
Anyone know fof a place like this in Orange County, California?"
"PA","you must come here, and you may even want to dedicate 2 separate breakfast/brunch meals here! 

hotcakes are the specialty, and you can get them a variety of ways. they're really good plain, but also super delish with the stuff in it (ie banana choco chip, blueberry, strawberry). personal fav is the strawberry or plain. i usually get plain hotcakes sans butter, and sprinkle granulated sugar on =)

other things to try: corned beef hash is yummmmy. 

out of all the pamela's, i like this one the best. this is also the place i mist most from pitts=( it's soooooooooo greasy delicious awesome."
"PA","I think it's the lack of breakfast places in Pittsburgh that makes Pamela's so popular. I couldn't find anything special here except the value. You really get a lot of food for you money, and it's pretty good food, but it's not spectacular. I'll go on a weekday, but the wait on weekends isn't worth it. I can just stay home and eat cereal, thank you."
"PA","Clean place.  Pancakes a bit too buttery for my taste (and health!).  But the vibe was good, and people were enjoying themselves, so I'd go back again - just wouldn't order the pancakes!"
"PA","any time im in pittsburgh i have to stop at pamela's.  it's an absolute staple!

the decor is more stimulating than the coffee (which, mind you, is awesome) and both work hand in hand to yank you out of your hangover (there's also something about pittsburgh that inspires beer consumption).  must tries: the pancakes and the hash browns.  awesome!"
"PA","If God ate breakfast, this is where he would go! The only thing you should order if this is your first time is the Strawberry Hotcakes! Be prepared to go into diabetic shock and a food coma immediately after wards! Good stuff!"
"PA","I walked over to Pamela's for take out breakfast while I waited for my friends to pick me up for our friend's wedding.

I decided to get the breakfast special -- sausage, scrambled eggs, and regular hotcakes. I waited only 15 minutes for my order and I overheard one of the managers say that Pamela's was featured in People's magazine. Not sure if it was in a past, latest, or  future issue, but it made me look forward to breakfast even more and I definitely thought it lived up to the hype. I quickly gambled up the sausage and scrambled eggs, but those hotcakes were AWESOME! They were thin like crepes and with butter and syrup, it was drool worthy. On my first bite I literally said, ""Hmmm..."" With the breakfast special, if you pay an extra $2, you can get one a stack of the specialty hotcakes (blueberry, chocolate chip, strawberry, or banana walnut).

The only downside of this place is that it is cash only."
"PA","When I'm in a new city, I like to find a good breakfast place where I can take my friends or visit myself when I'm actually up during breakfast time. 

Pamela's is the place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. The other reviews are correct, though sometimes the pancakes can be a bit too greasy for breakfast fare and other times it can be a hit or miss between this location and the Squirrel Hill location. Half a star for that, and half a star for being cash only. If you can look past that, it's definitely a 5 star place. 

In other news, my pick for San Jose is Stacks and my pick for St. Louis is Rooster."
"PA","delicate and fluffy jussssssst the way i like 'em! 

wait wasnt tooo bad (5-10 min maybe). its short if its just 2 ppl.

i had the choc chip cookie pancake - melts in your mouth son!

def put me into a nice cozy nap mood tho. peep it out at least once."
"PA","The breakfast special here should be enough for most people. The pancakes are great. The service is generally very good too. The only bummer is the lines for this location (and all Pamela's locations in fact) are super long around brunch/lunch times."
"PA","We met a group of friends at Pamela's for brunch, it was my first time at the restaurant and I loved it. This no-frills place serves the best pancakes that I have eaten in a long time. I had their Blueberry pancakes as part of my breakfast combo. My friends had the strawberry pancakes and the french toast with walnuts. All three dishes were delicious (my mouth is watering just thinking about that meal). 

The pancakes are sort of in between flapjacks and crepes, and the blueberries (fresh ones) were folded into the pancake with sour cream  and brown sugar (which complimented the blueberries beautifully).  The rest of my breakfast was tasty too, but nothing to write home about, especially compared to the pancakes. 

They get very crowded and they will not seat you until your entire party is ready to be seated. Also, they do not accept credit cards (CASH ONLY)."
"PA","Woah. Thank goodness for yelp. That's how I learned about this breakfast gem. The boy just moved to PA so we went out foraging for breakfast, but before I did, I did a quick Yelp search. We headed to Pamela's as soon as I saw the reviews. 

There were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down. Here's my only complaint. We waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down, but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line, which was a bit rude. 

The seating is tight, but the atmosphere diner-esque. Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art (some for sale, no less). 

The menu, while not particularly health-conscious, was heavy on eggs and pancakes. We went with the specialty pancakes, banana-walnut and choc. chip.  Both were delicious. I really wanted to and tried to finish mine, but I just couldn't man up. 

The other complaint, which is of no-fault of the restaurant, was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene. Despite the deliciousness of the food, things got tense for a while. 

I think the next time I have a serious pankcake-hankering, I'll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela's."
"PA","Patrons from all over Pittsburgh come to enjoy Pamela's thin and delicious pancakes, huge servings of home fries and three egg omelets - and they should.

The first of the Pamela's family, this Shadyside staple has been around long before owners Gail Klingensmith and Pamela Cohen decided to branch out across Pittsburgh.  Since 1980, Pamela's has been voted ""Best Breakfast"" by Pittsburgh's City Paper survey.  Not to mention the diner's modest flare received the White House's ""Presidential approval.""  

In the fall, while President Obama was on the campaign trail, he ate breakfast at Pamela's.  He loved the crepe-style pancakes so much, he asked Klingensmith and Cohen to prepare a Memorial Day breakfast at the White House for him and dozens of American troops!  Now, that's a good pancake!

I've sampled just about everything on the breakfast menu and, after eight years of patronage, my favorite is still the strawberry hotcakes.  These thinly poured crepes are laid flat, then rolled around a delicious combination of strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream, topped off with a nice dab of whipped cream to truly send your sugar levels through the roof.  They're simple, delicious and just enough not to feel ""stuffed.""

The egg and omelet plates come with home fries (chunky sliced potatoes with what appears to be approximately 1/4 small white onion and a 1/2 lb of butter per serving) and your choice of toast.   The spinach and feta omelet with rye is a decent combination.  But as a warning, these plates are not for the weak.  

For smaller appetites, they do offer fresh fruit bowls, egg white plates and a variety of a la carte items.  

The space is typical of older Walnut Street buildings with typical diner flare - simple painted brick with tables bolted to the walls.  On weekends, the room get's pretty cramped.  (A note to parents with small children: if you have large strollers, it may be a good idea to either leave them in the car or ensure they pack neatly in the corner.)  If you get there around 11:00 a.m. the wait can run you about 30 minutes or more, and there's literally one small bench to sit at while inside.  Weekday crowds are much lighter.  

Parking can be found on the street, or in the metered parking lot located behind the building.  There's no need to feed street meters on Sundays.  

All in all, this diner is a classic.  It's managed to outlive a lot of other local businesses while the larger corporate chains have moved on the street.  Perhaps it's the presidential influence, perhaps because it's ""cash only,"" but I think it's because the food is good, down-home cooking."
"PA","Great place for breakfast! Love the crepes and corn beef hash. They don't take credit cards so bring cash. Parking can be tough. Wish they would expand a bit. Great food and service!"
"PA","Wow I couldn't even eat all my bacon cheese omelette, home fries, and rye toast, and it still kept me full from 11, when I had brunch, to 9PM!  Usually I hate homefries, but these were great!  I think I can only go here like once a year though, to prevent my heart from exploding."
"PA","ooooooohhh-bama had the right idea by ordering the pancakes.  they're unbelievable...  strawberries wrapped in thin rolls of buttery goodness swimming in cream.  eff yeah!  decadent and down-right delicious.  

my breakfast date raved about the corned beef hash, stating that it was quite possibly the best she's ever had (and she orders it every time we go out for breakfast).

if i'm going to put pamela's into the regular rotation, i going to have to seriously start running more."
"PA","Great portions, homey service, homey atmosphere, reasonable prices. Classic."
"PA","Been to the one in Sq. Hill were there is often a line in the morning on nice weekend days. I've only been there when there was no line and I despise myself each time I finish my food thinking ""I could have gone home and put extra scoop of lard on my eggs and it would have cost less than 1/4 of what I payed at Pamela's""."
"PA","Best breakfasts in the Pittsburgh area.  Just make sure to bring cash - they don't take credit."
"PA","Yes, the line runs out the door but you better believe it is worth the wait.  We had a table of three and we waited no longer than 10 minutes.  The chocolate chip banana pancakes are heavenly!! Everything comes out quick, fast and in a hurry which is imperative when you get into this place and your mouth starts drooling over your neighbors' meals.  The coffee is just so-so but honestly who cares in this case.  Enjoy!!"
"PA","Definitely a great place to go if you've had a long night of drinking. They even have a special called the ""Morning After Breakfast"". I found the food greasy, and the pancakes, I wish they had a more regular style. But it's a great place to meet up and catch up with friends! It is cash-only, btw."
"PA","Pamela's is an East End institution.  Let's face it: if you've grown up, went to school or currently live in the area, you've probably spent a Sunday devoring forkfuls of Pamela's unique and delicious brand of pancake.  They are thin, crepe-like a little on the greasy side (in a good way). Quick service make up for the long lines.  Weekend specials are a must have.  My favorite is  the chocolate chip banana pancakes.  There is no place like Pamela's, anywhere."
"PA","I am not a pancake person and I absolutely adore their pancakes. Their other food is just as good if not better. Pamela's is a true gem. Breakfast is easy to make, but hard to do right. They exceed my expectations almost every time."
"PA","Pamela's is an institution in Pittsburgh.  I tend to be more of a savory eater than a sweets guy, but this place does really well on both.  On the savory side, Pamela's makes very competent omelets and gives plenty of options on egg whites only/eggbeaters.  The most famous aspect of their savory foods is the ""hash browns"" which have some spices/herbs that almost taste like  a super mild and buttery Indian Masala.  They are really really great--ask for them to make them extra crispy.  On the sweet side, their crepe-esque pancakes are delicious.  As mentioned, I am not much of a sweets guy, but after my omelet, I do enjoy sneaking a bite or two off of the edge of my wife or child's buttery, mapley pancakes.  

In Shadyside, don't be surprised to see Lynn Swann, and expect to wait for a table on a Saturday or Sunday."
"PA","My favorite breakfast, ever. The portions are a good size. Crepe style pancakes, fried eggs and homefries are great.  Actually, everything is great.  I particularly recommend the strawberry pancakes.   

Yes, you will stand in line in the cold for a while and it is cash only.  But it is oh so tasty.  Pamela's is probably what I miss most about Pittsburgh."
"PA","Some of the best breakfast you'll find.  The crepe pancakes are unique and good.  Everything comes in large-but-reasonable portions, and everything is reasonably priced.  The service is fast and friendly.  The line is understandably long at times.

The secret to the crepe pancakes, and the potatoes, is a *lot* of butter and/or oil.  They aren't really very healthy choices.  Pamela's only has mixed fruit jelly for some reason, as something tasty doesn't fit the budget?  

That said, you don't order fried potatoes and pancakes as health foods, and one can forgive them the mixed fruit.  5 stars, because you're not going to find a better breakfast-only place."
"PA","We were visiting Pittsburgh and decided to try out Pamela's for breakfast due to all the great reviews.  Either their aren't many good breakfast joints or people have a very different taste there.  We found the food to be greasy and not particularly good.  I like the idea of thinner crepe style pancakes, but these just don't taste good.  On top of it all, the coffee was horrible.  

Try DeLuca for a diner experience or Crepe Parisiennes for a good crepe and coffee instead."
"PA","Oh my lord!!! If Pamela's had existed (in any of its Pittsburgh incarnations: Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, Oakland, Millvale, the Strip, and most recently Mt. Lebanon), I  NEVER, EVER woulda left my hometown...I mean, what would that unturndownable job offer from my company's headquarters in CT have meant when I could have remained a homie downing pancakes or omelets or tasty lunch items (ah, but when you do get lunch at Pamela's, however wonderful, I guarantee you that you'll eye the pancakes of other diners that if said diners snapped you with their cell cameras, you'd be ridiculed on You Tube within minutes---cast in the unenviable role as gluttonness (gluttoness?)!!!

I've stood in line at Pamela's, I've turned in my name with my ""party"" and gone off to fetch coffee a few doors down to pretend for awhile that I wasn't starving, yet the past few times I had the pleasure of sitting down (""Please seat yourself""--that is what the sign read) immediately.  What a luxury!  Of course, the most recent of these times  (four of them, not that I counted--on two different trips: May, 2008, and July, 2008) occurred between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on weekdays.

Okay: two more things.  1) Pamela's cash register displays a sign: Cash Only...so don't try to give 'em a check, debit or credit card.  Have some $$ ready...

2) Craig B.,  I must ask: what are ""honks of butter""?"
"PA","Pancakes!  What can I say, but pancakes, pancakes, and more pancakes!  Because I'm a type-1 diabetic, I have to plan before and after if I eat a meal here!  Pump that insulin, Susan, pump!  I have to watch the carbs when I eat here.  But Pamela's has the best pancakes in Pittsburgh!  

But if for some reason my BGs are acting wacky--and believe me, they do--there are plenty of other dishes to order here.  I like their eggs, including plain ol' scrambled eggs and fried eggs.  The coffee here is decent, but if you order during off-hours, it can be a little burnt.  Yes, the wait times here are legendary, but if ya want eggs or cakes, this place is it!"
"PA","You guys...oh no, but I think this place was bought out! I walked by and saw a sign about ANOTHER waffle place coming soon. Ugh.

That being said, yeah, I love this place. I am such a fan of the salmon crepe with creme fraiche. God, so good. I can now say that having been to France, this place is pretty legit!

My only complaint is that I don't really get very full eating here. And it's kind of pricey for not getting you full. But whatever! Delicious. I really hope it's not closed."
"PA","I made my second trip here with my family of 6. Everyone loved it and we went back for another round 3 days later. I was here 2 years previously and it was just as amazing. I had a breakfast and a desert crepe and was very satisfied with them. Place is very small but comfortable and pleasant, with an amazing staff.

I will be back when I am in town."
"PA","Cash only. Cute place, good crepes, good coffee."
"PA","CP is a pretty chill spot in Shadyside.  It's located on a side street off Walnut.  The main business is in a basement which is sorta dark, kinda  cool.  You can see the chefs making the food in front of you.  Pretty neat overall.  

Crepes galore.  We had the nutella with chocolate and the veggie crepe with eggs.  Both items were fantastic.  Since we weren't quite feeling the darky basementy vibe on an otherwise gorgeous spring day, we sat outside the restaurant on one of their tables, which was definitely a nice touch to the restaurant.  The service for the most part was good: I was kind of annoyed by how slow it takes to order and cook these dishes.  I noticed that there are only 2 stations to make the crepes.  They'd certainly benefit from an expansion.  Lines get long, wait time can be significant (prob had a 30-40 min lag from when we stepped into the building to when we finally got served), but it's worth it if you have the time.

Cash only.  I'll probably be back.  Check it out."
"PA","Cash only. We love their Crepes. I don't like latta that much. It is good experience."
"PA","Really delicious crepes! I come here all the time and I love it.  The woman behind the counter always remembers my usual order.

Things to know before going: Cash only, order before sitting, and come during odd hours if you can.  It's a very busy establishment in a small location, but I normally go for late lunch on weekdays and have no problem at all getting a table right away or my food coming out quickly. I avoid Saturday mornings here."
"PA","Boom! I love this place and I'm a 6'3"" man with an appetite! Every time people want to go I think great crepes and Ill be hungry right after I eat but damn I am wrong with this place.   Breakfast crepe is my choice but they all look amazing. This place fills up fast so get in line order and grab a table. EAT!"
"PA","Wait, how have I not reviewed Crepes Parisiennes?

I first fell in love with crepes in my early teenage years, when a crepe shop opened up in my hometown of State College. Yes, the town that is best known for its love of football and binge drinking once had a restaurant that sold crepes that were practically transcendent, stuffed with anything you could imagine. Not surprisingly, it didn't last long, and my heart broke when it closed and I could only get my crepe fix on my yearly family vacations to Disney World.

In my sophomore year of college, I studied abroad in Italy, and rediscovered my crepe obsession when I found them in a British-style pub. A trip to Paris for four days had me eating the simple street version each day for breakfast. And then I returned to State College, crepeless and sad. How excited was I when I moved to Pittsburgh and found Crepes Parisiennes? I don't even think I need to answer that question.

These are GOOD crepes. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The topping list is unfortunately very limited. They don't have many veggies, they only have one type of cheese, and they don't have bacon for your breakfast crepe or strawberries for your dessert crepe. Still, you can't really go wrong with any of the combinations.

I came back to State College and tried the new crepe shop in town, and it sucked. It made me realize that I totally take Crepes Parisiennes for granted. The food might be simple, but trust me when I say Pittsburgh is lucky to have it!"
"PA","So delicious and a great atmosphere. Friendly staff. I live a block away and just went to this place for the first time today. I will be back for some more savory crepes that's for sure

I have a theory that I have never had a bad experience when I had to walk down stairs to get into a restaurant, bar, bookshop or breakfast joint. The charming feel of crepes  parisiennes tucked away from the rest of Shadyside proves my theory right once again."
"PA","Like the waiter and waitress there"
"PA","I've never had a bad meal at this restaurant. The quality and consistency is excellent. The owner is the head chef, And will come to recognize you if you are a repeat customer. The ordering and seating routine is a little unusual. You stand in line and place an order and then get a number. Only then are you supposed to sit at a table. This does make sense since people cannot just sit at a table when there's a long line of people waiting to order. Just an FYI. The crapes are simple, but always good. I usually get the tomato and cheese and add an egg. The coffee is okay. I only wish they opened a little bit earlier."
"PA","Amazing crepes!

My wife and I love this place.  We often stop by and try different crepes, my favorite has to be the Russian blintz and her's is the Nutella and banana.  I highly recommend getting a Cafe Au-Lait with your crepe.  

No complaints about this cozy little creperie."
"PA","This place is great! The savory and sweet crepes are so good, it's worth the wait.  The side salad is also amazing. Service is okay but I'm not expecting a restaurant experience, just a place that serves excellent crepes and a seat to eat them at, which is exactly what I get.

I recommend any of the crepes."
"PA","The two stars are for the food only. Otherwise, negative stars would  be in effect. WHO on earth could possibly find this place worth returning to? What a completely miserable experience. The bitchy emo service obviously leaves something to be desired, then again so does the ENTIRE restaurant! Sure, melted cheese in a crepe is good. Know what else is good? ANY melted cheese from any breakfast place and Not having to endure this hell hole. I am just upset that I went there in the early part of my day and am now in a foul mood as a result. I have been in Pittsburgh a few weeks and this place is without rival the worst brunch I've ever had (PA or CA) So, the one positive thing about it IS.... it has made me appreciate every other sub par brunch I've had up until this point.  Absolutely will never return. EVEN THE Orange juice was bad. Are you kidding?"
"PA","Truly one of my favorite breakfast spots in Pittsburgh.  The crepes are always cooked to perfection and the coffee is absolutely amazing.  Inconveniences include being cash only and being very, very tiny so getting a table might require some patience on a busy weekend morning...

...but it is totally worth the wait.  The sweet crepes are my favorite, but I'm just a sucker for anything that involves fruit and nutella."
"PA","Yum! I always go to the one on Craig and it never disappoints! If im looking for something savory, the smoked salmon is the way to go. For dessert I get the white chocolate with banana- SO delicious.

The tart salad that comes with the savory crepes are light and fresh while the decadent sweet crepes are never a disappointment!

Make sure to bring cash as it's cash only!"
"PA","The crepes here are really lovely - well-portioned - and come with a classic side salad. The ambience here is unique - it feels like a well-furnished, cozy cave, rather than sitting in a Starbucks (which unfortunately is what the Craig Street location feels like!) It's very popular, but classy enough to bring a Sunday brunch date to. 

I used to come here EVERY single weekend my freshman year of college. I'm several years out of college but come back here fondly whenever I visit Pittsburgh. It's been almost ten years since I started going to this restaurant, and amazingly, the prices have only risen by a quarter (as in, 25 cents, not 25 percent) or so since I was a wee college freshman. Inexpensive with wonderful service - I only wish they had a place like this in Philadelphia!"
"PA","The food here is pretty awesome - simple, elegant (yep I think so) and with great flavor. The sweet crepes are really good, but I usually go there for brunch and although I can have a dessert for a meal, I know I shouldn't and I try to stop myself from doing so. Here at crepes, the savory crepes are so good that, the resistance isn't too difficult. 
If you are in a protein mood, the breakfast crepe (with sausage, egg and cheese) or the icelandic salmon crepe is a good idea. They are stuffed with the filling, so if you are a petite woman like me, the size is good enough for brunch or lunch. 
The chocolate-rasperry-whipped cream sweet crepes are out of this world, both white and dark chocolate. Oh, if you like coffee, their cafe au lait is AWESOME! The chocolat chaud (I learned to pronounce chaud today... I took Spanish in school, hello!) is great too. I am not huge on just chocolate, I need something else going on with it, but I like this chaud concoction. 
The service is pretty solid. I know it can get annoying waiting for a table, but I don't think the servers or management can do much about it. 
If the weather is bad, usually a good day to visit the Shadyside Crepes. Chances are you won't have a wait."
"PA","You come here for the first time, you may think you're walking into some mystery basement.  You come here with a friend who's also never been here, they may think you're taking them somewhere scary.  Thankfully, neither of those are true!  

As soon you walk in the door, you're comforted by the fact that it's just a cozy little basement restaurant!  Coming here at 2pm on a weekday, you'll also be joining the ladies who lunch, just fyi, this is Shadyside after all!  I actually got the idea to come later (after the lunch rush) because of the Yelp reviews.  Good thing I did because the ladies who lunch had taken every table except for one!

Looking at the menu, the first thing that struck me was that this wasn't a lunch place!  Most of the crepes are of the sweeter persuasion.  Which is usually a-okay with me, but I was starving for some sustenance, so I needed to go with the savory.  I choose the veggie crepe, with mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes.  The crepe itself was nice and fluffy, with a good amount of veggies in the middle.  I thought it was the perfect amount and even came with a nice side salad, which included mandarin oranges.  

Now I know a lot of you will say, why not just go for the sweet then, but I've gotta have my savory before I have my sweet.  I know, I'm a weirdo!  But, I had a little bit of my friends dark chocolate and banana crepe and it was just a delicious teaser to what will most certainly be my future dessert here!  

Hot Tip:  Cash only!  Come on off peak times because it's tiny and you'll be hard pressed to find a seat during lunch hours or Saturday/Sunday brunch."
"PA","Pompous manager hung up on me twice (!) when I called to ask about wait times.  Have never boycotted a restaurant until now.  Mediocre crepes don't entitle that sort of bush league behavior!"
"PA","Automatic five stars for serving Marriage Frères tea.  When I turned twenty one, I was living in Paris where the drinking age is much younger.  Being that the particular birthday wasn't as special there, I decided to make it special by having a tea party at Marriage Frères. Best tea I've ever had.  And here it is, in Pittsburgh though I haven't been able to find it outside of Paris since.  The crèpes are authentic and lovely and they definitely serve it up with some authentic French manners.  When you go, make sure to have tea with your meal."
"PA","I absolutely love Paris and so was glad to see that there was a crepe place near me. I've been to both locations of Crepes Parisiennes though the other on Craig Street feels less comfortable and homey than Filbert Street. There are more props up in the Filbert Street and I'm not talking about the stacks of nutella that they have. I've had both their savory (comes with side salad) and sweet crepes - which are all delicious. Not exactly like what you would get in Paris at a food stand (sugar crepe wrapped in paper) but is enough to bring back nostalgia of my visit so I am a fan. The wait has never been terrible and the staff has been friendly. I believe they are cash only which is a bit of a bummer."
"PA","Great place to have breakfast/lunch. The crepes are great and the coffee is just what you expect in an independent coffee house (excellent)! 

Each time I visit Pittsburgh I have to eat there at least once, I try to hit it twice.  Not only is the food great (not fried and fresh fruit is used when available) the atmosphere is very fun for all ages.

Be sure to take a pocket full of quarters though, Pittsburgh has cash only parking meters. The meters on Craig St. are 1 hour max but, a quarter does buy you half an hour."
"PA","I love it here. It's so cute inside and so French. I honestly don't know how ""French"" it actually is because I've never been to France, but from what I imagine France to be like, it's French. 

The crepes, sweet or savory are delicious!! I think I prefer the sweet ones. Anything with nutella is so good. It's a good place to go for brunch with a friend. I can't wait to go when I get home again.

The wait staff is really friendly and you can watch them make crepes too! It's cool how they do it. I give props because I tried making crepes before.. and it's really hard to get it nice and thin.

I like how the seating works too because you order and then sit down.. but sometimes there's not enough seats so that's an issue, but the staff knows that and won't make your food until you have somewhere to sit so it's not like you're standing around with food and nowhere to sit."
"PA","Absolutely delicious! Love the Icelandic smoked salmon crepe and the Nutella crepe. However, they are almost never open and the older gentleman (who I assume to be upper management) can be quite rude!

I have been there a few times and have no problem with the younger servers at all, who have actually been extremely pleasant and friendly. My biggest complaint is the manager/owner who literally hung up on me not but five minutes ago!! Had it not been for him, I would have given it 4 stars.

If you don't mind potentially rude service, I would recommend giving it a try. On the other hand, sometimes it's not worth it."
"PA","Love it, love it, love it. From sweet to savory, Crepes Parisiennes has what you want. I've hit them up for both breakfast and lunch and have left feeling like I've eaten an appropriate food for the time of day.

I love their breakfast crepe. They lightly fry the exterior giving it a nice, crispy outside and stuff it full of sausage, sharp cheese and egg. I've heard people complain about the authenticity of the side salad but, come on, who cares? The crepes are authentic enough, the salad is an afterthought and is still delicious, authentic or not.

Their sweet crepes are all balanced nicely. I've had their Gnutella crepe and their ""french toast style"" berry crepe. Both were delicious and came with a generous dollop of their homemade whipped cream.

As if their crepes weren't enough, they also do a killer cafe au lait. It's served in an authentic French fashion, in a handleless bowl and comes with a generous circle of white, velvety foam. The beverage is a little on the hot side, which is usually a no-no when it comes to good coffee, but I let it slide because they still pack it full of flavor.

This place gets packed on the weekends yet the service has always been impeccable. They even bring my dessert crepe out after my meal!"
"PA","Well, to start, crepes aren't a Parisian concept.  They are solely a Brittany thing!  Therefore, the fact that this chain of restaurants carries a name like Crepes Parisiennes is pretentious.  That aside, the crepes are okay, nothing special.  I've had much lighter (crepes here were a bit heavier than they should be) and more authentic crepes elsewhere.  The other thing I do not like about this place are their hours. They are closed by 4pm and on Mondays, and stop serving savory crepes at 3pm???"
"PA","I really do enjoy stopping by the walnut location every week or so.  The French Breakfast tea with a savory crepe and salad is a great way to start a weekend.  While there's a huge list of crepes made-to-order, they're also willing to make you anything you can think of, as long as they have the ingredients.  Plus, it's underground, which just completes the aesthetic of a french crepe shop, where you sit amongst the sacks of flour to eat your crepe."
"PA","After walking by this place what felt like a million times, I was so excited to get to try this place.  I knew the weird quirks (long lines, no sitting until you have ordered, cash only, etc.) and yet was so excited to get in and try the food.  Unfortunately, however, despite the hype, the crepes just weren't great.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, but just good.  The plates and silverware were plastic, the servers were rude, and there was no such thing as atmosphere.  I could be convinced to go back and give it another try if a friend wanted to check it out, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it.... it wasn't that good."
"PA","We went here on Saturday morning.  To explain our devotion to this place, I should say that we drove down from Butler in order to get our crepes fix before our friend's early afternoon wedding.  You see, we used to go here every Friday after our first (and last) class of the day in college.  It was/is a mild obsession- a love affair of sorts.

When we got here just before 10:00, we saw that it wasn't open yet.  It was slightly odd that we stood outside until 10:15 before they opened the door.  I think that instead of making customers wait, they should just open the restaurant later, but whatever.

We walked downstairs and got in line at the register.  I was so happy to see that nothing had changed- I ordered the mixed veggie crepe with soytang sauce, and a nonfat cafe au lait.  They only accept cash, so come prepared.  I paid, took our number, and sat down.  The space is really small, so it does fill up, but it's perfectly cozy.  Our crepes were as good as ever, and including my coffee drink, my bill came in at just over $10.00.

The owner is very friendly, and normally behind the crepe maker.  This is a great place to have brunch or dessert- they also have sweet crepes (Nutella and banana is my favorite)- so be sure to check it out. It's right off of Walnut Street, so you can easily stop in before or after an afternoon of shopping."
"PA","A very unique breakfast place with great crepes (and tons of different kinds), at really decent prices.  It vaguely reminds me of Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans, in that it's just crepes and a drink...there's nothing else on the menu (at the Cafe Du Monde, it's beignets and a drink).  

Here are some other things I like about this place:

- No disgraceful uniforms for employees, or anything resembling a uniform
- No over-the-top ""Frenchness"" (it's Pittsburgh for Christsake)...with the obvious exception of a 3-4 foot Eiffel Tower
- you can watch them cook the crepes while you wait, which is both entertaining and you can see how fresh everything is
- the crepes are delicious, and cooked quickly and perfectly, with different oil/sauce choices 

What I didn't like was:
- the regular coffee isn't brewed fresh (less than 30 minutes), I think because the staff was too busy.  Any serious coffee drinkers will know the results.
- Its small, and can only hold 30 people according to the government.  You order first, then take your seat, which means you wait at the counter until someone gets up and leaves.  As a result, the staff does this thing where they pretend not to see you until a table opens up.  I understand, I do, but some courtesy, even phony courtesy, would be nice.
- Its not unlike eating breakfast in someones basement.

Still, those crepes are really damn good.  I'll go back soon."
"PA","The breakfast crepe with béchamel sauce is the best crepe on the planet! I have made many a trip to Pittsburgh under the guise of visiting my boyfriend.  Little did he know that I was really taking the 4.5 hour flight from San Francisco to have three or four of the best crepes ever created. 

As I said before, the Breakfast Crepe is the best. It has egg, cheese, breakfast sausage and your choice of one of a few different sauces (the béchamel is the best). The BF likes his crepes on the sweeter side, so he enjoys the nutella and banana. The savor crepes are served with a light salad with mandarins oranges and a citrus vinaigrette while the sweet crepes have whipped cream.  

Seriously, this place is amazing. If you live in the Pittsburgh, or are visiting you are doing yourself a disservice by not treating yourself to this absolutely fabulous, terrific, superb, and wonderful restaurant. No joke...now that the BF has graduated and no longer lives in Pittsburgh, I have thought about flying over just to eat at Crepes Parisiennes."
"PA","Closed on Monday's? And closed 5/30 to 6/1? Wow. The prices on the menu don't seem that bad. But i still cant get over the fact there closed on Mondays. There is a sign posted ""help wanted"" so if anyone reads this and needs a job check this place out. And tell them to open on Mondays. BOOOOO, if they weren't closed I would have never found Square Cafe."
"PA","French crepes are not the easiest food item to prepare and I certainly wasn't expecting Cordon Bleu quality. That said, I found the crepes to be overly thick and the filling, while tasty, too skimpy and thus overpowered by the crepes wrap. But it was the attitude of the owner that turned me off the establishment. I was in Pittsburgh visiting a relative with terminal cancer at the nearby hospital ; she had requested a breakfast crepes so I found Cafe Parisiennes through Yelp. We were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours. The sign said the Cafe opened at 10:00AM, which was when we arrived. We could see staff inside and asked if we could come in. The owner very curtly informed us they were still closed and might be ready ""in ten minutes"" or so. After another ten minutes, we asked if we could wait inside because of the cold. Again the owner was brusque and not at all apologetic for being 20 minutes late opening - on a busy Saturday morning!! When I tried to engage him while giving my order, I found him to be taciturn and argumentative; it was clear his young staff were feeling very uncomfortable watching the exchange. This is not the kind of attitude for anyone in a service business and I would definitely not recommend this establishment to anyone."
"PA","Love Crepes Parisiennes"
"PA","Fantastic savory and sweet crepes.  The light and very tasty crepes are served with a small salad topped with mandarin oranges and a champagne vinaigrette.  I have tried the salmon with creme fraiche, ham and cheese with their soytang sauce and plain butter with sugar.  

The place gets a bit crowded around noon and they have a pretty strict policy about ordering before you choose a seat.  Also, they only take cash (crepes run $7-9 plus $2 drinks).

They may have some mildly unpleasant/unpopular 'rules' but I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here and plan on returning."
"PA","This place is located in my favorite Walnut St.I just love walking in this place and enjoying the good vibes.And we came to this place for brunch and ordered veggie crepes.

  The place was small and completely packed. And their service was slow,i blame it on the crowd. The crepe was like paper,but it totally dissolved in your mouth. The lightest brunch ever!

  If you hate eating heavy meals,then this is the place for you.The place somehow reminded me of old European movies,with the old round tables and wooden chairs arranged very close to each other and to add a cherry to the cake, this was a house converted into a restaurant.

 I would love to go back here to try the Desert crepes :) 

-Smriti"
"PA","I've been to Crepes Parisiennes twice now (Filbert St location). I had a fantastic meal there this morning.

The biggest problems about the place are that it's cash only and it's quite small inside. I agree with others -- the seating system is pretty odd.  We had no wait getting a table for two this morning though. It's probably best to go in smaller groups. A larger group was ahead of us, and I think they were still waiting for a table even after we got our food (btw, we got our food VERY quickly).

I HIGHLY recommend the savory crepes. They're simply fantastic -- very flavorful and just the right consistency. The salad and dressing that accompany the crepe are very tasty as well. I've also tried the sweet crepes -- they're also good, but for me, they don't compare to the savory ones.

Bottom line for me: I prefer to go here with only one other person, and I plan to order a savory crepe every time I go back (with cash in-hand)!"
"PA","The crepes here are good. They are tasty and they have a variety. 

However, the crepes are extremely over price. So over price that I cannot afford a drink.

Finally, the staff is extremely rude and LOVES to make loud examples of people not familiar with their system. I've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff."
"PA","There are two locations, one just off Walnut Street in Shadyside and one on Craig Street in north Oakland.  The hours are quite limited, but I like the French neighborhood cafe vibe. 
The crepes and coffee are really good, and they have a great selection of French tea.  The place is quite hectic, however.  As everyone said, wait in line to order, then get a table.  I have been in both locations many times, and it has never been a problem, though it does seem a bit weird at first. 
 As for the service, it seems that their attitude is to give any rudeness you give them right back.  Be polite, and they will treat you accordingly."
"PA","I must admit the crepes here are quite tasty, very reminiscent of ones I have had in France and I especially appreciate the fresh green salad that accompanies some.

That said, their seating system is quite confusing upon the first visit.  They won't take your order unless there is an open table.  Makes sense, unless there are clueless people in front of you who had half their party sit at the last open table... gridlock.

Anyhow, quite a lovely experience but I'm not sure it was enough to lure me back to the dark side, also known as Walnut st (or Shadyside in general), all too often."
"PA","Cash only. It's a bit pricey for crepes, but it's great to have the restaurant to fulfill crepe cravings :)"
"PA","The best place for breakfast in Shadyside, especially if you don't feel like being drowned in food at Pamela's. There might be a wait, and don't try to go with more than two others (really, make it a date), but it's so clean and nice and relaxing. The crepes are excellent, I always get the breakfast crepe (sausage and egg) with their soytang sauce, but the dessert crepes (chocolate and orange! banana!) are also delicious. The little salad of greens and orange slices that comes with the savory crepes is a great addition. Go here when you're feeling cosmopolitan."
"PA","I'm no crepe connoisseur, but I did try quite a few places. I waited Yelping this place until I got a chance to try San Francisco's well-known crepe place. Whereas the SF place wins on their ambiance category, this Pittsburgh gem has a way better quality crepe. The taste here is by far more superior than any other places.  Be prepared to wait in line for half an hour+ on a weekend, but I can assure you that your patience will be well rewarded with a great plate of crepe - regardless of what kind you order!

P.S. - BRING CASH. They do not accept credit cards."
"PA","There is not much to say about this place.  The crepes are wonderful.  The savory crepes are generally accompanied by a salad of sorts.  The quality is great, certainly comparable to anything else I have had in the United States, and pretty close to what I have had in Paris.  One limitation, I did go to a place in Key West of all places that used some sort of Buckwheat or whole wheat batter for their savory crepes that was really really great.  It would be great if Crepes Parisiennes could adapt that.  My only other issue is that the place is a tad pricey."
"PA","These are the best crepes I've had in Pittsburgh and several other big cities (D.C., Phila., Chicago).  The guy who makes the crepes is a true expert and watching him whip up dozens of crepes is so much fun! I get the egg and cheese crepe with added mushrooms and order with the garlic oil base.  They serve all of the savory crepes with a tiny side salad with mandarin orange slices.  Although it's small, its really a nice addition and the dressing is so good I dip my crepe in it."
"PA","The crepes served by this establishment might very well be the culinary embodiment of a mind-exploding, toe-curling, orgasm.  I say, ""might be"" because on my recent (and last) trip there I didn't have an opportunity to sample them.  In fact, I didn't eat anything at all.

Please let me explain.

The restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of Walnut Street.  Customers are expected to wait in a line that stretches from the entrance, through the main dining area, to a counter where the crepes are ordered and cooked.  It's a horrendous setup for multiple reasons.  

First, there aren't many tables.  When I went there on a Saturday morning, there were at least 20 people standing in line for the ten or so small tables.  Second, the restaurant expects you to wait in line, standing next to tables of patrons who are eating their food, until a table becomes free.  At that point, the woman at the counter takes the next order, a man begins preparing the crepes, and the front of the line is seated while everyone else continues to wait.  Those who have waited long enough, are finally able to sit, while hungry and impatient diners-to-be stand next to their table and wait some more.

It's a horrible atmosphere, and not one conducive to a pleasant dining experience.

The dining space is poorly designed, so that the line of waiting patrons snakes directly though the middle of the cramped dining area.  Which means that when you are waiting, you are continually bumped by servers shuttling food to the tables and dirty dishes back to the kitchen.  When you are eating, you are likely to: 1) have a bunch of hungry people staring at you eat, waiting for you to leave your table, so that they may be seated; and/or 2) have a standing person's ass within a few inches of your head.  What a great dining atmosphere!

What's all the more annoying is the lackadaisical work ethic of the people who prepare the crepes.  More than once during my wait, the man making the crepes just stood around, not making any food, waiting for another table to open, so a party's order could be taken, and he could then prepare the next order.  

After waiting 15-20 minutes while hungry, becoming increasingly annoyed at being bumped at least 2 dozen times by serves traversing the line, and then seeing the owner stop making food until another order was taken, I said to myself, ""enough of this nonsense"".

My party and I left to go to another restaurant.  I've not eaten any crepe in the world that would justify a long wait under such annoying circumstances, and I will not be back."
"PA","Nice cozy underground restaurant that serves crepes and a great Cafe au lait.  They have plenty of sweet crepes and a few savory ones.  They could add a couple more savory ones, but otherwise I would definitely eat there again."
"PA","I travel to Pittsburgh pretty often, and the owner who cooks the crepes recognizes my wife and me every single time we're there.

The crepes are excellent, the prices are more than reasonable, and as long as you don't go there during a peak period, it's never too crowded."
"PA","This place has delicious, delicious food.  I love eating it so much.  

On the down side, it's really kind of a pain to get in there.  The lines are long, and the seating is not plentiful.  That's after you fight for parking.  

As tasty as the crepes are, I usually decide it isn't worth the bother and go somewhere else."
"PA","Crepes Parisiennes in Shadyside is absolutely scrumptious and many people agree because this place and the Craig Street (Oakland) location are always busy.  It's the perfect place for a light brunch or lunch with a couple people (whoever since it's casual... friends, family, potential significant other, etc.), but not so much for large groups since seating is extremely limited and you have to place your order first (and wait for an available table if there aren't any).  If you do have to wait, you can spend some of that time looking right into the small kitchen area and watch as your crepe is made.  My favorite is their [savory] salmon crepe.  Mmm mmm mmm!!  The sweet crepes are too big for me to eat alone so if there's a group consensus, we'll order one and split it.  (Oh, Nutella!)  Random, but I'll also add that I like how I can pour my ice water from their pitcher rather than get it from a little tab under the lemonade spout thing on a fountain drink machine."
"PA","This place is great!  I love the crepes, especially the Chocolate Banana.  I always take guests here when they come to visit, because they're always impressed.  Their hot chocolate is amazing!  I like the French theme, but it does need a little updating.  Chairs are uncomfortable.  Service isn't that great.  But, the crepes are so good that it doesn't matter."
"PA","I had a salmon crepe here & it was delicious - broke me out of the habit of mostly eating dessert crepes. The only downside is that they only take cash... but there is an ATM just down the street. This is a great place to meet up with an old friend or acquaintance."
"PA","The food is amazing, which is what causes the common wait however its definately worth the wait. The vegetarian crepe is one of the most amazing meals you could ask for the tomatoes are slightly spicy and the soytang dressing compliments the crepe well. This is one restaurant I doubt I would ever tire of. I would often go with friends order a savory crepe and split a sweet one with a friend!

My mouth is watering just thinking of the yummy food!"
"PA","They are unique to Pittsburgh and the crepes are outstanding.  The owner is a nice guy who made a point to say hello to some guests who I was with this morning who frequent much more than I do.  The place was packed at 2 PM on a saturday I can't imagine it being comfortable on a Sunday or Saturday AM.  The wait staff in general is off and I'm really not sure why.  I mean sure they are busy, but in these types of non-franchise ""bohemian"" joints usually the 20 somethings are exceptionally nice.  Oh, well maybe this is part of the authentic Frecnch experience.  You do feel the need to eat quickly because of  the other customers eyeing you up for the precious few seats available.  Outside of the venue and service the crepes are the best I've ever had in Pittsburgh and if the service and venue was better this  could easily be four or maybe even five stars.  I had the smoked salmon with creme fraiche' and it was perfect.  It had great quality ingredients and was truly delicious.  A friend had the ham and cheese which was also excellent and another had  just a  traditional crepe with maple syrup.  This was also a smashing success.  I think the owner needs to share with his young staff some of the hospitality he showed my friends, but I'm guessing they don't feel this is necessary since they seem to be at capacity already."
"PA","Oh man, I miss this place so much!  I never knew what a treat a crepe restaurant was until I didn't have it anymore.  It's on a side street off of Walnut, in a small basement place with old stone walls. DON'T SIT DOWN BEFORE ORDERING! The owner will get mad.

I love the atmosphere, the mean owner, the cute waitresses, the big coffee mugs, and my favorites crepes are the 'savory', not 'sweet' ones.  I think my Perfect Day would begin here with an egg and sausage crepe with olive oil sauce.

It does get crowded. Go before 10 am or after 2 pm. Not open for dinner.  The newer crepe place on Craig street is nice too, more collegey. 

Man I miss this place."
"PA","Crepes Parisiennes does what it does very well.
The crepes are tender and buttery and the savory ones come with a side salad with mandarin oranges and a house vinaigrette. My favorites are the salmon or banana crepes. 

I can never tell when it's open though. Often I go, and they are closed for some inexplicable reason. Or they're super crowded..."
"PA","Oh my goodness-- best crepes ever! they have a chocalate banana crepe that is one of the best deserts out there!! or maybe you want to eat a little healthier-- the egg and cheese and the ham and egg crepe are both GREAT choices for a protein breakfast!! So So Good! The have a nice little shop and everyone is friendly-- also of great importance--very fast, speedy service but fresh food !!
A + check it out next time you are in Shadyside!"
"PA","Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the ""unspoken house rules"": 

1. Order first (do not try and sit down).
2. Wait for your food while standing.
3. Find a seat (if one is available).

Under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.

My wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.

Little did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: ""you can either sit there or there"", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the ""unwritten rules"" to us.  An ""excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down"" would have sufficed.

So, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money."
"PA","My favorite crepe place! Another location on Craig Street. Yay!

They only take cash though and usually have strange hours. Plus it's packed at peak hours on weekends. 

Salmon dishes or anything with nutella is amazing. They also have Orangina!"
"PA","Cafe au lait, in a bowl/cup! Look ma, no handle! Honestly, and I know it's such a little little thing, but this is the big reason I love Crepes Parisiennes. That and the staff, especially the guy who takes orders and always seem a little out of it but is friendly nonetheless. 

I tended towards the dark chocolate crepe with walnuts and whipped cream. Imagine it. Literally, droolingly delicious. I mean, if you're going to have breakfast at a crepe place, you might as well get ridiculous. The savory crepes are good, from what I remember of eating off friend's plates. 

Go at odd hours, and not breakfast or brunch time on weekends because it gets packed. And bring cash."
"PA","Fantastic crepes. Really. The savory ones (like the smoked salmon), the sweet ones, all of them are just plain great. The restaurant is actually a tiny basement of a Shadyside-style home. They try hard to make it feel like France by making it narrow, crowded, lacking air conditioning, and cash-only. Those are the drawbacks, but it adds to the authenticity I suppose. Also, they have Evian and Orangina, which is always nice. If you need breakfast - can't beat the crepes here. Go, eat, have fun, forget where you are for a while."
"PA","dear god, this place is heavenly. i usually like the dessert stuff, but that soytang with tomato and cheese could make a convert out of me. the side salad is NOT a throwaway. and my boyfriend HATES french stuff usually, but even he likes this place. alot. we live right around the corner from this place; can't believe our luck! and tea drinkers--this is your spot! lots of fun mags, too."
"PA","Ham and cheese crepe with bechamel sauce, side salad with a tangy champagne vinaigrette and mandarins on top. Add to a perfect cup of hot chocolate or orangina, and it's the most delicious breakfast/brunch meal you could imagine. As a Pittsburgher for 5 years, I spent much of my 2 years in Shadyside as a regular here - often taking new people and having large brunches with friends and students. 

When going, keep in mind you'll be waiting in a line to order- the line does pause until more tables open up, so be patient. It is quick though and WELL worth the wait!"
"PA","The breakfast crepes with the soytang sauce are enough to drag me out of bed on the weekend that's how good they are.   And let's not even talk about all the sweet crepes full of chocolately goodness that you can order."
"PA","I have been shopping at EB Pepper since it was in the Ross Park Mall (Well over 15 years ago!!) I have travelled to many cities, both in the US and abroad,  and I can honestly say that hands down this is my favorite boutique--no sloppy looks here, feminine, well-made, CHIC and gorgeous clothing--i even tried to shop here pregnant--If you need a cocktail dress or a rehearsal dinner dress OR an amazing suit..i just wish they would have a website...
Love this place, always will!"
"PA","I bought my first pair of designer denim here over 5 years ago, and have been hooked ever since.  7 For All Mankind Bronze Swarovski Crystal Pockets.  Fantastic experience."
"PA","I have not been to a boutique where the staff was more friendly or helpful.  I love how they treated everyone like a valued customer, even a humble college student like me at the time.  The sales ladies there really knew their jeans and made excellent recommendations on which jeans would fit my figure the best.  This place is one of the things I miss most since moving out of Pittsburgh."
"PA","*For the bar

While looking for places to have Easter brunch, I saw the Sunnyledge appear several times in my searching. They no longer do easter brunch, but they do have their martini bar - which many people seem to rave about. I should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old, but I threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a Friday evening.

Just getting off work, I came alone. The location is a historical landmark, a mansion built in 1889, and is the reason they deserve their single star. The mansion, from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept. The walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass. The furniture is elegant but not stuffy, and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted. The bar is rather small, housing four 2-seat tables, a 4-top, and about 8 spaces at the bar. Behind the bar, light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles. The top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughout.

I browsed the martini menu, not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter, or too far from a martini(tequila, cointreau, and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that Jose Cuervo on your top shelf doesn't send a good impression of your margarita). I stuck with the classic, then, and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish. 

It was made quickly and without love, shaking instead of stirring, and putting it in an un-chilled glass. Not that there was much to love, while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range, the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel. Banker's Club is the gin of choice here, and Burnett's flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu. The martini came(Not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus.

I found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. How much did my room temperature Banker's Club cost? A cool $9.

It appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. If you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a cab to Walnut street. At least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink."
"PA","So I always heard good things about Sunnyledge but never stopped in until I went there my junior year at CMU. Biggest mistake of my first 2 years. And yes, I had a fake ID so I could get into most places. 

Well, Sunnyledge is kind of a bed and breakfast type lodging but on Fridays from 6-8, they have their happy hour. 1/2 price Martinis. These martinis are unbelievable. They are pretty strong and taste delicious. They have so many different martini's on their menu so just choosing one/two/three/four will take a bit of time to decide each time you re-order.

So the martini comes in a regular martini glass. Well, you also get the leftover martini mix poured into a small glass container. They put dry ice in your glass before they pour your drink so the drink actually starts to bubble and puff up whisps of smoke which is so cool. There is also a larger piece of dry ice in your glass container which keeps your extra martini cool until you're ready to drink it. 

Once your finished the first glass, you pour what's in the container into your martini glass and voila, it comes out to a second martini. Granted that these martini's are kind of expensive, on half price happy hour, you are pretty much getting 2 martini's for the price of one.

They also have a free tiny buffet appetizer where they have different things each time. I've had cheese and crackers, bruschetta, cole cuts crackers and cheese, etc..

The menu isn't too bad either. I had their duck wrap and sliders one time. The fries were different. Not bad. but not exceptional. The only issue I have with the food is that the servings are really small and aren't worth the money you spend on it but if you go there on an empty stomach and end up ordering 4 martini's (8 total drinks) then you will need to get something to eat."
"PA","All the previous reviews on here are for dining, what about the hotel? I stayed 2 nights, a Sunday and Monday. Nice hotel! It is a grand  old mansion built circa 1886 and designated an historic landmark. Definitely an old school hotel, there is internet and basic TV, rooms are spotless and quiet and speckless. The place  has a certain charm to it. If you like your hotel to be quiet, quaint and a little quirky this is the place to stay. Located next to Carnegie Mellon University and within walking distance of the University of Pittsburgh. The surrounding neighbourhood is filled with similar old well kept mansions from 1880's and makes for pleasant walking. I will return to this hotel on my next trip to Pittsburgh. Would have been 5 stars if I had my own coffee maker in the room, but the staff is always ready to being you a carafe for no charge, I just prefer to wake up and not have to dress to go for my first coffee...."
"PA","Who deleted my review of Sunnyledge?

Back in April, I met a girl for drinks at the Sunnyledge.  We had both heard good things about the place and that they had a great martini menu.  When we arrived there, however it was a different story.  We were met at the door by the hostess (I presume) who did not take our arrival kindly and seemed annoyed that we were there.

We shrugged it off and went to the bar.  The bartender was something else and it seemed as if he was on a variety of drugs. He acted as if he was on the last quaaludes in his posession and moved with a subtle grace most often reserved for Miss Universe pageant constestants.  And that's saying something.

The bartender would disappear for long periods of time, during which we would hear odd sounds coming from the kitchen.  Mostly the sounds of silverware banging around.  It was as if the hostess and bartender were throwing cutlery at each other in attempts to get us to think just what the hell was going on.  We were there for about 2 hours  and during that time saw the bartender a total of 4 times.  Most of the time he was hiding out in the kitchen.  

Even when it came time to get our check, it took about 15 minutes for him to return with my card.

Terrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place.  I have no plans on returning.

I hope this isn't deleted again, and if it is, I will make sure it's well known and will take printed copies of this and put them up around Sunnyledge and use every contact I have to get this printed in the Post Gazette and City Paper.  I have the means, I have the will."
"PA","I liked the ambience better than the food.  I went there for the first time today, for Sunday brunch ($22 per person, prix fixe).  The dining room is quite elegant as is the library in which the buffet is set out.  The ambience suggests that the year is 1900.  The waiter was very good, but they seemed to be understaffed.

The yogurt with fruit, the warm brie with strawberry, the hummus and toast, the chicken, the cinnamon pastry triangles, and the tiny eclairs were all quite good.  The quiche was cold, tiny, and not particularly flavorful.  Orange juice was served in dainty little glasses, causing anyone with a good thirst to order at least two.  The wait for the entrees was excessive -- about 25 minutes from the time we ordered them.  I got french toast and my kids got strawberry pancakes.  Both were dry and unremarkable.  I've cooked better french toast and pancakes at home, in my opinion.  We didn't try the sandwiches or salads; perhaps they're better.

Overall, it's not a bad place, but I think you can do better.  Another elegant place for lunch or brunch, but better food, is Frick Cafe.

Note: according to their own web page, http://www.sunnyledge.com/, the name of this place is ""Sunnyledge Boutique Hotel & Tea Room"".  ""Historic"" is not part of the name."
"PA","I only go here for the martinis. I've never had the food. The bar is an excellent cozy place that works for couples and groups. There is an assortment of non-traditional martinis. The prices are extremely reasonable($8 for a very generous martini) and the staff is excellent. The only sad thing is they have Hendricks gin, but never any cucumbers. The nice thing about martinis here is that they fill your glass and then give you a mini carafe of more martini in a round bowl full of ice to keep it cold."
"PA","As a non-native Pittsburgher, I would say the Sunnyledge brunch tops Grand Concourse.  Not in the quantity, but in the service and the ambience.  It's funny how often I passed by this place turning onto Fifth coming down from Wilkins, but didn't try it until my last weekend in Pittsburgh.

I came here on my last Sunday in Pittsburgh after I had posted a list of things I wanted to do before leaving.  The Sunnyledge owner offered a deal and graciously gave the 4 of us a round of mimosas.  Along with this deal, we had an incredible brunch.

The 4 of us were sat on the porch, overlooking Fifth which wasn't that loud.  The brunch came with an entree and a buffet.  I love perfectly-sized portions and this one was it.  I had a lobster club sandwich which was great.  The brunch buffet was held in a room in the lobby, which was quaint and small.  Caviar.  Small pastries.  Just the perfect balance of sweet and savory.  Even though the crowd here were a little more upscale and classy (one of the few places that I saw valet parking), I never felt that I was treated any less (I was a poor graduate student with a love of food).

The only drawback was that the tables and chairs were somewhat cramped.  I had to struggle with getting out of my chair each time to go to the buffet.  But this was a small negative compared to my experience at Sunnyledge.

I hear that Sunnyledge is known for their cocktails as well as their stay.  Next time I am in Pittsburgh, I would like to try out the boutique hotel.  But until then, I would highly recommend this brunch."
"PA","All of the staff here are super friendly, and they let me bring my dog in as a I shop (Walnut is a very dog friendly street), so I appreciate that, as we often pass by here on our walks. My favorite Gap location yet."
"PA","The guy who works here gave me the best customer service and helped me pick out my new favorite jeans. Probably the best experience I have ever had at the Gap."
"PA","I have shopped in this Gap several times. Even though the space is nice and large, I really don't believe that they receive any special product or assortment vs. all of the other local Gap stores. I think the store is worth checking out if you're shopping on Walnut Street, but I wouldn't make too much effort to shop here compared to the other local stores."
"PA","This is one of the few stores on Walnut Street that I ever walk in- it isn't too upscale for me (though it's getting there), they are one of the only stores that have a pants size that fits me PERFECTLY, and their sale rack is da bomb. Just to say upfront: I hate to shop. It's one of the worst things in the world. However, once in a while I do have an itch that I have to scratch. And this weekend was one of those times- plus I had a $100 gift card that I've held onto for almost a year. I had a good experience here: the staff was nice, the sale rack was of course good (though the regular stuff didn't tickle my fancy). Anyway, I do like this place and I probably will come back the next time I get the itch."
"PA","I had such a pleasant experience at this store, that I had to review it.  

I generally like Gap for cheap basics.  I don't care for their sportswear nor their fancier dresses--I don't think most of it is high enough quality to be appropriate for corporate or even business causal workplaces.  But for t-shirts, button-downs, shorts, jeans, leggings, and other such items for playtime or to wear at my more causal workplace, it's perfect.  I pretty much bought a new summer wardrobe for under $100 by going in on a days where most items were 40% and by using a TON of saved up rewards cards that I get monthly as a cardholder.  Plus Tuesdays offer an extra 10% off for cardholders.  Let's just say that I saved more than I spent.

What stuck out to me was that the girl--I believe her name was Georgette--who rang me up went out of her way to make sure that I got the best deal possible with all of my promotions that I could use.  It took three times as long to ring up me, but she was very patient and friendly during the process.  I actually filled out the store survey when I got home because I was so pleased!

Bonus, you can now opt to save a tree and get emailed receipts.  This will also put you on the mailing list to let you know when the sales are so if you're thrifty like I am, you can save a ton."
"PA","When I shop at Gap about once or twice a year I head straight to the back of the store since that's where the sale items are. They usually don't disappoint! My most recent visit was in April and I purchased six basic tops for $47.26 (comes out to ~$7.88 each!). The girl at the register asked if I'd like to give them my e-mail so they could send me an electronic receipt and I did. It's pretty cool that they're doing this because I usually lose my receipts and/or they end up cluttering up my purse. If you decide to opt-in for the e-receipt thing give them a secondary/junk e-mail address though because they send a ton of promotional e-mails and/or unsubscribe from them altogether."
"PA","I usually enjoy shopping at the Gap, but I recently had a really bad experience.  I went in to exchange a shirt and when I asked the orange face goblin manager if they had any more he was incredibly rude.  First, he wouldn't even look at me when I asked him a if there were any more of the shirt I wanted to exchange, and him immediately told me they did not have any of these.  Since I was in a hurry I just decided to return the shirt, then on my way out of the store I saw a whole table display of the shirt in several different colors.  The costumer service really ruined my experience."
"PA","i'm generally not one to review chains, so when i do, it's usually for customer service (or lack thereof). such is the case with this gap.

i don't even shop at gap. but the bestie and i were doing our usual shadyside rounds last weekend and he really wanted to check out the spring collection, so we dipped in.

bestie found awesome pants suitable for both work and play but they didn't have the color in his size. the friendly (and super attractive) nate immediately asked if he could call another store for us. bestie and i agreed the pants would be a wise investment, so nate began calling stores nearby and, after several minutes, found them and placed them on hold.

though i didn't look at the women's collection (like i said, i'm not a gap-goer), i did roam around the men's collection while bestie was in the fitting room and was amazed at how mostly everything was in place and cleaned up. loads of natural light also make everything even more aesthetically appealing. the only thing that would've been better was a sale. oh wait! bought three pairs of boxers for a lucky gent for only $15.95. no clothing tax in pgh = happy manda-panda."
"PA","Happy New Year!  I appreciate great small businesses and one always receives excellent attention at Leone's. For many years, I have called from a long distance to this local florist and have always been given the best attention and service. Ron knows it's important to pay attention to the details and get it right the first time. My family and friends who live in the Shadyside area know Ron is the go to florist. Call and talk because you will be happy you did !"
"PA","Used him a long time ago and to this day I still feel ripped off. Swore up and down to me he could do a job and came up short. very short. Then had the nerve to blame me.

Now he has the nerve to stay open.
Hate this place!"
"PA","After a personal call and lengthy discussion on me wanting something unique and different and not a standard vase of flowers in our school colors of white and blue, I was asked if a unique container would be ok and I said that is what I wanted unique and different, from cheerleaders to the other cheer coach, for $100. When I saw that it was a vase of a few blue and white flowers, I was furious and feel ripped off!!! The order my family placed online was so awesome!! A puppy made of flowers in a ceramic pumpkin candy dish!! It was not even $60 including se day shipping!! The photos on his website have several larger arrangements made for $65-85!!! I sent several emails with photos comparing the two and have not received a reply back!! I will be calling!
BUYERS BEWARE!!!! I guess he thought I would not see then!!"
"PA","Fast food.... NOT.

Big corporate America places only get one shot w us. We came here cause we got stuff to do, quick trip to TARGET, try to get child fed quickly and to bed on time. SO LETS STOP AT Wendy's, right? Quick?

Swing and miss. Never again."
"PA","I visisted this Wendy's often when I first started working nearby in Shadyside. But I quickly learned my lesson. I got tired of spending 20 minutes of my lunch break waiting in line. No less than 20 minutes. Every. Single. Time. The drive-thru is only slightly faster at 10-15 mins. Plus, the staff is rude. I've driven out of my way a few times to the Wendy's in Wilkinsburg just to avoid this place.

Anyway, I have no qualms with the food, as it's the same as any other Wendy's. So it's fine if you have time to kill."
"PA","Aw Wendys.. You get no love? Okay in everyones defense service is spotty. But c'mon. That frosty itself deserves atleast 2 stars :) (5 IMO)

Funny story. 1/1/14 @ 3am. We just left Southside & were driving around aimlessly looking for places to eat. At last we spot Wendys & a drive thru line wrapped around. We wait.. & wait & wait. A few cars leave & we move. & wait some more. Finally we decide to leave after realizing it'll take forever to get through the line. We drive past the window & boom.. It's dark & closed. We look at the Wendys sign which states they close at 6pm new years eve. So a line of 20 cars including us all had a dummy moment the very beginning of 2014, including our DD. haha :)"
"PA","Don't use the drive-thru. I'm not sure why I keep coming here (probably because the food is decent enough and cheap). Every time I'm here, without fail, I can expect to wait no less than 13 minutes in the drive-thru."
"PA","what is it with Wendys ?  They never get the orders right. If any of the employees would smile I would die from shock.  This review applies to many of the Wendys  that I have been to. Even in Florida.  Do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?"
"PA","Just like every other Wendy's you've been to, except with slower service! Employees show no sense of urgency. There are two cash registers inside but I've never seen more than one being used at once, no matter how long the line is. Last time I was here, it took 30 minutes from the time I took my place in line until I received my order."
"PA","In a pinch, Wendy's can do.  However, if you're in a hurry, and expect to use the drive-thru and get out, go elsewhere.  That is also a good sign, shows that the place has staying power with the constant line of people inside and outside wanting their food.  Bad thing, traffic can sometimes be snarled if there is that big of a line that it comes out onto Baum Blvd.

Quick sidenote: if you decide to use the drive-thru, be sure to have used the bathroom prior, not fun to sit there waiting when you really need to use the facilities.  It's like that long ride on the turnpike when you already passed the last rest stop for 50 miles."
"PA","I will forever remember this drive-through conversation:

Welcome to Wendy's. Can I take your order?

Yeah, I'd like a Frescuit. 

We ain't got no hashbrowns!

...um, all I want it a Frescuit. 

A'ight... I'm just lettin' you know."
"PA","This place is pretty hit or miss. On a good day, the food is fresh and delicious, and the staff is friendly and polite. On a bad day, nothing comes out the way it should and the frostys even suck. How can a Wendy's mess up a frosty? I have no clue. 

I did just discover that their morning potatoes are better than McD's hashbrown patty, an accomplishment that I did not think was possible - the crispy little polygons are spiced to delicious perfection and are a great compliment to the square (ciabatta-eqsue?) sausage muffin. Morning heartburn? Yes, but probably worth it, and also the reason Tums exist."
"PA","Perhaps it is due to my experiences in dtown Balto that I may have a skewed opinion, but anyone who tries to say that this location has shady patrons is woefully incorrect.  As of today, I have gone to this location throughout every part of the day.  Today, sunday morning, I walked into the fast food joint while half the restaurant was blocked off for prospective vibrant wendy's employees training.

their overplayed commercial promoting their breakfast, specifically their ""fresh cracked eggs cooked on a griddle"" thing, finally inspired me to wake up before noon for the first time in a while to head to wendy's for breakfast.  I got the artisan egg sandwich with sausage combo (which includes their roasted potato slices and a drink (OJ costs 80 cents extra)).  I thought that the roasted potato slices would turn out too gourmet, which i was NOT looking for.  But praise whatever you'd like me to praise, they did use a good amount of starch to give it the outside crunch reminiscent of a french fry or a tator tot.  thumbs up to that.  unfortunately, i may have come too late to get the fresh batch of sausage patties, but mine came out a bit dry.

Then why 5 stars? the 99 cent junior bacon cheeseburger.  my goodness, it could be the best 99 cent fast food item of all time.  i've ordered as many as 6 at once before, and no more than 1 was made with any type of cheese translational misregistration relative to the sausage patty substrate (did i just reveal my identity as a loser? i hope not). in layman's terms, every little cheeseburger came out constructed perfectly, with one slice of fresh tomato, crisp green lettuce, and most importantly, their bacon.

overall, i'm partially thankful to be in pittsburgh because of how near i live to this wendy's, and because pittsburgh is one of only around four metropolitan areas where wendy's currently offers breakfast. although nothing would ever match up to in n out, this is my go-to place to satiate my cravings i get as a socal fast-food junkie."
"PA","A couple blocks away from the UPMC Shadyside hospital, this was one of the better Wendy's experiences I have had.

Friendly staff working at a fast clip at the inside counter. 

I got a spicy chicken medium combo with small chili and sweet tea. I also picked up the $1 frosty keychain tag of which 0.80 goes to the Salvation Army and gets me a free mini-frosty with subsequent visits.

They didn't try to upsell me or read me the rule book when I asked for extra hot chili sauce (my favorite hot sauce of any fast food chain) and crackers like the Wendy's at home.

Food was fresh and hot. Can't ask for more from a Wendy's."
"PA","This used to be my local Wendy's back in the day and I used to frequent it a bit too regularly for the Spicy Chicken Sandwich.

I don't really recommend fast-food or chains but I have fond memories at this particular one.

Gotta luv using french fries as a fork for your frostee and seeing it partially melt around the fry."
"PA","Went here after dinner to grab a frosty but gave up after an extended wait. The cashiers were busy chatting with their friends and couldn't be bothered to help anyone in line. The location also seemed a bit sketchy; I'd avoid this one. Try Panera Bread across the street."
"PA","We order takeout here several times a month. The food is always very good, and quite plentiful for a take-out order. The quality seems pretty consistent as well. They even called me back once to double check something on the order. That was really nice. Delivery times are always good, and they're very fast on slow days. Meals in the restaurant or also high-quality. My wife and I have probably eaten here 40 times in the last five years."
"PA","Tyipical ""Chinese restaurant"" menu and flavour. Environment and service is above average, making overall experience decent."
"PA","Had a craving for Chinese the other day while I was in Shadyside and wandered into China Palace.  How this place can stay in business in an area that I consider to be more sophisticated is a real mystery.  It was just awful and the service was terrible.

I wanted to have the assorted appetizer platter, but asked if I could substitute one of the items with dumplings.  Our waiter had to ask the manager.  After much whispering, the manager came back to me and told me that I could have dumplings...then I asked if I could get the fried dumplings with that instead of steamed.   Well I was met with an outraged ""NO""!!!!  It kind of surprised me that I got this kind of reaction.  I was told that the chef would have to fry 2 dumplings just for my platter.  I looked around and there were only 2 other people in the entire restaurant.  Isn't that what they're supposed to do?  Cook food for people to eat?  I would have never asked if I thought it would be such a big deal.  

Anyway, the food was not very good.  In fact, it was awful.  

Were they having an off day?   I'm not sure they were.   There's never any reason to be rude to your patrons.  No need to ever return."
"PA","I love their vegan / vegetarian menu! The food is so good! Just remember to ask them to hold the MSG! 

Friendly service. Clean. Nice atmosphere."
"PA","LOVE this place! Super-friendly staff. Soy protein with broccoli was suh. Flippin. Good. I was with 2 meat-eaters that loved it too. Go to their website for full menu --I don't see it here on Yelp, but we got it 2 days ago.

Reviewer below is right--menu wording is a little confusing. The vegetable/tofu dishes are not necessarily vegetarian. But the vegetarian dishes are (duh). So are some of the other things (noodles, appetizers, etc.)

To summarize: It's good. Go!"
"PA","I had steamed chicken and veggies along with hot and sour soup! I would never get tired of it!"
"PA","Yinz don't know what the hell you're talking about, or order the wrong dish. 

Do yourself a favor order the Lemon Chicken with seshwan* sauce instead of lemon sauce.....Thank my later"
"PA","A good place for Chinese food, the service is good too. Also, the lunch special is a good bargain for a student. The manager is nice. The price (except lunch special) is a little higher than other places, but this is on Walnut St. so this is understandable. The suggestion is to provide more spicy foods (by ""spicy"" I mean really spicy:)."
"PA","Disgusting...The general tso that I ordered for delivery tasted like fish. I called and Verna tried to convince me that it was because I made the mistake of not requesting white meat. She then tried to tell me that they don't deep fry anything with fish. This was interesting because I am sure that the shrimp egg rollls that I ordered were indeed deep fried...in the same oil that my chicken was fried in. She told me that the delivery driver would be there in an hour to pick it up and i call and she tells me that they only way for me to get the refund is if I bring it in myself. Very rude and horrible customer service"
"PA","I have never, ever thrown food away, but I couldn't stomach this stuff. I got the pork fried rice and egg drop soup. Holy moly was that a poor decision. The rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy ""pork"". It tasted nothing like pork, or meat for that matter. I tried adding soy sauce for some kind of flavor but dear lord that didn't help. The soup was a weird creamy mess. My friend got the general tso chicken, which should generally be a safe choice. WRONG. cardboard. Cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster. Seriously we've never been so grossed out that we had to throw out $20 worth of food but that's what happened."
"PA","Not very good Chinese food here. It reminded me of a cheap college place. They give you plenty of food but it is low quality. Could have probably went to another place and paid half the price for the same meal."
"PA","Not crazy about this place. The food is subpar and definitely purchased in bulk and not the greatest quality. The atmosphere is clean and the staff is friendly so that's why I gave them a 3 star. 
Good luck."
"PA","Yuck! I  hadn't eaten here in years and it will be years until I return. The wonton soup was watery, and the wontons were inedible. I ordered pepper steak wwhich they substituted pork sparerib meat and I surmised that they didn't think I would notice. Also I think the health dept needs to perhaps male a visit;the place is dirty."
"PA","Good Chinese food is hard to find. Food is well made, priced right, and portion size was large. No real complaints. We ordered deliver which came super fast. Apparently the owners of China Palace also own Sushi Too which explains why my wife was able to order sushi over the phone even though it was not on their menu. Very Cool."
"PA","My favorite chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Clean, flavorful, close in proximity, priced right, friendly service, food comes out quickly, and they're probably the only ones open til 10pm! (since Pittsburgh is the ""city that sleeps""). The only dish I don't like and got confused with is their Walnut Shrimp. In the West Coast, it's glazed with coconut and its supposed to be sweet, but in this restaurant, its salty and does not have any coconut flavor, so I don't order it anymore. And I wish they delivered to the downtown area."
"PA","This is my favorite place in the area, and I would eat here everyday if I could. Their vegan options are extensive and amazingly delicious. The won-ton soup is vegan friendly too, at least that's what the server told me. Portion sizes are generous, the soy protein is to die for and the price is right. This place is a little piece of heaven for vegetarians and vegans, but omnis won't know the difference.

I've visited this location a handful of times, and each experience has been nothing but pleasant. I have tried the fried mushrooms, the sesame soy protein, the orange soy protein, the sweet & sour soy protein, the wheat gluten veggie mix, the general tso soy protein and the hot and sour soup. 

My favorite is the sesame soy protein, but I plan to try all of the soy protein dishes at some point. The wheat gluten is tasty, but it's not the best I've ever had. I prefer the meaty and solid texture of the soy protein over tofu and wheat gluten. 

The spicy dishes are never spicy. You can always ask for extra chile paste like I do though. It's weird that they aren't spicy enough, but that could be because this area isn't as likely to have a preference for the spicy foods. 

My last visit here on April 1st was definitely the most memorable. The sweetest young male was our server. He forgot sesame on our sesame soy protein, and he apologized profusely and fixed it. He kept bringing us refills, especially on my diet coke. Restaurants can be a little stingy with soda refills, but he was generous. He also gave us free rice refills, and since we all love rice, we were immensely grateful. I can't say enough good things about this kid, but I hope the tip we left him conveyed our gratitude.

China Palace is a win for sure!"
"PA","As I was thinking about writing this review I am debating ordering China Palace take-out. Obviously I'm a fan. They are quick with take out and prices are fair and food is great. I've never had a bad meal. I love the sushi selection."
"PA","Very Good!

Got the Beef Stew in Hot Pot. Pretty Spicy, but so delicious. 
Happy to have found this place on our stopover in Shadyside."
"PA","Went here for lunch a couple of times and it seems to be a pretty average Chinese place.  Most of the options are typical Americanized sorts of things with few more traditional or authentic Chinese options.  The sauces for me seem overly sweet and syrupy, especially for the General Tso's chicken.  I would like to see more spice and complex flavors and less sauciness.  They do have a large assortment of vegetarian options and vegetarian version of typical dishes with soy or wheat gluten.  I do really like their scallion pancake appetizer.  Service was good and food came out quickly.  Hot tea is included."
"PA","In sum, we ordered take out here a few days ago. There were bugs in my egg drop soup. Nuff said.


Usually, I write these long reviews. Not today. I ordered two orders of soup Hot and Sour and Egg Drop. I only eat the Hot and Sour the night we ordered our take out. I specifically ordered the Egg Drop to have for lunch yesterday. Fortunately for me- I noticed the bugs prior to eating. Looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup. Disgusting."
"PA","The worst chinese food I've had. I got the General Tso's Chicken and it came dry and very not spicy at all when I asked for extra spicy. Panda Express is better."
"PA","Good food.  They use good ingredients and present dishes well.  If they weren't in Shadyside, which peaked 40 years ago, they'd get the acclaim they deserve."
"PA","What has happened to this place? Used to be delicious, but something's changed! Rude host...pointed us to a table (of course the personal cell phone BS going on with a friend was far more important) for a noon lunch, in a nearly empty restaurant. Nor good signs and we should have walked out then. We started with a bland egg roll. Moved on to fair won ton soup. Entrees of cashew chicken and Kung Pao chicken, both on brown rice we're disappointing. Left us both wishing that we had gone for Thai food down the street instead! Save yourself and opt for one of the other fabulous dining experiences in Shadyside!"
"PA","Was there at a busy time -- Mother's Day dinner -- and the service was poor, with a waitress who did not ask specifics and was slow to deliver things like hot mustard and kept us waiting for our order for over an hour.  Not all her fault.  And, the food was ordinary.  Not bad, a little tasteless, but why bother?"
"PA","This place can pass as average if you order the right thing.  I have taken out from here about a dozen times in the past year mainly because it is so convenient to my place but after trying their sweet and sour chicken this last time I will probably stay away for now (soggy/slimy, not very appetizing or tasty).  Entrees like chicken with any kind of veggies/mushrooms are okay.  Price is not bad.  Why is it so hard to find a good chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh?"
"PA","My husband and 2 yr old daughter went there for a lunch. We arrived at noon and the place was complete empty, but we witnessed a transformation as it got full by the time we left. The staff was helpful and prompt to bring a straw for my daughter to have her water. We shared a palace duck, which consists n boneless strips of duck with stir fried veggies (broccoli, baby corn, bamboo, the usual) covered with sauce. It was not memorable but definitely heartwarming and a good choice for a quick Sunday family lunch. We also had fried pork dumplings for appetizer and egg drop soup, which were average.

The general Tso chicken we spotted on another table seemed to be a popular choice and looked tasty; next time we will try that one for sure."
"PA","I will say this is as good as it gets for vegetarian Chinese food! Plus they deliver to my apartment.

I got the Kong Pao Wheat Gluten & Veggie Lo mein. It wasn't excessively spicy, but enough to make it flavorful. I ordered this for myself....I had a HUGE plate of both with some white rice & a spring roll. I literally still have enough for 2 more meals. With a total of $22.50, it was the best quick & tasty Sunday dinner for a non-meat eater!"
"PA","This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. Great location, great veggie options. Every meal I have eaten there has been tasty.  Only 2 things that bother me, the hot and sour soup is TOO hot. I can't eat it. And it's not easy to find a parking space. Lots of driving around to find a spot. 
But the restaurant is definitely worth checking out."
"PA","I live a couple minutes walk from this place so I find myself coming here for lunch or dinner often when I'm in the mood for Chinese food.  

The servers are nice and good service is always important to me.  

I haven't tried many of their dishes as I always tend to order the same dishes but its a good place for Chinese food in shadyside.  The lunch specials are a great deal and I do like the interior of the restaurant.  

It's pretty much straight forward American Chinese food, not amazingly authentic or true to actual Chinese cuisine, but good enough for our western taste buds."
"PA","After searching around Pittsburgh for the kind of Chinese food that can fill the void for Golden Chopsticks in Wheeling, I finally had a stroke of luck and found this place based on another Yelper's review. 

As a vegetarian, having so many options in one restaurant can be quite novel. Their menu is extensive, for both meat and vegetarian dishes. Oh, and the soups! There's veggie wonton, egg drop, corn soup, and vegetarian hot and sour! JOY! The entrees list is far too long to get into, but I'll say that proteins include tofu and soy protein ""meat"". My personal favorite and go-to entree is kung pao soy (it is really good with extra spice if you like that sort of thing) and veggie wonton and egg drop soups are my favorite. A nice pot of tea accompanies your visit and the entree potions are large enough to share if you are in the sharing mood. They also have a large lunch menu that includes a big portion of the dish you order and a soup.

The atmosphere at China Palace is pretty relaxed and calming, with minty green walls and dark cherry-stained chairs. The dining room is spacious and can easily accommodate groups of 10-12. 

Vegetarians, if you are feeling unsure about what is in your dish, look for the manager (owner maybe?) who seems to be a constant fixture there and who has a complete knowledge of the menu items. He'll gladly quell your fears and help you out with trustworthy information."
"PA","General tso's chicken... was bad... just bad... too soy saucy... it needs more tanginess... It didn't taste the way that it should be... 

I am never going to order their General tso ever again. Never ever whatsoever!"
"PA","I only go to two Chinese restaurants in Pgh and this is one of them. They offer an impressive Vegetarian Menu with soy protein, wheat gluten, and tofu. They have a nice lunch special too that features several dishes from their regular veg menu, including vegetarian hot and sour soup.

The atmosphere is nice and the place looks much nicer inside than you would expect from the outside. The waitstaff is both nice and attentive and because I eat here a lot, they remember me. 

My boyfriend is neither vegan nor vegetarian but almost always orders soy protein, his favorite is the Orange Soy Protein. 

I recommend the Kung Pao Soy Protein for lunch and Shredded Heaven for dinner. Seriously, you need to try the Shredded Heaven. It's comprised of wheat gluten (seitan), tofu, bamboo shoots, and an assortment of other awesome things."
"PA","Okay, I'll toss this place one extra star.  I guess I shouldn't let one bad (repeatedly bad, though,) server kill the whole place's reputation.

The reason I gave in?

They use legit-style Tofu! Oh mercy me, I'm gettin' the vapors just thinkin' about it!

I have to give them credit for that.  Also, the reasonably-priced lunch special really saved the day on a hungover Saturday morning.

BUT let us not think the entire picture has changed.  I'd like to dock them half a star if I could, because they charged me $2 for an egg roll! Insaaaaaane! It wasn't even that good."
"PA","I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic, from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville, I have enjoyed it.  In light of that, China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of okay.

The positives: 

The vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different.  The food isn't terrible, either, but it's not great.  It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there, I tried to go to Pamela's first, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh, and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.

The negatives:

Dim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It's not romantic, just dim.

The only waitress I've had there is pretty rude.  She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60, because she didn't do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.

The food is only okay.  

All in all, if you're on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace, try something else.  You won't HATE your experience here, but it won't be memorable, either.  I will probably return, though, for the cheap lunch specials, but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can, not because I really love the place."
"PA","Mmmmmm, great Chinese food here!   My dad and I came here for dinner last night after finding out that Jimmy Tsangs had closed.  Rick had to teach a night class and Mom had a meeting to go to.  Besides, I hadn't been here since my last review.  Yeah, I know the chow here is Americanized Chinese food.  Who cares--it's great stuff!  

Now when eating Chinese, you should never begin by diving in to your main course right away.  First you've gotta have some soup and some egg rolls!  Dad and I both began with some r-e-a-l-l-y good hot-n-sour soup.  Man, that was good-n-bold.  Warmed my insides right away!  Now I know that vegetable spring rolls are supposedly better for you.  Yeah right--what's a great Chinese dinner without some good old fashioned egg rolls?  I like to put a spoonful each of sweet-n-sour sauce, duck sauce, and hot Chinese mustard on my plate, dipping my egg roll in a different one with each bite!  

I love the names of some of their specialties here, including the Triple Crown, Three Afire, Sizzling Trio, and the Royal Match.  Feeling a little adventurous--and why not:  the old man was paying--I went for the Jaded Affair.  Yum, scallops and shrimp marinated in white sauce.  Usually seafood isn't my first choice.  My dad went for the Kung Pao Chicken.  I've got to give him credit--how a guy his age can eat that and not reach for the Mylanta is beyond me!"
"PA","I've passed by this place on Walnut Street many times without so much as a glance.  But when I returned to Pittsburgh after a trip to DC, I was tired and hungry.  I remembered I had an All Menus coupon for takeout, and China Palace was one of the participating restaurants.

This is the friendliest Chinese eatery for a Pittsburgh vegetarian/vegan.  There are tons of dishes with wheat gluten and soy protein in addition to the more standard tofu.  They even offer veggie shrimp on the menu.

I ordered a spinach and seaweed salad, and the Sizzling Sensation, which is wheat gluten and stir-fried vegetables in a very peppery sauce.  The salad was pretty much what you'd expect, and the Sizzling Sensation definitely perked up my taste buds.  I usually love black pepper, but this was a little much for me.  The vegetarian dishes aren't cheap, running around $12-15 for an entree, though the minimum order for delivery is $12.  The portion size provides at least 2, if not 3, servings.

I should also note that I placed this order on Super Bowl Sunday and wouldn't have been surprised if it arrived later than my requested delivery time--but it even arrived a few minutes early."
"PA","Best Chinese restaurant before Chuan Ba Wang on forbes ave. was open. I don't know why American people like to eat American Chinese food. If u like Chinese food, u should go to the restaurant which provide real food not just cheese or something. U will never find cheese in the real Chinese food. So if u like cheese please go to wendy's to order a burger."
"PA","The portions are huge. Reasonable price. The fish I ordered was decent."
"PA","I liked it.  Huge portions, not too expensive, and it's really nice inside.  I like my cheesy general tsos, what can I say.  It's not cuisine, but if you want a big fat plate of sweet and sour pork in a relaxed ambience it's great.

I'm psyched that they deliver."
"PA","We used to visit this place most every time we went to Pittsburgh.   The menu has change and so has the food  I ordered off the lunch lunch special and the Kung Pao Chicken was average at best and the egg roll was horrible.  My friends has water chestnuts with black spots in their dishes.  We shall not be going back there."
"PA","Moving from the Midwest, I was pumped when I found this place at their former location in Squirrel Hill and discovered their vast vegetarian menu. General Tso's soy protein is a winner, although a bit sweet. They retained their veg menu at their Shadyside site and it's the same. Lunch is the way to go here--very expensive otherwise. Beware of soup--kind of got congealed in transit. 

Overall, this place holds a special place in my heart as it's very veg-friendly. However there are better Chinese places in PGH."
"PA","This place was ""OK,"" but I probably wouldn't go back. Food was kind of low end Chinese although service and atmosphere were fine. Not really bad, just not good either."
"PA","People who reviewed this place as being GOOD... obviously retain the taste buds of a snake (fyi: snakes have no taste buds).

Came here with my parents while we were scoping out apartments for me to live in. Wanted to go to Pamela's, but the line was too long so we walked a few doors down to China Palace. I was REALLY wary because I did a quick Yelp search before we walked in, but my dad insisted that it was probably ""not that bad"".

Here's what we ordered:
- Cheese wontons (Um... they literally just fried american cheese in the wontons. Who does that?! It's supposed to be CREAM CHEESE!! And they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in.)
- Chicken Lo Mein
- Beef Lo Mein
- Shrimp and Broccoli w/ Sweet and Sour Soup (The soup was the most disgusting texture of I-don't-know-what. Needless to say, that was left untouched.)

Let's just say, not only did it take 30-40 minutes to get our food (for food that was of LESSER quality than Chinese takeout), the food itself was just utterly disappointing... A complete travesty to Chinese cuisine. It was bland, yet greasy and MSG-ridden (if that makes any sense). Not only that, they also didn't have BEEF CHOW FUN (ok, so whoever claims this restaurant serves ""authentic"" Chinese food clearly has no clue on what they're talking about). And the kicker? It came out to about $32 + tip for food that we DIDN'T even finish half of. We literally just got up mid-meal when we overheard the table behind us complaining about how they found a dead fruit fly in their bowl of rice.

DO NOT GO HERE!!! ... unless you're a snake that is."
"PA","If you like authentic Chinese food like me, you will love this place. 

I am actually surprised to see all these negative reasons here.
I guess the trick here is that they have both authentic food and Americanized food. I never tried the Americanized dishes but the Chinese ones are decent. I always just order their specials, which are listed on the first page of their menu.

My favorite dishes are: 
Chinese style mapo tofu, 
Beijing duck (you need to order it ahead), 
fish with the spicy sauce (The spicy flavor does not just come from the spicy dry red peppers but also sichuan peppers. It has a special tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug.),  
and the pork stir fry with bamboo shoots."
"PA","Its americanized, but pretty tasty! I love the fried rice and usually just get that. We were getting takeout once and waited at the bar, and the bartender gave us free tastes of the lychee cocktail while we waited! And that was tasty too!

Its also never crowded, its quiet and the service is consistently not bad. 

All that being said though, there isn't really anything special about this place. Its just kind of...eh... Best as take out."
"PA","My husband and I ate lunch here--actually, it was our first meal in our new home of Pittsburgh.

I really expected it to be better than it was.  It was cheap, fast, and the service was good but the food just didn't wow me.  There was nothing WRONG with it, but it was just middle-of-the-road americanized Chinese lunch special.  (Which I suppose I can't complain about, since I knew that when I ordered it.)

That being said, this Chinese place has an amazing vegetarian selection!  I'm not just saying that because I moved from Omaha, beef capital of the universe.  I ordered General Tso's tofu for lunch--and I could have ordered General Tso's soy protein!  Ha!

I would come back here, maybe, if I was looking for a quick bite in Shadyside.  But for now I think I'll stick to trying other Chinese places in the 'Burgh."
"PA","I think I actually want to give China Palace four stars, but I am not sure yet... 

I avoided this place for awhile because of its generic sounding name. Once I saw the extensive menu, with vast vegetarian selections, I realized that there is hope for a vegetarian in need of a quick fix. And I have found the food to be well above average American-Chinese takeout . 

I really like the chewy consistency of their soy protein. I am a fan of chewy...I know it's not for everybody. 

They do have brown rice! At least, they do now, and it's mighty good. A little chewy, too. 

Last night, I tried the ""Sizzling Sensation"" wheat gluten (mock beef). The sauce was not as spicy or peppery as I would have liked, but it was flavorful and the texture of the gluten was pleasantly soft and chewy (not as hard as the soy protein, though my dining companion who is not a fan of the chewy likened it to gristle). I also had the broccoli with garlic sauce, which is the dish I usually count on in Chinese fare, and it was a delicious compliment to the other dish. Unlike the broccoli and garlic sauce of most places, the broccoli was not swimming in goop and it actually tasted garlicky and even tangy. The broccoli was crisp and fresh. The meal was entirely satisfying and I will order both of these dishes again. 

Speaking of dishes, one entree that I can warn against is the ""Taro Bowl A-La-King."" Looks and tastes as if cooked in dish water... 

If you do not like greasy food, order from the selection of steamed dishes, or ""weight watchers"" items. That goes for just about anywhere! 

Delivery from China Palace has been quick in my experience, almost unbelievably so! In-house service is also quick and notably friendly."
"PA","For a quick, decent Chinese place in Shadyside, check out China Palace.  You get what you expect, it's fast and not too expensive.  I've only had delivery, but when I want Chinese food I've never had any surprises.

At the end of the day, you get what you pay for.  As for delivery in they area, it's decent enough."
"PA","Ordered Peking duck for delivery at 5:30 yesterday.  I was told it would take 45 minutes, but the food did not arrive until after 7:00.  I had to throw it in the microwave because it was no longer hot.  The duck itself was not that great; the skin (usually the best part of the duck) was soggy instead of crispy and the meat lacked flavor.  If anyone knows a place in Pittsburgh that serves good Peking duck, please message me."
"PA","The food here was greasy, uninspired and bland. The mockmeat ""chicken"" was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy. It was something I grew tired of in a matter of five or six bites.

I was also disappointed that they don't serve brown rice.

The service was friendly enough, though. 

Not to be recommended unless you're desperate."
"PA","China Palace offers both Americanized Chinese Food and more authentic style dishes.  A good portion of their menu is populated by items such as General Tso's Chicken and Moo Shu Chicken, but there are also more authentic dishes such as Szechuan Water Boiled Beef (shui zhu nio) and Yu xiang Eggplant.  Personally I have to say the Water Boiled Beef is both the best Water Boiled Beef I've had in Pittsburgh and also the best dish I've had at China Palace, I like all my spicy dishes with extra spicy.  Their Americanized offerings are also cooked pretty well, definitely better than take out restaurants.

Contrary to popular belief, China Palace actually has a Taiwanese owner and not an American owner.

China Palace is nice as you can go there with people with more Americanized palates if you have a more Asian palate, or vice versa, and you can please everyone.

Prices run from around 9 dollars to upper teens for some of the chef's specials.

Highly Recommended."
"PA","This was my first Chinese food experience here in Pitt, and I've gotta say, guys, I wasn't impressed.  This was also the first time in my life I've ordered from a Chinese restaurant where the lady taking the orders and the delivery guy were white.  Odd.  I suppose, then, I shouldn't have been surprised by the food.  My Moo Shu Chicken was mostly cabbage.  The pork dumplings were all dough, and the dough was very thick and unappealing.  To end on a good note, though, the hot and sour soup was both hot and sour, which you don't always find."
"PA","Yumm-eeee!  I don't care if the previous reviewer thinks that this place is Americanized Chinese food--I love it!    As I've said on other reviews, I like my food kind of plain, so I love the Sesame Chicken or the Chicken Broccoli.  I figure that if a place can get the basics right, then they can do the more complicated dishes.  My husband Rick likes his food a little spicier.  His favorite is the Kung Pao Shrimp.  Once when I was feeling bold, Rick and I split an order of Crispy Whole Fish with Homemade Spicy Hunan Sauce.  Spicy?  I think I saw through time after trying it!

One dish I'm going to try someday is Three's Company.  No, it does not feature Joyce DeWitt, John Ritter, or Suzanne Summers.  It is  Lemon Chicken, General Tso's Chicken and Chicken with Vegetables.  For the vegetarian-inclined, they have Soy Protein with Cashew Nuts, Soy Protein with Curry Sauce, and Wheat Gluten with Garlic Sauce.  Uh, no thanks!  I'll stick to my chicken dishes!  

China Palace features a full bar, but since I'm a diabetic, I usually stick to my tea.  Plus my drink of choice (Bailey's with Coffee) probably would not go well with Chinese food!  On the whole, China Palace is a place for wonderful Chinese food and definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.

Now should I try one of their other specialties, Three Afire?"
"PA","Even as a vegetarian, I felt REALLY silly ordering ""orange wheat gluten"" or ""sesame soy protein"". But their vegetarian menu is fantastic! I'm happy ordering veggies and tofu and Asian restaurants. But I really miss sesame chicken, and I can get it at China Palace! 

The food itself is every so slightly above par. It's a little sweet, but not too oily. I can't vouch for their meat dishes, as the person I went with is also veg. They really manage to create satisfying, typical Chinese dishes, with meat substitutes that would fool most meat eaters.

It's definately expensive, we paid $40 for three entrees and a salad. And there's other Chinese food that's just as good for less money. But for vegetarians who miss ""typical"" dishes, China Place is so the place to go!"
"PA","Wow! I can't believe I found this store in Pittsburgh! Amazing  clothing brands like Alaia, GIVENCHY, Lanvin, The Row...their designer list is endless! I can not believe the shoes and the jewelery was amazing...Irene Neuwirth, Monique Pean, Jennifer Meyer etc... Who would of thought in Pittsburgh? I will definitely be back on my next visit!!"
"PA","So I wrote a review but it was filtered. I think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside. I have no ties to this place; I don't know any of the other owners of shops in Shadyside and I am 100% un-bias and wrote my review purely on my experience there. Why was it filtered?"
"PA","This store is shameful to the Shadyside family. Upon entering the shop, the blond sales associate judged my friend and I by staring at us and abruptly walking away without a greeting. My friend was given dirty looks form the elderly sales associate while I tried to ignore the rudeness and enjoy the clothing. I am not complaining about the prices, I have bought many items from the same designers and enjoy the designers quality, I was not sticker shocked. What I am upset about is the customer service by these women who think it is okay to treat potential customers with such disrespect. Neither me friend nor I were dressed poorly, we are both fashion stylist in the Pittsburgh area. I have never been so disrespected in my life and after writing this review I will be contacting the owner."
"PA","Not really for females under 45."
"PA","My Pittsburgh friend says that this is her fave store.  Well, as far as high fashion goes, this is it for Pittsburgh.  Tiny selection of some higher end designers, Dolce and Gabbana, Lanvin, Tory Burch....a small selection of shoes (even some Prada).  A selection of nice jewelry and a good selection of knits.  They had one of my fave knitwear company's, Inhabit .  A bigger selection than I had seen anywhere.  I bought a few of those, so I guess it is my fave store in Pittsburgh, too."
"PA","I always drop in on their semi annual sales, this one is a particularly small store and they don't carry the victoria's secret Pink line which is both good and bad.  You don't get bombarded with neon colors sequins and such in this store and i can see that someone past their twenties would appreciate that unless they are shopping with their daughter.  You know what you get at vs, this is a more intimate store with not as much selection."
"PA","Oh OooH OOoooOOOoH. Bras and panties galore. I think this has to be every womans candy store. 

I will say for this specific location I'm not a big fan of the whole ""whose gonna pounce on the new person in the store first"" sales attitude. Let me peruse for my underpants in private first. If I have questions I'll ask. I tend to think these ladies forget that I'm looking for my intimates not buying a new car.

Selection is limited due to the fact its been squeezed in on Walnut Street but there's always the Waterfront location if you want to go bat shit looney."
"PA","I've been going to Eddy for years. In fact I am his first paying client. I have followed him from different salons and was so happy when he landed at Salon Cercone. I believe he's been there 8 years or so now. It's a perfect fit for him as a stylist and me as a client.
Eddy is a true artist in his craft. I have had every colour, cut and style and then some. Anything Eddy or I could think up over the years, I've worn it. Over twenty years later and I still get compliments from complete strangers on my look. I owe it all to Eddy!
The atmosphere is upscale but not stuffy. The staff are a knowledgeable group of extremely talented hair, skin and nail artists. There are many salons to choose from but not many that offer excellence. Salon Cercone is a true Shadyside gem."
"PA","Best Salon in Pittsburgh! I've been going to Eddy for a few years now and he never fails to make my hair look a thousand times better than it does when walking in the door. I have super thick, curly hair and he makes cutting and styling it look effortless. Super talented stylist who is always great fun to talk to! 

Everyone at Salon Cercone are really nice, and the environment is welcoming and casual. It's definitely a great place for the more laid back salon goers."
"PA","The reviews don't lie.  Eddy nailed it!  I have short curly hair and I am extremely picky about how I have it cut.  He got it right.  Better than right, it''s perfect.  He talks a blue streak, but it was always entertaining.  If you have truly curly hair and you live in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, go to Eddy."
"PA","Eddy was recommended to me by a friend since I have curly hair. Pretty much my entire life I'd never done anything with my hair except trim it (cut-wise, I dyed it for a long time), but I decided it was time for a change. I decided to go with a dramatic look and I was very nervous (not sure how well I hid it) but Eddy was super nice and I calmed down quickly after we started chatting. And WOW, he did an absolutely fantastic job! He cut it perfectly to enhance my curls and did everything exactly as I asked (I've had trouble before with stylists ignoring my instructions about cutting my bangs or being too timid about cutting off damage). This is, without a doubt, the best haircut I've ever had. (Though that may change since I'm planning to go back to him later to try more styles!) I wanted a cut that was both feminine and fierce and he nailed it.  

I highly recommend Eddy for anyone with curly hair! I also greatly appreciated the student discount."
"PA","I am always super weary about going to a new place to get my haircut, as I have had many a bad experience. I have wavy/loosely curly hair that I like to keep cut short, and that combination seems to be lethal for many stylists.

I found a recommendation for Eddy on the internet as a curly hair specialist, and I started going a year ago and am so glad I did! He has never given me a bad cut, and even gave me an awesome 'more experimental' style that I had been waiting to try. I'm moving away from Pittsburgh and I wish I could take Eddy with me!

(In addition, I recommended him to one of my friends, who has super thick hair with some body, and he also gave her an awesome haircut!)"
"PA","Gary is great with coloring (blonde). It's a cool, laid back little salon."
"PA","I have mixed feelings about Salon Cercone. On one hand, Eddy does wonderful work with curly and wavy hair - the main reason I switched stylists and found him. On the other hand, after being a client for over a year, he suddenly didn't show up for an appointment. I waited for 20 minutes then finally had to leave as my lunch break was ending. The receptionist didn't apologize at the time but kept saying, ""I don't know why he's late"" though I saw him talk to Eddy on the phone. No one ever apologized or gave a legitimate reason (things happen!). I'm a reasonable person, but I haven't gone back. This breaks my heart because he's such a wonderful guy who does great work, but if I can't rely on a stylist to show up, that's a deal breaker.

Also, when I was bleached platinum, I was going in to see Joel for root touch-ups. I told him the first time around that I used toner to create a white-blonde look, yet he didn't use a toner on me saying I didn't need one. After a couple of months, I noticed that the areas he bleached were definitely more brassy than the rest of my hair and no matter what I did, I couldn't tone down the brassiness...so I had to go darker all over. Later, he saw me in the salon with darker hair and asked why. When I explained the situation, he claimed that I'd never mentioned toner. Oy."
"PA","I've been going to Salon Cercone for a few years now. 
I am super picky about hairdressers, and tried a bunch out before I found Michael. He's awesome. He LISTENS! : ) I'm sure I'm an annoying customer, but he's patient, and I always leave happy. 
+ I always get zillions of compliments on my hair : ). 

The Salon is cute, friendly and very well priced! Also, its easier to find parking nearby."
"PA","ladies with curls, this is a very cute little place with decent prices and service. eddie is the sweetest stylist AND he knows how to cut curls (he has them). it's tiny and fairly no-frills, but clean and attractive. also right by great bagels, so that's another plus. ;)"
"PA","2 woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable. I haven't received my piece yet and its been about 5 days. Iffy about who owns the place but, ill see what the end product will be once I was receive it. If it approves I will change my rating"
"PA","Very nice inventory, as others have said. The company has been, however, very slow in resizing jewelry items purchased at the store, and failed to meet promised deadlines in performing resizing."
"PA","The owner stole a bracelet brought in for repairs and has lied over and over about returning it."
"PA","Holy beautiful beads!  What an amazing and unique store to stumble upon!

If you're into making your own jewelry, this is thee store for you.  There's just rows and rows of beautiful beads from different parts of the world.  Really, anything and everything you can think of from pearls, to amethyst to crystals and many many more is right in front of you to purchase.  Of course, this type of hobby will probably set you back a pretty penny...but I'm sure if you're investing in these pieces you're going to be making some gorgeous jewelry!

If you are not into making your own jewelry but love unique and one of a kind pieces, this store is ALSO the store for you!  They have amazing handcrafted necklaces, bracelets and earrings.  But what really caught my eye was the incredible rings.  Maybe because they were actually in my kinda sorta price range, but again, they were just so unique.  Stone rings, glass rings, crystal rings.

If you're heading to Shadyside, you have to stop in to be hypnotized by the jewels!"
"PA","This restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance. That is where the positive ends. The food is LOUSY. I paid $9 for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen (OK, it was thawed, but had previously been frozen) corn, about 4 tablespoons of black beans and the same amount of feta. As a vegetarian, this salad was one of two that had some sort of substance to make one think of a meal. What a disappointment - I won't be back."
"PA","Had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years.  We shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps.  Both were delicious, and I'm freaking thrilled when a restaurant knows what a caramelized onion is supposed to look like!  My flatbread was smothered in them, just the way I like it.  The sashimi was nothing crazy, I liked the grilled pineapple with it.  

My husband got himself a burger, the barbecue one, to be exact, and I had the wild mushroom pasta.  I was concerned it would be too similar to the flatbread, but the server raved about it, so I tried it anyway.  

My husband enjoyed his burger, though he thought it could have been less salted.  He was happy that the temperature was correct, also.

 The salad that came with my entree was... Ok.  The blue cheese dressing was eh, the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda squishy, and I actually spit out a crouton.  It had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil.  I usually love croutons too.

The pasta was tasty, but almost too tasty, if that makes sense.  Too many competing flavors.  My husband was thrilled that they got ""al dente"" right, when he had a bite.  I'd also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch, but there aren't a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat.

Overall, I'd eat here again, and get the same apps and a lighter entree."
"PA","Not too shabby.  I would call it a ""finer diner"" in terms of the definition of a Diner.  The menu has your everyday American items; nothing too creative or imaginative.   It's pretty basic.  Salads, sandwiches, burgers and entrees we have all had before.
The food is good though; however you're paying for the location and decor (which, in our opinion, was kind of out-dated).  We started with the mushroom flatbread that was a bit on the sweet side; however it was loaded with mushrooms which is a huge plus.
I had the walnut crusted salmon sandwich and Jordan had the reuben.  The salmon was very light and tasty and Jordan's corned beef was sliced real thick.  French fries are pretty standard.
All in all, I guess this is where the rich people of ShadySide get their diner food: same kind of food, just a fancier ambiance than Denny's.  
We will be back when we want something comforting but dont want to be surrounded by teenagers and want something better than Eat 'N Park."
"PA","A staple of the Walnut Street experience, Walnut Grill has been around forever. The menu changes regularly, which is great because you can always try something new, but is difficult if you are really digging a specific dish. They always have great sandwiches and soups, and the salads are always good. Their balsamic vinaigrette is sweet and delish. 

Went with Rachel C. recently and had one of the regular menu items and one of my fav apps they have ever had-spinach artichoke dip! Large chunks of artichoke and a strong garlic flavor makes this the best spinach artichoke dip in town! A must have when you visit. 

Nice atmosphere, good service at my last visit. Stop hating on Walnut Grill!"
"PA","I'm seriously confused at why people hate on this place so much.  Maybe the service/food can be iffy at times, but today it was great!  I hadn't been here in a really long time, so I felt like I had to try the food again to write a proper review.  

We got the ""best seat in the house"" according to the host.  That actually means the seat by the window so you can people watch.  Everything looks good on the menu, so I opted for a little bit of everything.  I started with the cauliflower soup.  I didn't know what to expect, but it came as pureed with a cheesy taste to it.  It was amazing!  I asked the server what was in it and she said it was cream cheese.  Mystery solved, cream cheese makes everything better!  

I also tried the beat salad.  I loved the fact that there was golden and red beets in it.  I just wish there were more, although I always feel that way about beet salads at restaurants it seems.  The main course was the Walnut Crusted Salmon with Bread Pudding and Apple Buerre Blanc.  It was really tasty.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, which meant not over cooked at all, and the bread pudding/apple buerre was really delish!  

Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive and I really couldn't ask for a better meal.  I've been won over and I'd definitely go back...and try ten things again:)"
"PA","My only experience with this place was for brunch on a Sunday morning. However....

It was quite fantastic! I was sitting with three other people, and all of our food was delicious! (Not to mention reasonably priced)

Our server was delightful and very efficient as well.

I have read some negative reviews here and kept them in mind before eating there. Must say I didn't agree with them on this particular meal."
"PA","Came here with a whole bunch of girls on a Wednesday night due to their half-priced wine situation.  Actually, we meant to go to Shady Grove but it was PACKED, so upstairs we trekked to Walnut Grill.

It's dim up there, and has a more formal vibe than shady grove.  The half-priced wine was pretty good, we tried several of the bottles and they were all perfectly decent.  I loved their spinach and artichoke dip, scraping the bottom of the ramekin as best I could to get all the tasty bits.  Our server, who was very friendly and cheerful despite having to deal with such a huge group, recommended the California Pretzel Club.  I have to say, it was pretty good.  Dense, and filling, but I enjoyed it.  The avocado spread was a nice touch.  I couldn't finish it, though I made a good effort on the fries, but my boyfriend polished it off later. 

As the evening progressed, they turned the music up - WAY up - I'd say by 9 pm we had to shout to hear each other.  That wasn't very cool - it's Wednesday and you're serving dinner.  People are here to have conversation, it's not a dance club.  Sorry, but I'm old and crochety (at age 26) and I like to hear what my dinner companions are saying.

The entrees looked pricey, but apps and sandwiches are reasonable.  I'd come back for more half-priced wine and a snack sometime."
"PA","Great location, ambiance, and service. Unfortunately food is the weak link.

Went for Sunday brunch yesterday and ordered the chicken and waffles. Took quite a while to get it to the table.  Waffle batter very plain and not of the Belgian variety that I prefer with sugar granules. If not for the little bit of syrup, it would be incredibly bland. Trader Joes pumpkin and off the shelf Krusteaz waffle batter much better than this. Fried chicken was not bad, but I couldn't but think that it was in the fryer just a tad bit long...

Street parking can be challenging at times."
"PA","When I visited walnut grill in shadyside, the service was very good, however the only problem I had was when I ordered a ribeye steak sandwich and the server informed me that this can only be cooked one way. The sandwich was good, I just don't understand how u can only cook a steak one way. Decent beer selection, but would probably not go back."
"PA","This place has cockroaches.
People throw up in the booths.
Pretty good white russian.

(b)"
"PA","Good if not great place to get a meal at.  Mom and I were having a girls day out and we decided to stop in here for brunch before heading over to the Phipps. 

The chicken 'n waffles (organic fried chicken in gravy plus waffles) caught my eye as did the eggs benedict.  But I was in the mood for some sweetness.  The  cinnamon swirl French Toast with sausage links was pretty good.  Mmmm, French Toast!  Pump that insulin, Susan.  Pump!  Whoo-hoo!  The cinnamon did give it a nice bite too.  Good thing Rick and I hit the bike trails the day beore.  Mom went for the roasted tomato and bacon frittata, which looked good too.

Many of the negative comments here seem to be about the prices.  The dinner prices look high for what you get, but the brunch prices run about $8.00-$10.00 per entree.  Service here is good though."
"PA","During the three or four times I've been here, I've had friendly service, some decent drinks, and mixed luck with the food. On my last visit, I tried the fish tacos and was sorely disappointed-the tortillas appeared to have been recently revived from the freezer, and the quality of the fish seemed subpar. Still, this is Pittsburgh, so I don't really expect to get decent fish tacos here but like to try occasionally on the off chance that I will succeed. Another failure in my opinion: the fish tacos came with french fries. Who serves fish tacos with french fries?! Maybe if the fries had actually been decent I wouldn't have minded so much, but they were overly salty and soggy.

I've had better luck here with the salads and would recommend those."
"PA","I recently had a party here and it was fabulous.  The service was wonderful from start to finish and the food was wonderful
.  The drinks were great, salads superb, and no matter the choice, everyone loved their meals. We were not rushed at all and the servers, came by religiously to refill water and check to see if anything more was needed. I highly recommend this restaurant whether it be for a drink, a meal or a party."
"PA","Want good bloody mary's to kick off your Saturday or Sunday morning? Come to Walnut Grill. They throw a jumbo shrimp in it which is awesome. The eggs benedict is terrific!"
"PA","my husband and I went there for dinner this evening and while their bunches are usually lovely I don't think we will return for a dinner meal again.

I ordered the steak mid-rare and asked for a Caesar salad for my side... the salad was terrible, bland, the dressing was barely there and i really question if it was actually a caesar dressing. The parmesan cheese tasted old and well, sorta like it had been shaved off the block of cheese ages ago - it was sort of rubbery and bland as well. My steak was more medium than mid-rare and they included a peppercorn sauce which sounded good on the menu but had far too many peppercorns in it and ruined the dish... the mashed potatoes were really good once i picked out the peppercorn overload seeping into it. The broccoli served on the side was barely steamed and seasoned with some surprising and awful seasoning. Completely disappointing.  

My husband's salad looked much more appetizing... baby field greens and ranch dressing - he was happy. He asked for a shrimp alfredo which they did make special for him (they have it as chicken alfredo on the menu). I tasted the sauce and it was ok but very thin and could have used more cheese to add more flavor as well as thicken it. He was happy with the meal but admitted to me that Girasole's alfredo was much much better. 

So no, I don't see us heading back anytime soon for anything other than perhaps a bunch meal. I will say that the service was excellent - the waitstaff was attentive and friendly and they did a great job but the food is overpriced for the quality of preparation."
"PA","Nice setting and service, or the quality of the food it was expensive, 2 children, my wife and I was 50.00 including tip, no wines or alcohol on the tab. Service was really good. Would have been 5 stars but food was average my wife had a charbroiled chicken and it was full of gristle, I had a turkey Rachel which was a turkey sandwich with Cole slaw and Russian dressing on rye, the turkey it self was good the rest was not so good. My oldest daughter wanted spaghetti she got buttered noodles. My youngest got chicken strips, who can screw up chicken strips? The kids fries was the shape of a smile face that was cute."
"PA","While it has a somewhat trendy looking menu, don't be fooled. We ordered the calamari, mexican pizza, ahi tuna, and french onion soup. While the onion soup was actually good, the rest was awful.

The mexican pizza was greasy, and looks like it was reheated in a microwave, it tasted like cardboard, and looked even worse. The calamari was awful, came with a gross looking/tasting dip. The ahi tuna was actually just mediocre, which was a nice improvement from the rest of the meal. 

If i was a bigger jerk I would have demanded they take the food back, but I just had a bite of everything and asked the waitress to take it back.

I would never eat here again"
"PA","My meal, including wine, appetizer, soup, and the walnut salmon entree were all solid and it came in under $40.  The average entree here costs $15.  In D.C., I couldn't get a sandwich, chips and a drink for that during lunch hour.  But by Pittsburgh standards for good food at low prices, this is pretty typical.    

The service was sharp, if a little slow (Saturday night and they were busy, so you have to cut them a little slack).  As a whole, they are really trying, with specials galore, and lots of fancy cocktails which I didn't  try.  

Seriously, this place is not expensive and you get a good quantity of food, they're not stuck up, and my generous $6 pour of wine was smooth but not awesome.  I will probably go back again."
"PA","Just got back from a lunch at the Walnut Grill. I had been there once before about 3 years ago. I don't remember much other than it was a solid meal and the mushroom soup I got was good.

Anyway, it was fairly empty for lunch. Perhaps it's because it has a darker atmosphere (today was gorgeous out) than other SS places. I had the lunch special which was a Cajun chicken sandwich with mozzarella, basil and roasted red peppers (9$). GF got the veggie sandwich which has portabellos, spinach, feta and onions (9$).

My sandwich was great. The chicken was nicely cooked (not dry). The mozzarella was nice and big. The basil was a nice touch and fresh. The roasted red peppers were from a can, but were good. Served on warm ciabatta. Sandwich wasn't overly salty either. The fries were surprisingly good.

GF's veggie sandwich was equally good. I usually don't like spinach, but the bite I had was nice and feta/mushroom-y. She ate all of it (which rarely happens).

I also got a Proper draft which is an English Pale Ale. It was quite good. Nice and malty with minimal hops."
"PA","Too pricey for the quality."
"PA","This place is alright.  I've never gone for dinner - only for lunch as I worked in the neighborhood.  They don't really have any lunch specials per se and the place seemed completely empty.  The service was friendly, the food was just okay.  Nothing really memorable and the prices are a bit high."
"PA","I really enjoyed myself here, but you know what, that was 100% because of the awesome, drunk conversation, all we had was draft beers.  We had 4 for 14$, that doesn't seem too expensive to me.  It was also happy hour when I went there:  half price appetizers (which I didn't eat any of, but were still very exciting).  I have no comments on service, food. or cocktails, and somehow I still really liked it in there!  The bathrooms were CLEAN.  Actually when I went to the bathroom I thought ""these bathrooms are CLEAN!"""
"PA","How to review the Walnut Grill?--a place that served us quality food on a standard menu, but at prices where some imagination would have gone a long way, especially since we paid a lot for it? (Mango salsa, I'm looking at you.) Some of our favorites: the spinach artichoke dip, the pork cheeks, the filet. 

This particular dining experience was also the first time ever a server has ever, with the gravest of grave faces, relayed to us that the kitchen was out of broccoli. Also the first time I giggled at a server. If you're out there: I'm sorry!"
"PA","We had Sunday brunch upstairs and I was very pleased with the quality and quantity of the dishes and the service. Lots better than most."
"PA","Food, blah.  Pierogi with chipotle butter app was terrible- frozen Mrs. T's pierogi in PITTSBURGH is just lazy, and they were drowning in greasy, room temp aforementioned butter which carried heat with absolutely no flavor.  Everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality. Main courses were a cuban sandwich and something I don't recall (bad sign) and were extremely disappointing.

Service, argh.  It was late, but if you're open you're open, right?  Slow, inattentive, wrong sides (which we couldn't correct given the service) an they basically vacuumed around our feet."
"PA","I've had pretty good experiences dining here, but maybe that's because other people were paying for my food about half of those times.  The service was fine, and I liked the decor.  I also enjoyed the food, although if I recall correctly, there was entirely too much of it.

As a carless resident of Pittsburgh, I love the great location on Walnut Street.  I don't have to go out of my way to dine here, since there are plenty of stores to visit."
"PA","I swung by here in the middle of a long day of apartment hunting.  It wasn't very crowded.  There appears to be an adjoining bar area - not sure if it's the same restaurant or not - it's quite small, but contains several comfortable-looking booths and TVs.  Anyways, I was there for lunch.  The service was decent, we were tended to by several friendly employees and the manager came out to see how we were doing, complimenting my father on his choice of Malt Vinegar to accompany his fish and chips.

The food was good, but probably not worth as much as we paid.   For the life of me I can't remember if they had any good beer on tap, I think I drank like forty glasses of water instead.  But I'm sure they've got something acceptable.   I can see myself coming back but probably not as a mid-afternoon pit stop like I did.  It's probably more lively at night ."
"PA","Ok, this place must keep people coming by the ridiculous food portions that they have, because the food itself is not so great.  It's just...  ok.  Nothing special.  Some of it is not good or undercooked, such as a fellow diner's raw swordfish or mahi mahi that seemed more like tilapia.  Wine list just ok and very overpriced.  Dessert - WAY too big of portions (the brownie dessert was enough to feed at least 4-5 people and more, the brownie was undercooked).  There is better food on Walnut, I swear.  And even if there isn't, go somewhere else.  Service is good which brings this back to a 3-star review."
"PA","I didn't find the food all that flavorable, the service isn't great, and it's definitely not worth the price."
"PA","This store is food enthusiast's paradise! They seem to have anything a cook needs: baking equipment, espresso machines, pizza stones, various brands of pots and pans, cookbooks, pantry items, dishware, and more. A food enthusiast myself, I moved to buy one of everything. Alas, my tiny kitchen and my meager budget proved to be the brick wall between me and all the shiny gadgets. (Mental Note: Move to a home with twice the kitchen size--and learn to save money).

Anyways, the employees are very nice and helpful. They seem to know the best uses for each gadget as well as some good tips on how to cook and bake certain foods. They also told me that they hold cooking classes occasionally. While I held off on signing up, others may be interested in trying them out."
"PA","My hubby and I wandered around Shadyside on Saturday afternoon and made Williams-Sonoma one of our stops. It was warm (but not too warm) and sunny (but not too bright), and Williams-Sonoma's doors were thrown open, welcoming customers into a land of expensive kitchen gadgets and extravagant kitchen accessories. The scent of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies wafted from a high-end easy-bake-oven type device set up near the entrance. Needless to say, the store was packed. This really is the perfect Williams-Sonoma location.

My complaint with Williams-Sonoma lies not with this store but with the entire company. The hubby and I have an adequate amount of discretionary income, yet browsing here makes me feel like I live below the poverty line. I just really prefer shopping at Williams-Sonoma's competitors of Crate & Barrel and Sur La Table that have a better balance of low, moderate, and high priced items."
"PA","Great store!

One of the previous reviewers seems to have had some bad experiences with service in the store; my experience thankfully hasn't been the same. I've always had helpful, friendly people working whenever I've popped in to get something for our kitchen.

Great selection of items, and the staff always have great recommendations for me when I'm not quite sure of what I need. Their sales could be a bit better, but that's not necessarily the store's fault, and it's never really worth the longer trip to the South Side to hit their main competitor's store.

Parking can be a bit annoying if you try to get a spot on the street, but the garage around the corner is convenient and is reasonably priced. Gotta love Walnut Street!"
"PA","I live close to the store and go in multiple times a week. The staff is ALWAYS friendly and helpful"
"PA","Generally speaking, I am a huge fan of Williams-Sonoma. In CA, I love their store in Union Square. The service in this store is ridiculous. The ladies seemed to be complaining about something the whole time we were there and seemed to have an attitude as if we were intruding into their space.
The real kicker for me, though, was that they advertise for free gift wrapping but don't seem to really offer it. The first time I came in, my boyfriend spent around $50 on a gift for a friend. We were excited about the gift wrapping but then they said they don't offer gift wrapping after 5 pm. Seriously? Why not? They weren't busy or anything at that moment. Why couldn't they take a couple minutes and wrap our gift for us?
The second time (and the last time) I came in they just said ""no, we don't wrap"". I was so confused and annoyed that I just left after paying. I haven't written a review in over a year but their horrible service motivated me to say something.
Beware of these ladies. They just aren't nice."
"PA","The staff is super friendly every time I'm in this store. I think I've been there almost every month since there's always something there that I'd love to have and it's right down the street.  Whether it's random cooks tools like a 4"" wide vegetable peeler (highly recommended), a Microplane grater or splurging on a new Shun knife, Williams-Sonoma always seems to have what I want with people there who know what they're talking about."
"PA","I really like this william sonoma.  the staff is very helpful and it always smell so yummy when you go by. 

wish i could buy everything in the store!!!"
"PA","Best Chinese food!!! Good delivery service, just love it!"
"PA","Castle Place is your standard take-out-only Chinese restaurant. The location is a little bit run down, and I expected the food to be pretty bad, but my wife and I were sick of Sesame Inn and decided to try something new. Overall the food is hit or miss--some nights are better than others, probably depending on which member of the family that owns the place is cooking--but when it's good it's really very good. Good: We particularly like the General Tso's tofu, which has a great texture. Bad: The pot-stickers are often under-fried."
"PA","BEWARE!! This car wash damaged my 2008 Yukon Denali . Spoke with one of the owners, Justin, and he refused to work with me to get the damaged piece repainted. Do not believe that the ""We Are Responsible"" sign out in front means anything. The brushes are very rough on the vehicle. If you have a dark colored vehicle i would not use this car wash, go to a touchless."
"PA","Always have friendly workers there. Well worth the money to just drive right in and your car comes out spotless every time!!"
"PA","This place is an institution; I'm sure it's been in the same awkward, T-straddling location since the dawn of time, scrubbing the grime off soccer moms' SUVs and dads' sedans. I will say that I was impressed by the newfangled card-reader and frequent-buyer system they've got going on; Grandma was impressed by the novelty of being conveyed through a sea of scrubbing bubbles.

Pro tip: the little glass cleaner wipes they give away? Try leaving a few tucked into your front cupholder as a subtle hint that you live in, or near, Mt. Lebanon. Cheaper than a trip to pick up an OBX sticker for the rear windshield."
"PA","New location in Rostraver! Great wings! Take out wings are usually soggy or
Over cooked...not these! Cajun and buffalo are Amazing!"
"PA","I wasn't crazy about the Untouchable since I don't like Primanti's sandwiches, but the pizza was more than decent. Unfortunately, they don't deliver to us, so we had to go there to get it."
"PA","Remember that saying, that sex is like pizza - even when it's so-so, it's good? That pretty much sums it up. There's nothing appallingly wrong with the Pizza Co. pizza. It's just kind of ho-hum. 

With that said, I enjoyed the chili poppers a lot. (Which were inexplicably wrapped with the ranch sauce for delivery. Mmmmm....hot, sweaty ranch dressing.)

The delivery guy was really friendly. Delivery time was unimpressive. A full 45 minutes mid-afternoon, and I live two blocks away? That's what I get for being lazy, probably. Karmic pizza. 

Prices are pretty good though, so that's a bonus. They may end up being my 'Dangit, I've only got fifteen bucks!' joint. Otherwise, probably not."
"PA","It's pizza, and my family prefers Pizza Company over the big chains, and other local places. We used to order from the Potomac location, since they delivered to our address, but since they've closed, the Library Rd. store is our go to shop. 
The wings, and breadsticks have been given a thumbs up by the kids. Pizza has been consistent, whether we're ordering a cheese pizza, or something with extra toppings like pepperoni, or Italian sausage. Service is friendly, food is good, the only drawback is having to drive Rt. 88."
"PA","This place is the bomb.  Great hoagies.  Great pie.  Fair prices.  Cheap delivery.  I have had a LOT of pgh pizza over the years, and this is a solid non-chain joint.  The sandwiches are fantastic. Probably skip the wings or anything fried, to be honest though.  Cheesebread is fantastic.

It's WELL worth a try folks."
"PA","Old-times feel, but they have awesome hoagies, great pizza, and very good italian food.

They do deliver, and pretty much anything on the menu is able to be ordered for delivery.  The drinks are by the can or by the 2-liter.

In-store, you place the order and they'll either hand it to you at the counter or bring it out to you.  There is very limited seating.

You can call in your order and pick it up, too.

Definitely would recommend."
"PA","I mourned and mourned the loss of Right By Nature. Giant Eagle Market District has been carrying crappier and less-local products for awhile now. The shelves aren't stocked of staples I need (whole wheat tortillas, among other things) and there's not as much organic produce as there was a year or two ago. Sale items are often bare on the shelves, even on weekdays without the weekend crush.

Enter me house-sitting for the future in-laws. 

I'm out here in the South Hills and Shop 'n Save is doing a surprisingly good stand-in job. 

But I've got a hankering. For meat and veggies, two things that are in ample supply but often low in quality. 

You walk in and there's a bevy of random items. Giant watermelons for $5, local pickled vegetables and pickled eggs, tomatoes, onions, you name it. Then you go on and the ""wet"" selection of produce is spot on. Lots of organic produce at fair prices; I picked up cilantro today and lettuce and some potatoes and celery yesterday.

Fresh Breadworks bread - check.

The meat counter is a thing of beauty - their own jerky and cured meats, a handful of prepared items, Boar's Head deli meats. The steaks were gorgeous, the most beautiful I've seen outside of Right By Nature or Strip District Meats. A bone-in filet, or ""cowboy steak"" is on sale for $11/pound. Get there this week for it!

When I stepped up to the counter I tested a young guy; where was the beef from? Did they grind it in-house? The answers were ""all domestic"" and ""yes"". So that meant single-cow, virtually eliminating the risk of salmonella/ecoli issues. Plus grinding it in house? Sold, to the pretty lady rebounding from Right By Nature!

Yesterday was beef, today was chicken. Always pleased with the help I asked for; wrapped well in butcher paper, not crappy saran wrap.

The packaged goods are often local and Amish in origin. Lots of the dairy, such as cheeses and butters, some of them Amish.

Normally I buy Whole Food's organic milk (ranked very well by Cornucopia). I meandered through the milk section, finding glass bottles serving up 1/2 gallons of whole, 2%, 1% and skim from a local dairy. Huh, not bad, pasture raised and local, so no mixing milk from multiple sources or having it travel a lot and losing that freshness. $1.50 for the bottle, which you get back when you return it. 

Excellent service, attention to detail, friendly and knowledgeable meat counter people, local and/or organic produce and ground-in-house beef? I'll be back..."
"PA","I've taken things here a few times over the years. It's in a convenient location, the staff is friendly, and the clothing always looks great. My big issue is that the employees stand directly outside and smoke. This looks awful and smells awful- especially when it blows in the front door choking you while you wait in line. I have no idea how they manage to keep the clothing from reeking (or maybe I've just gotten lucky). I could certainly come here more than I do, but I despise walking through a cloud of smoke every time."
"PA","The good: The ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful. Also, if you live in the area, it's certainly convenient. The alterations are well done. 

The bad: Their alterations manager won't give you an estimate for the work before he does it. Not even a ballpark. So basically, you drop your clothes off, cross your fingers, and hope for the best. Expect the work (even something simple like hemming) to take more than a week, and cost a fair amount. 

In summary: Good work, friendly but slow service, expensive. If it weren't so convenient I doubt I'd go back."
"PA","Nice people, and they never screw up my tailoring. Whenever I ask for an item to be done at a certain time they will get it done. Then I tell them I don't need it that fast and wait at least two weeks before picking it up. I wish the Taco Bell was still close by."
"PA","Extremely rude lady works there on Sundays.  Called at 1:50 p.m.and wanted to pick up a cake for my daughter's birthday.  I was told that they had cakes available but to hurry because they close at 2:00 p.m. sharp.  I arrived at 1:58 p.m. and the rude lady would not let me in.  She kept pointing to the clock.  Pool customer service.  I will NEVER go back."
"PA","If you want to be completely ignored when you walk into a business, then this is the place for you. I walked into this bakery at 4:40PM. There were 2 customers ahead of me and 2 ladies behind the counter. One was waiting on the customers while the other
seemed to be more interested in getting the place ready for closing at 5:00PM and
socializing with someone who walked in after me and was obviously just visiting the lady. The other lady finished with her customer and then walked back to the back of the store and they both completely ignored me for a good 5 minutes while I was waiting by the cake case too buy a cake. Ten minutes later I finally asked them exactly how much longer they were going to ignore me and walked out. I them came back to ask for the owner's name and was told it was Ron. Well Ron, this incident cost you $17.99 which I was going to spend on a Tiramasu cake and also lost you a good customer. I also plan to tell my family and friends NOT to shop here. TERRIBLE SERVICE."
"PA","Graham's is tucked away among a few other stores that I rarely ever visit. The few times I have gone to Graham's the folks have always been very nice and have introduced me to a few different fatty and sugary treats that we all crave now and again. Each product I have had has always been tasty and fresh. I will come back once I work off the extra calories from my most recent visit."
"PA","If you are fearful of going to the dentist, or if you put off going to the dentist for financial reasons, do not go to him! He will lecture you for not going. His bedside manner is terrible. I didn't appreciate the sarcastic comment ""See you in 2020"" as he left the room.  

Will not go back. Instead I will find a dentist who is sensitive to my fear of pain.

UPDATE 12/18/2013:
So I went to another dentist to get my gum fillings filled (which he put in back in 2006 and informed me I needed to have them done again last week). Guess what, I DON'T NEED TO HAVE THEM FILLED! The dentist informed me that Sensodyne should solve the problem. He told me that there isn't a whole near my gum line so the procedure is unnecessary, and if it Sensodyne doesn't help they have a special sealant they can use on me in the future (lasts only 9 months). No drilling! So I basically saved myself over a hundred dollars and two shots of novicane.  I'm so, so angry with myself for letting him convince me to do these ""fillings"" 6 years ago when all I needed was a special toothpaste! 

Not only did they ridicule me for waiting 4 years to get my teeth cleaned, they also ridiculed me for putting off these so-called gum fillings.  To find out that I didn't need to have them done in the first place is infuriating! His lecturing was completely unnecessary! 

I've never seen a medical professional so money hungry before in my life.  Very, very unhappy with his service!"
"PA","I have been going to the Mt. Lebanon location for several years.  I have had veneers put on my upper teeth and later had the lower teeth done.  I can not believe the ease of the procedure (and I am a coward).  The veneers look great and Dr. Medgaus and his staff are wonderful.  I continue to go twice a year for cleanings.  I would highly recommend Dr. Medgaus."
"PA","Went to the monroeville location using a groupon for the free tooth whitening.  The first visit, they said i had cavities that needed filled...ok...so I got them filled the same day....and they weren't filled smoothly!!  I had to come back to get the filling smoothed out because they left a ridge and it was bothering my mouth!! 

they also said i needed MI paste (for $30 from them when online it's ~$15)....ok...so i got that as well not knowing it was something I could get outside of the office

I had to come back in for deep cleaning.  When i got there however and went through the process, the ""deep cleaning"" didn't seem like a deep cleaning at all.  The initial cleaning the first day seemed more thorough and hurt longer. They did all four quadrants in one session, no novicaine (which if you've had a deep cleaning before...it HURTS.....I needed the nitrous oxide the last time I had one.....and it hurt for multiple weeks after as well when I went before).  One of my friends that also has had deep cleanings also said that they're painful and hurt for days afterwards.  This one instead didn't hurt except when i was poked a few times, and i was fine to eat/etc right afterwards.

While getting the deep cleaning the hygenist (because I never saw the dentist except for the fillings when in the past I saw them for deep cleanings as well) said that my mouth was much better and that she thought the pockets (the reason for the deep cleaning) were probably false pockets, that my mouth was much better than the previous month, that I probably didn't need the deep cleaning and that no antibiotic would be needed...maybe if I came in next time I would need them.  So I got a deep cleaning that I may not have needed, didn't feel like a deep cleaning, and set me back $900....in about an hour (they also usually take longer)

Poor experiences multiple times...

oh--and never met Carl."
"PA","China Village has been around for years (at least 28 years that I know of). It's nothing fancy and is a true family business that serves great food. 

You are always waited on by one of the owners and the service is always good. The restaurant isn't too big. Although they can get busy, I don't ever remember having to wait to be seated. 

The wonton soup is absolutely delicious. My personal favorite dish here is the shrimp with lobster sauce. I enjoy it so much I hardly ever get anything else. This is unfortunate because they have a really great menu.

The only thing that bugs me about China Village is that they only accept cash. This has caused me to go someplace else several times. Other than that, I think China Village is a great place to visit."
"PA","Great family run restaurant . I have been going here for 20 years . the food is great and the owner who is the only waitress treats you like family ."
"PA","My favorite family Chinese in Pittsburgh!  Best Won ton soup, egg rolls and fried rice (darkened by soy sauce). Lomein , Moo Gu gi pan yummy!  Service is the best part Kitty with her husband Kwan are the owners and Chief cooks and bottle washers.  They do it all and do it well. Cash only but you don't need much prices are very cheap. Freshly made everything (except the classic fortune cookie in the plastic wrapper and wouldn't have it any other way!). Great Oolong tea with every meal!"
"PA","Definitely a Chinese gem in the South Hills!  Family owned and operated.  It's a husband (chef) and wife (waitress) team that owns/runs the place and my family and I have been coming here for years.  

The food has always been good and fresh.  I always get a bowl of their rice soup and it always hits the spot.  I know that's it's probably a very simple dish to make, but that's definitely my go-to appetizer at this place.  Also the egg roll isn't greasy but always crispy and fresh so I highly recommend.

We usually order the chicken with garlic sauce and a beef dish and haven't been disappointed.  When it gets crowded, service can be slower but be patient since it's only the husband and wife team that are holding down the fort.  

I feel like it's one of those places that people go to for years and get to know the owners and the owners get to know you, so definitely worth 5 stars in my opinion."
"PA","My dog is what we here in Pittsburgh like to call a Heinz 57 variety dog. In other words, he's a mutt. A mutt with a lot of fur. So much fur that sometimes I get stopped by random people condemning me for feeding my dog so much food, because he looks obese. True story. 

I used to take him to PetCo. It would take the entire morning, or afternoon, and they would charge a lot of money. Like, close to a hundred bucks. Which I'd rather spend on a massage. 

It's forty-five bucks to get your dog washed and groomed at The Pet Stop. You'd better tip more than 20%, though, because these kind ladies deserve it. 

Not only did they fawn over my furry little mutt, but they didn't even mind that I was a little late, due to getting lost in rush hour traffic. 

Best of all, my dog usually gets freaked out by all the commotion of the groomers at PetCo. Not the case anymore! He waltzed in, unfazed. Came out looking great, smelling great, and most of all, happy. 

An excellent experience, all around."
"PA","I am the proud owner of what may very well be the worst cat ever.  

She excels at two things, 1) being up in my face/lap, and 

2) shedding.  It got to the point that sitting next to her was like being inside a snow globe...full of cat hair.  WHITE CAT HAIR.  The kind that gets everywhere and is hidden against nothing.

How my cat can shed so much and still be covered in long white fur, I do not know.

She sheds so much that if my Dyson vacuum used a pillow, it would weep tears into it every night bc nothing can keep up with that much fur.  

My life was going places--going places covered in cat hair.  Then, I found the Pet Stop, and all that changed.  

Now I look better (I actually do, I'm only mostly covered in cat hair now), 

I feel better (also true.  Ever get cat hair under a contact lens?) 

and my friends say I'm much more fun to hang out with (also true, since I am no longer late to everything on account of my having to lint roll everything)

The Pet Stop is in Castle Shannon on Rte 88.  I called and asked if they would be able to groom the worst cat ever who is really sweet but a pain in the ass.  Without missing a beat, the woman laughed and said yes, they could handle my cat.  

Did I mention my sweet ball of fur turns into a sabre tooth tiger at the sight of a cat brush?  Yeah, thats the third thing she excels at.

I brought her in, and the groomer was very very very nice with her and took time to ask me what I wanted done with her.  Me:  ""I dont know, shave her ass!  Just fix the fur, I do not care!""  Instead, she laughed and told me she was going to bathe my cat and brush her out.   I wanted to ask her what her drink of choice was bc I was pretty sure the groomer was going to need a drink--and possibly a blood transfusion--after bathing my cat.

I wished her luck and went home to lint roll my clothes and do some vacuuming.

They called me a few hours later and told me that 1) my cat was clean and ready, and 2) she was well behaved.  I immediately asked if they had to tranquilize the cat and they said ""No, we never do that....""  So then I was pretty sure they weren't talking about my cat.

I swear my cat was 3 shades whiter and 25% thinner when they returned her.  She looked fantastic!  She also looked miserable as hell but this was to be expected bc she'd just loved her nightmare and also who cares--she looked FANTASTIC.

Here is the best part:  The last time I had my cat groomed, it was $75 plus I had to pay a ""Cat Behavior Fee.""  She was so bad I had to pay extra.

IT WAS $35!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You can't go around kissing people you don't know, but I wanted to kiss the groomer, I was so excited!

I cannot more highly recommend this place!  They do GREAT WORK, are friendly, and affordable!  Suck it Pet Smart, you're never going to have to groom my beast again now that I've got the Pet Stop. 

I posted a picture of my fat white cat so you can see what they were dealing with"
"PA","Before owning a dog that needed grooming, I just assumed you washed your dog in the tub and went on your way- dogs don't need that frou-frou stuff. Little did I know, but dogs need cuts, nail clippings, and sometimes some gnarly cleaning in the no-no parts. There are certain things I just don't want to do.
I have been bringing my dogs to the Pet Stop for several years, and they have always treated us well. They take very good care of my dogs, who are always happy when I pick them up. The Pet Stop has full service from cuts, washes, nail clipping, and lots more, and they are very accommodating on specific types of cuts. Plus, they always give my dogs a cute bandanna around their neck that matches the season. 
I want someone to take care of my dogs like I do, and I get that with the ladies at The Pet Stop- and they're pretty reasonable on price and timing."
"PA","Ordered chicken wings. They looked very unappetizing, especially after I picked one up and it had feathers coming out of it. I understand things happen, but the situation was handled very unprofessionally. I'm not sure if our server was embarrassed, but it seemed as though we were avoided after the issue was brought to her attention."
"PA","Excellent bar food and an extensive menu. If you are in the mood for great bar food look no further. Every thing is delicious qnd the wings are huge and saucy. Love it every time. KILLER FRIES AND ZESTICUE WING FOREVER."
"PA","As far as bar food goes, this is as good as it gets. They have your normal selection of bar delicacies, but they never cease to satisfy. I can't say much for all of the food though, because every time I go (and that is often) i get an order of killer fries and 24 zestique wings. They are both an amazing combination, and Castle Tavern's wings are by far the best in Castle Shannon. I would highly recommend this place if you like bar food. And their dining room is seperate from their bar so it is smoke free and quiet. Really a quaint little place. Excellent!"
"PA","A typical tavern with a basic bar menu of burgers, sandwiches, and fried munchies. The deep fried jalapeno pretzel is a great change from the usual fries, or cheese sticks. I usually order the fried fish sandwich, which is a great size, and filling. Service is okay, casual, and prompt. The main dining area away from the bar, is nice, and quiet, full of Pittsburgh sports memorabilia. Not a bad place to look around while waiting for your order. Love their witty signs they put up to get you thinking as you drive down Rt. 88 which seems to be a never ending construction zone."
"PA","Blech! Darren's often too nice in his reviews. The pizza was really greasy, and the bacon was minimal. It's just a little shack of a joint on a desolate street where you'd think you might meet Freddie Kruger after dark! But Darren was dying to go here just so he could review it, and it sucked, didn't it sweetie? ;) They didn't even deliver to us. I had to drive him there just to get it, and you can't eat in either. Cash only. Avoid.

We could have ordered from Slice, which I like and is in our hood, but noooo...

:D"
"PA","I had a mani pedi today and they were brutal....so painful!  Ask her to just push your cuticles back otherwise youre in for some pain.  She actually cut me during my manicure and I had to ask her to quit f ing cutting my cuticles it bled so bad.  It's like having the worst papercut you can imagine then it really did not feel good at all the one she put acetone on it.


I literally had to take my hand away from her and say stop let's not mess with my cuticles anymore! The owner was sitting right there and didn't do anything or say anything. 

now I've got a gold sparkly nail with a nasty ass, scab around it  she apologized but she cut my freaking hand I was really unhappy and I will never go back. Also see the picture of the lovely job she did on the manicure the color was not on evenly and it looked like a five year old did it.  The pedicure it was really good but it was just so painful if you can book with somebody else but do not let this woman near your cuticles and tell her to be gentle because she certainly wasn't with me.

Part of why I am so freaked out about being cut is that my nail got painted with that lovely sparkly gold nail polish while I was still kind of bleeding. That can't be hygienic I mean you should all know that I am perfectly healthy and hepatitis free, that is a communal bottle of nail polish! And I was bleeding! I feel like a kind of is a really big deal.

Please know that I hate leaving bad reviews. But they made me bleed! And the pedicure was really really painful! I would like to stress again though that my feet look awesome. The salon was very very clean and the technicians were very nice.

But I left stressed and bleeding!"
"PA","They do an okay job, but I find this place is VERY expensive and while they do an ok job, they don't do a great job.  You can find the same or better manicure near by, for half the price."
"PA","I would absolutely not return to this salon. My nail tech was nice enough, very chatty and personable. But the other techs there were very catty talking about everyone and their neighbor. The parrafin dip felt nice but the wax contraption was on the floor and very uncomfortable getting in and out of. Now on to the manicure. My natural nails were very long and I asked for a short/square shape. I got a strange mixture of short, semi short, square and round. The polish application was absolutely terrible, uneven and up to and over the cuticle with no clean up. I've never seen such a mess and can actually do a better job myself. This made me question whether or not she was professionally trained. I should have questioned her but at this point I just wanted to get out of there. I went home, removed the polish and reapplied myself. What a complete waste."
"PA","Everything about the pedi was ok except the polishing part.  12 hours later I had to wear shoes, and the polish smudged because it was slopped on so thick it never would have dried. 

As she was polishing my nails, I was thinking, ""Man, that is way too thick!  It'll never dry!"", but I didn't say anything because I thought maybe she had some super topcoat that would make the impossible possible.  Well, she didn't, and the polish stayed not just tacky, but downright WET for 4 hours, before I finally just SCRAPED the goop off and painted them myself.  

I will never be back, and wish I had saved my $30 (I had a Groupon) and my $15 tip.  Should have just done them myself."
"PA","Worst nail salon ever. 

I made the mistake of buying a Groupon for a mani/pedi here without really doing any research. Not a smart move on my part. The place was totally dusty and there was no AC. Being that it was like 90 degrees that day, it was hotter inside than outside. The manicurist, who was very chatty and nice enough for one star, didn't put any lotion on my hands, or clean my nails at all-- just quickly filed them and slopped on the polish. The top coat gathered in some parts and made it look thick and chunky- completely uneven. 

When I stuck my hand in the dryer, I accidently bumped and smudged a nail.....and her remedy (wait for it...) was to LICK HER FINGER AND BLOT HER SALIVA OVER THE POLISH. I just kinda stared at her in shock, unable to speak. 

Maybe folks in Castle Shannon are into this kind of vibe, but I will continue to stay within city limits the next time I feel like endulging. It was just a bad scene."
"PA","I've been coming here for years. Nice place for take out they do not have no dine in restaurant area but good prices and decent quality food. The girl who runs the register is super nice and friendly she always knows what I want too :)"
"PA","Very fast and friendly service.  This is definately a no-frills place and there is nowhere to sit down and eat in the restaurant, BUT it is a great place for take-out!  The woman/cashier I deal with every time I go up there always seem to know instinctively what my order is and she is always very nice and accommodating.  The food portions are LARGE and everything is always very GOOD."
"PA","I have always enjoyed the Dragon restaurant. The lady up front is very friendly and attentive and the food is delicious. Shrimp with Garlic sauce is my favorite."
"PA","The service is fast and friendly. Good size portions. Each time i have had their food i have enjoyed everything. Its not the best Chinese food if all time, but its good food for a good price."
"PA","This chinese joint is excellent, I must say! They are quick, friendly, and the food is delicious! I recommend this to every person who loves chinese food! Take out only i believe... Try the broccoli&beef!"
"PA","What fun!  My oldest (5) and I ditched daddy and baby sister to come out for the 2014 production of Nutcracker and it was delightful.  Our tickets (thank you Yelp!) were in the orchestra level and we had a great view of the production.  I was surprised at how many other kids were in the theater, and I think for the length and time of night I wouldn't have wanted to take anyone younger than my almost-six-year-old. 
 
So, the ballet. It was set in Pittsburgh, which was fun, and there were some additions we hadn't see before, like the mysterious Nephew.  The dancing was wonderful, as expected.  My daughter was confused about the lack of dialog, but the program had a very helpful synopsis that helped her understand what was happening.  The first act was fun, with magic acts, dancing ""dolls"" and of course the fight with the rats and mice, and quite enjoyable.  The ending of the first act was quite soothing, and in the dark theater I admit I was afraid of snoozing! 
 
The second act.  The national dances were amazing, especially the arabian dance (Holy cow, talk about amazing abs!!!).  Then it got to the point where the sugar plum fairy danced, then her consort danced, then they danced together, then the fairy danced...and it did drag a little.  I loved the creativity, though, of the carousel, and the imagination of the set and costumes.  There was a part with the lambs that was awfully cute, and we loved watching the kids any time they were on stage.  There were several ""side stories"" going on in the periphery of the stage that you could get absorbed in, and it was just very well done.   
 
Overall, I think that this will now be our Christmas tradition.  It was wonderful."
"PA","I received a pair of free tickets through Yelp to see The Nutcracker last Fri. evening.  I was very excited to see this show, since I'd wanted to see it last last year, but couldn't work it out with my (now ex-) boyfriend's schedule.  I'm used to second tier seating at the Benedum, but I was in for a real treat, since the tickets turned out to be for orchestra level (score!).  What a great surprise for my birthday, which happened to be that day! 
 
I really enjoyed PBT's performance of The Nutcracker!  Between the dancing, the choreography, and the costumes and scenery, I thought the show was excellent.  I've never seen a live performance of The Nutcracker before, and the last time I saw the movie was in elementary school music class.  Even though it'd been this long, I was able to follow the plot with very few problems.  I enjoyed the Pittsburgh-specific references in PBT's version of the show, which included a setting at a mansion in Shadyside and a Heinz carriage. 
 
I thought both acts were very good, and each had advantages.  The first act was easier to follow in terms of the plot, but I enjoyed the dancing better in the second act, which featured more of the principals and soloists.  Although the stage could get a bit crowded during certain scenes, the scenes were ones where it was either appropriate in light of the plot (e.g., the party scene in the first act) or where it was difficult to avoid (the final scene of the dream sequence).  In general, I found the visual impact of the show very pleasing--if you prefer more visually-oriented shows, as my friend who accompanied me does, this show would definitely be your cup of tea. 
 
Overall, I found PBT's performance of The Nutcracker to be engaging and enjoyable, and I'd definitely pay to see it again.  While this was the first live ballet performance I've seen, I thought that the dancing, costumes, scenery, and choreography very good to excellent.  I'm glad that this show is a Christmas tradition in Pittsburgh--it's definitely one that I plan on taking advantage of regularly in the future!"
"PA","This review is for the 2014 Nutcracker, for which I received comped tickets from Yelp. 
 
Overall, I found this performance to be enjoyable.  The first act was cute and it followed the typical story of The Nutcracker.  I didn't get why the one footman had on a Phantom of the Opera mask, but I went with it.  The dolls' performances were charming and some of the children were quite hammy with their roles in a delightful way. 
 
The second act lost this production a star.  But, unfortunately, like a previous reviewer of the 2011 Nutcracker mentions, the second act is still jumbled.  The second act featured some of the best pair dancing--particularly, the Arabian pair--but the purpose of the performances for Clara was unclear, and both Clara and the prince looked sort of bored throughout the whole act.  Where were all the sweets? Where was Mother Ginger?  I hadn't seen this production in about 15 years, since I was child, when I saw PBT perform it several years in a row.  I can't say if I remember these things from a PBT performance or from a version that I saw on TV. 
 
The kids in the crowd seemed delighted and lots of children (and adults) lined up during the intermission to take photos with the Sugar Plum Fairy. 
 
The weirdest moment of the night was when Sally Wiggin came up on the stage before the show is a blue gown.   I'm still not sure what that was about but putting a 50-something women in a princess costume is just embarrassing for everyone."
"PA","We went to the ballet on Saturday to see Moulin Roge.  We have attended the ballet for years and this was one of the best performances we have ever seen.  The costumes were unique and the story had some humor.  The choreography and dancers were tremendous.
If you haven't yet experienced the Pittsburgh Ballet you are missing out!"
"PA","I am writing this review specifically for the 2011 production of ""The Nutcracker."" Let me begin by saying that I love ballet. I have seen probably 50 ballets in my lifetime. Most of them in Pittsburgh, some in New York, a few in Vienna. I adore watching the movement, how these beautiful, hard-working people appear to glide on air... mostly because I trip steps and leave high heels stuck in streets (true). 
 
This year's Nutcracker was... bad.  And I hate saying that. Why so bad?  
 
Here. I'll do the ""compliment sandwich.""   
 
GOOD: This adaptation of Tchaikovsky's Christmas classic is set in late 19th-century Pittsburgh. It's charming to see elements of Pittsburgh history. Toys magically step out of Kauffman's Christmas catalog. A Heinz truck pulls up in front of the family's Shadyside mansion. One can see the beautiful snow-covered confluence from atop Mount Washington. This was all really nice and gave personal home-y touches to the production.  
 
BAD: The director took such dramatic liberties with the show that at some points, the ONLY thought that came to mind was ""cluster...."" you know the rest. I took boy with me, who had never seen a ballet. The only ""Nutcracker"" he had ever seen was the Macaulay Culkin version. He too, had no clue what was going on.  
 
Essentially, after leaving ""Marie's"" house and the first act, there is no sense of direction whatsoever. In Tchaikovsky's ballet, the Sugar Plum fairy rules over the Land of Sweets. There, Russian Candy Canes, Chinese Teas, Danish Marzipan, and Arabian Coffee live and dance for Marie and her new wooden boyfriend. The PBT's version of Act II is reminicient of Pinnochio's ""Pleasure Island"". One has no real idea that the dancers are supposed to be sweets, or why they are dancing for the visiting pair. At one point, the Sugar Plum Fairy gave Marie a tiara as thanks for helping the Nutcracker defeat the Rat King.  But there was so much going on, I barely realized this happened! The director added random butterflies, bumblebees, and hummingbirds... further crowding the strange. From what I understand, this was to incorporate junior ballet students. Frankly, I just found it distracting.  
 
GOOD: Drosselmeyer's magic tricks were neat. He was mysterious and sassy... perfect for the role.  Also, the dorky 90's dance moves performed by grandfather were hilarious. That being said, I don't mind ""livening"" up a ballet. The Nutctracker is a child-friendly show and little touches like this are perfect. The general set design was also beautiful. But it doesn't make up for the confusion forced upon the audience by overcasting and strange adaptation."
"PA","I give this two stars for the actual dance - they're extremely traditional in style and programming, and appeal greatly to the Nutcracker fans out there. Sharp, cutting edge, brilliant they ain't and their dancers are competent but lack style or pzazz. If you like little girls in pink tutus, you'll probably go see them. 
However, do NOT give them your contact details. They phone you again and again asking for money (on top of the ticket price). Last year, someone phoned and asked for a donation. I said I was busy. She said she'd phone back and did, though not at the time we'd agreed. I told her I had talked to my husband and we had agreed that, although we had allocated our budget for donations to local groups, we like to support the arts and so would like to donate something to their next auction. She told me that was fine, but would I give some money too? I repeated that we had decided not to give money but would donate an item. Was I sure? Yes. She then started saying how much money they needed. I cut her short and told her there was no money on offer. OK, I'll pass that on to someone and they'll contact you. I assume she was on commission. 
Months passed. Eventually I got a request in the mail for a donation - I fired off an email telling them they had never acknowledged our offer, let alone accepted or declined it. I got a phone call from someone saying Oops, passed this to someone else, an email saying sorry... I shrugged and decided to forget it, and them.  
Then a couple of weeks ago, I got a call asking for money. I stopped him halfway through his spiel and told him I had asked not to be contacted again. A  few days later, someone phoned me to ask what had been the issue, as she'd got a garbled account. I told her the saga. Strange, she said, it doesn't say on your record here that you don't want to be phoned; I'll amend that. After she hung up, I thought ""Know what? I don't want ot be phoned OR written to OR emailed. I told them that last year. Why do they have a record of me?"" So I emailed and said don't write or email or phone. Remove me from your records. 
Today I got a mailing from them. 
Mebbe they think persistence and ignoring my requests will wear me down and I'll start scattering them with largesse.  
What is actually happening is that I am now telling everyone and his aunt ""FOR GOD'S SAKE, DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR CONTACT DETAILS"""
"PA","Neil and I had a great time last night on the 'Burgh Brew Tour with Molly's Trolleys. The tour started at 5pm at Penn Brewery, then proceeded to East End, Full Pint, and finally Boyd & Bair Vodka distillery. 
 
Penn Brewery was cool as usual. We got there a bit early to have a beer and chill at the bar. Happy hour was going on, so 2 pints of beer was $6-- score! The tour started, and our guide gave us a little history about the place in the courtyard. We went back inside and had 3 beer samples (about 8-10oz each), a pierogi and a soft pretzel. The pierogi was delish, and the Penn Dark was the best of the samples. We all hopped on the trolley, and made our way to East End. The trolley is super clean and nice, and we got to do beer samples and trivia on the drive to East End! 
 
East End Brewery is a small operation, and they're primarily a growler filling station. I'll write my review of them, but it's a pretty chill place with helpful, hipster staff. 
 
Full Pint Brewery is way out in North Versailles. They're a larger operation situated in a big warehouse. They had 6-8 beers on tap, which you could sample or get full pints (hey, a pun!) of. The Rye Imperial Stout, Perc E Bust, and All-In Amber were my favs. We were supposed to get a tour of the brewing facilities, but for unknown reasons, that never happened. We still had fun hanging out with other peeps on the tour and the locals hanging out. 
 
Finally, after a pretty long drive, we ended up at Boyd and Blair. B&B are the only vodka distillery in PA, and they run a pretty small operation with only 4 employees. Despite the size, they've been wildly successful, and it was easy to see why after sampling. They make potato vodka from scratch, and we got a tour of how each step is done. It was great to have at least one educational tour on the Trolley, and the owner did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. I'm definitely a fan! We all got back in the Trolley which dropped everyone back off at Penn Brewery. 
 
All in all, it was well worth the $75/person for the tour. It made for a great birthday present for my hubby, allowing us to meet new people, taste lots of beers, and be safe while sampling!"
"PA","These guys really know their stuff, are reasonably priced, and let me bring my own parts. Amazing, will only take my car here from now on."
"PA","Great service, great price. Fixed my Jetta Diesel glow plugs in less than a day and was much cheaper than the Volkswagen dealership."
"PA","These guys are great.  They put the time in to really understand the problem and make sure it's fixed.  They also seem to be one of the few mechanics (the only one that I found) that knows how to fix german cars. 
 
I've had my 98 Jetta for over 10 years, and I know it has it's quirks, but most of the time it's a simple issue that causes it.  It amazed me on my recent move back to Pittsburgh how few mechanics here seem to really take the time to troubleshoot what was wrong with it.  When my check engine light was on recently two other mechanics looked at it and didn't figure out what was wrong with it.  The first had me replace spark plugs, cables, coil, and the issue got worse all while telling me I should replace it for a brand new american car.  They kept it fort over a week and finally called me and told me they didn't want to work on it anymore.  The second mechanic told me I had to replace the engine! 
 
When I brought it to German Motor Werks I got a good feeling immediately when I went in and saw how organized the shop was.  I told the mechanic that two other shops didn't want to fix it and he said ""That don't scare me none.""  I left it there and was called within 24 hours.  Apparently the first mechanic didn't install the plugs correctly and the car just needed a little oil.  40 bucks and out the door. 
 
More recently a vacuum hose for the secondary air intake went bad.  I know this hose is tough to get to and requires the front bumper to come off.  Terry was straight up with me and I thought the time estimate was fair. 
 
To be honest, at $75 per hour (as of June 2012) I think these guys undercharge.  I'm coming from the West where less competent german mechanics charge $110 with less customer service and attention to the details.  I really appreciate these guys' hard work."
"PA","It's a cemetery, what can I say. You have to be that type of person that likes that sort of thing I guess, but to be honest I saw many regular folks just using it for a afternoon job. It is a very large cemetery and would take a few hours at least to really take in. I didn't get through half of it. It is a very pretty places, with lots of trees. We even saw 10-15 deer throughout. I think it would be a great place any time of day just to walk around. Quiet and peaceful...with ..oh yeah.. a lot of dead people. You really get to see the economic lines between people here to. Some of these mausoleums, tombs, stones are huge. The money that was dished out in mind blowing. I enjoyed myself, and like I said. this place takes awhile to get through, each experience would be unique. Highly recommend"
"PA","The Allegheny Cemetery is the most stunning cemetery I've ever gone to! Appearing as a castle upon entry, you slowly drive through the antique gates and down the path towards the cemetery. You immediately see the wonderful landscaping that sets the tone for the rest of the cemetery that you are about to see! There are even picnic benches along the entry way for you to enjoy quick bite or a conversation while taking in the scenery surrounding you. The headstones are beautiful, intricate and unique, including the famous stone that has the JAWS cover carved into it! You will see your occasional jogger or biker, enjoying the sights of the cemetery and as you drive through, you can see the abundance of history hidden in the carved stones. The area is just purely breath taking- from the wild deer families to the trees, ponds and hills."
"PA","Absolutely stunning and peaceful.  You could walk through Allegheny Cemetery 100 times and see something different every time.  Highlights include: 
 
-Stephen Foster & family buried here, famous songwriter and Pittsburgh celeb 
-A mausoleum with topless sphinxes out-front on ""Millionaire's Row"" 
-Various burgh politicians 
-Special section for Civil War Veterans and a memorial for all Vets 
 
If you have the opportunity to go on a tour of AC offered by Venture Outdoors, do it!  The history and fun facts will blow you away.  Sneak peak - the first person buried in the cemetery was the daughter of the original cemetery owner.  Her grave is on a hill and faces where their house was originally located.  Cool, right?"
"PA","Someone call the health department."
"PA","Good, cheap diner food. They have all the diner classics served whatever time of day you crave them aaaand they have a bar."
"PA","Barb's is not pretty on the outside, but you know by the looks of it that it is gonna be good. This is a true Pittsburgh diner; the portions are big and the prices are small. Just the way we like 'em in Pittsburgh. I ordered an omelet and coffee. The omelet was cooked properly and had lots of meat and cheese on the inside. You will never have to wait for a coffee refill and the good thing is that the waitress didn't ask us every time she came by if we wanted coffee. She just kept topping us off every couple of minutes."
"PA","Thankfully, Barbs is in  walking distance to my house. This is a great place for your hangover cure, and your wallet will say  ""thank you sir/mam may I have another"" as it is DIRT CHEAP. 
 
Barbs does breakfast, and they do it well, catering to the hearty working class Pittsburgh appetite.  They have a wide selection of Omelets, and you can order biscuits and gravy on the side (my go to fat kid breakfast item). 
 
The waitress is spot on with coffee and anything else you may need.  
 
Everything was just what the doctor ordered, well, maybe not since I put hot sauce and mayo on everything, but thats another story. Unpretentious, filling, cheap, hearty, delicious."
"PA","I love this place! How have I lived nearby for almost 2 years without knowing that this little gem existed. Completely unpretentious. Typically dinner food. Admittedly, I've only have eaten here once, today for the first time in fact, I will DEFINITELY come back. Great food, pleasant service, amazingly affordable food."
"PA","Another great early weekday morning breakfast spot.  Clearly there are everyday regulars who frequent Barb's, the true sign of a good location.  I was impressed with the number of menu items (including poached eggs and grits) given the small size of the place.  Great service.  I will definitely return!"
"PA","Cute little diner hidden on a curve between lower and upper Lawrenceville. We came here for Sunday brunch, craving some delicious breakfast food.  I think I almost had a heart attack at how CHEAP it was.  For barely $4 you get eggs, a choice of meat and toast.  I mean, seriously!

I actually opted for the Country Omelet, which was ham and provolone cheese, onions, peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes.  It was an packed omelet with a crap ton of cheese!  It had to be like 3 or 4 slices!  It also came with home fries and wheat toast.  The home fries were okay, but I like crispier slices than what I got.  

The service was extremely friendly.  Seriously went out of their way to check on you, get things for you and just be plain nice!  It is incredibly appreciated.

I discovered no paper towels in the the bathroom and told the server.  She whispered to me that they don't keep paper towels in the bathroom anymore, but at the front counter.  Apparently people were stuffing them in the toilet.  Um, whoever is doing that, stop it!  I want paper towels in the bathroom!

Hot Tip: They DO accept credit cards
In the summer it looks like they have a super cute patio to sit out on!"
"PA","A local, down home Pittsburgh gem! If you are looking for a comfy, solid breakfast at an amazing price, Barb is your girl. 
 
I gotta say, I am a fan of knowing that I am going to get big portions and nice service before walking in the door of an establishment. Call it ESP, foodie intuition or a keen eye for restaurant signage. Either way, I got both. Barbs is kinda small, with an outdoor patio that they open up in the summer. Haphazard knick-knacks, dusty photos (a really odd one of an out of focus hummingbird in a wooden frame that confused my dining pal and me), and a corner TV contribute to the ambiance. Lots of locals chatting about sports and why so and so is an a-hole and can't catch a ball to save his life. If any of this is reminiscent of a relatives' home around the holidays, or sounds vaguely familiar, Barb is your girl. Or you are also a western pa native. :) 
 
I ordered the veggie omelet, tomatoes, mushrooms and green peppers with egg whites only, wheat toast and hash browns/potatoes. Nice, solid and tasty with a good amount of veggies. I'm always a fan of the egg white option as well. The potatoes were not doused in grease and butter, but pretty light and fresh and cut in nice chunks! Even though I gave the rest of mine to my pal (as I mentioned, the omelet was pretty big!) they were enjoyed! 
 
I would like to be a repeat offender of Barbs, and plan on asking the server what's up with the hummingbird photo next time. And re-ordering those potatoes!"
"PA","A great little neighborhood place.  Good service and a great cheap breakfast.  We will be regulars!"
"PA","Great simple breakfast.  Will become a repeat customer.  Great to find a place like this in the City."
"PA","great prices, great food, quick service! Will return here time and time again."
"PA","What a wonderful little greasy spoon diner. Breakfast special was AWESOME and totally worth the reasonable price. Nice little local place with good food and a basic atmosphere."
"PA","I'd personally give this 3 stars, but my boyfriend really really loves this place.  A LOT.  The food is a little too greasy spoon for me.  But Barbs is a friendly place and I do respect that.  The prices are right, the foods edible, and it's close to where we live."
"PA","I love little family restaurants and this is a nice one on the main street in Lawrenceville. A couple years ago they expanded and opened another room which serves alcohol. That room has more of an upscale feel, but the other room still maintains that small-town diner vibe. I've only had a couple of meals here but I was satisfied each time."
"PA","I ate here with some girlfriends after a night out, it was incredible. The dress code is anywhere from sweatpants to three piece suits and the regulars make it feel like home. 
Kitchen sink omelet was delicious, apple glazed waffle special was DELISH, and the white gravy? Flavorful and delicious, cheap and a great breakfast spot."
"PA","We've been to Barb's a couple of times for breakfast/brunch on the weekend. This is a very unassuming diner; if you aren't paying attention you'll go right by it. While simply furnished with older booths and stools, it is very clean and seems well maintained. We last went at 9:30 on a Sunday, and while they were busy it wasn't overcrowded and we didn't need to wait for a seat, which was a welcome change from some of the other breakfast-only places in Pittsburgh. The clientele was a mixture of ""hipsters"", families, and regulars.

As people have mentioned the food is inexpensive. Notice that I didn't say cheap, since it was very good. I was pleasantly surprised by the pancakes, especially given the price. They were tasty and fluffy, not bland as I expected. The breakfasts we had (mostly eggs, potatoes and bacon) was very good. The home fries needed some more crusty bits and salt but otherwise were very good.

Note that they take Visa and MasterCard if the bill is over $10, which is nice.

The servers are all very friendly servers, and our waitress last time was very efficient, as we needed to leave quickly due to an appointment. It was much appreciated, especially since she seemed busy.

Unfortunately it's a little out of the way for us, but we'll be looking to go there the next time we have a hankering for breakfast food while in Lawrenceville."
"PA","If you want a home cooked breakfast in a place where everyone talks to each other - Barbs is your place. Had a potato pancake which was huge and incredible. Plus some eggs and toast. The best part is that we spent our Sunday morning talking to the tables next to us as well as the incredible staff. Will go back as often as I can"
"PA","If you want a cheap meal that will get you through the day, Barb's Country Kitchen will accommodate.  But don't expect anything more than average quality food.  

DECOR AND VIBE:  Hole-in-the-wall diner.  It was clean-ish -- the age of the place shows.  Kitchen is visible from dining room, and it looked clean.    Basic booth seating.  A neighborhood place, you will see a lot more diversity in people than you will see in other Lawrenceville spots.  Comfortable.  

SERVICE:  Wait staff was very friendly.  Food came out very quickly.  

PRICE:  Five stars.  You could feed a family of four, with drinks, and not spend more than $20.  They serve a lot of items al la carte, so if you are not really hungry, you have plenty of options.  

FOOD:  It is what it is.  I had pancakes and potatoes.  My guest had a breakfast sandwich.  

Taste?  Nothing was especially great, but I have certainly had worse food at much higher prices.  

Everything was prepared well, and the portion sizes were solid. 

 If you are use to higher-quality coffee, you may want to pass.  

OVERALL:  If you are in Lawrenceville,  hungry, left your wallet, and only have a ten dollar bill in your pocket, this is a decent option for quick, cheap food.  But this is certainly not the 4 or 5 star place other posters suggest.  It is what it is, and doesn't try to be anything else."
"PA","If you like watered down coffee, margarine, processed cheese product, and soggy toast, then this is the place for you. They know how to under cook and burn potatoes at the same time. Cheap, yes. And it shows."
"PA","Today, we have learned something new about food. We never know that one waffle can take an hour to make. It is amazingly awesome to have one of the longest-wait pancake in an entire world. What surprised me more is the taste! It is so bland.

Ooohhhh...we also found a bug in the syrup that they gave us (please see the photo). Who doesn't want protein in their waffle!?


Anyway, the service is terrific! Why? It should be ranked in the the top ten worst of the world! Therefore, we are glad that we have tried this place. It is one if the life time experience.


P.S. How can I give a -5 on yelp?"
"PA","Delicious food! We go there for brunch. They always have good specials and it's great if you're hung over. Everything I have had there, I have liked. I do wish they had a soda machine instead of bottles. You can beat a good, cheap, local, mom and pop breakfast diner though!!"
"PA","This is the perfect spot for brunch if you are looking for a standard, greasy spoon type diner. The food was good, there was a lot of it, and it was incredibly inexpensive. Another reviewer said try to order straight off the menu because they will not accommodate you, but I will say the exact opposite of this. I was with three family members who all wanted their food made very precisely, and the waitress was super nice and understanding and the food was made exactly as requested. We also had a child with us who wanted something not on the menu and the waitress said, ""just tell us what you want, we'll figure out a way to make it."" Ok, it sounds like we were an awful table but I don't think it was that bad lol. Anyway, GREAT place!"
"PA","Lovely authentic diner with cheap breakfast food and cool staff. It's a real experience and great for hangovers."
"PA","Barb's is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It is homemade greasy goodness. Everything here is amazing at a great price. 

You can get a huge plate of breakfast foods or an amazing sandwich and I never pay more than $10. 

Their onion rings are the single best onion rings I have ever had. Most places just buy a frozen bag but at Barb's they cut, batter and fry theirs by hand. Its something simple that takes their food to the next level. 

Good old fashioned cooking like your grandma use to make. So so so so good. Try it out."
"PA","I hate this place... They don't have cheese all they have is this disgusting liquid cheese. I almost vomed when I looked at my eggs Benedict and it was smothered in nacho cheese. Our waitress was so rude!!!!! Gave us dirty looks and I felt that she hated her job and was annoyed we were coming to eat breakfast. Sat out on ""deck area"" and there were fly trappers hanging from the ceiling. Never coming back!!!!!"
"PA","Grosss"
"PA","Place was okay. Hangover food that wasn't the tastiest. Not the cleanest place either but friendly service"
"PA","The 3 egg Breakfast Special is now 4.99 but still an awesome deal. Add a buck and get turkey sausage!"
"PA","Yum, I'm glad that I've finally gotten to experience Barb's. Bobby declined for a month every time i offered since it's easier to just grab breakfast in Oakland or downtown. 

I've become a little non-existent on yelp lately due to my urge to learn to cook (& cook well!) I've been making dinner at home and packing my lunch daily, so breakfast at Barbs last Saturday (which was also our 2-year special date) was our first time eating out in a good month. 

I ordered the traditional breakfast; 3 eggs, home fries, choice of meat & toast. Bobby ordered the kitchen sink after I informed him that many people on yelp recommended that option. He was satisfied and I think its pretty awesome you get to choose the 3 meats in your kitchen sink omelet. 

Speaking of that, when I asked if they had sausage patties i was surprised to hear yes but even more happy that they had 3 different options in the sausage patty category (score!) 

There were a few mishaps but we never mentioned them to server because the food was still delicious. (minor mishaps.. wrong sausage, no onions/peppers on home fries after requested & never given an option on toast. we were just brought out Italian) None of these were too big of a deal, but I thought there should be a reason behind my rating... Im sure any of the workers would have bent over backwards to fix the issue if we had brought it up. Everyone was friendly! 

We'll be back and I'm sure next time it'll be even better. I have to mention the coffee is great and the cup is bottomless."
"PA","I went to this diner with some friends. I had never been here before but passed it many times never noticing it. By far the best diner in pittsburgh. If ur hungry and this is an option, I definitely recommend this place."
"PA","Amazing food. I was scared walking in. Looked like a whole in the wall. I told my friend who brought me if I didn't like it it would affect our friendship.  Best breakfast I've had in pittsburgh. My new choice"
"PA","One broke Sunday morning we decided that we had to enjoy our short weekend after a 6 day work week. You know, make it feel like we did something; spent some money... 

I read somewhere that this place is reasonably priced, and it's true. We had breakfast for $4 each; poached eggs (my favorite, I must add), toast and home fries. One option for also $4 had meat, too. Coffee was only $1.35 with constant refilling. The service is fantastic, unless we got lucky and had the nicest waitress in the city. 

We were there at around 1 pm. Two guys next to us were having lunch and the plates looked appetizing. 

People just kept coming in. The place is not big, even though it looks it from the outside. Large crowds came in and sat at the enclosed patio they have on the side. 
We are definitly going back to try other menu items!"
"PA","This is a breakfast and lunch diner, so if you are arriving after 3pm chances are Barb's has already closed for the day. This little diner is a quirky, neighborhood eatery where a lot of regulars and locals can be seen on a daily basis. Almost everything on the menu is made fresh. 

Our usual order:
Chicken Noodle Soup
Ham and Cheese Omelet and Home Fries with Onions well-done and Italian Toast
Three Eggs Poached Medium, Extra-soft Bacon, Italian Toast and home fries with onion well done

Sometimes we might add in some wings or some pancakes, but it is rare. The wings take quite a while to cook as they are made to order, but their flavor is rather good. All of the breakfast items are stable, are cooked properly every time, and won't kill your pocketbook. 

My only issue with Barb's is that they don't have butter. I will usually get my toast dry because of this fact."
"PA","How did I only give Barb's 3 stars before?  My apologies.

I was back last weekend for lunch with some friends.  I had a difficult time deciding what to order until I saw the lunch special at another table: hot roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy.  Our waitress told me the roast beef had just come out of the oven and it was even better than I dreamed it would be.  And with the mashed and that gravy?  Bullseye.  

I'd also recommend the Country Fried Steak I ordered on a previous visit.  It is a 
hearty breakfast that even I couldn't finish.

Service can be a little slow at times, but always friendly.  It's a great location in Lawrenceville.  I'll continue to return."
"PA","To be honest, I'm completely confused by these positive reviews. Our server had long, dirty, tobacco stained fingernails that were poking into our order of eggs when she set them on the table -- gross!! It kind of brings dirt cheap to a whole new meaning for me. And the food just wasn't very good at all. We didn't finish our meals. We just paid and left, and I'm pretty sure we ate breakfast again when we got home. Maybe we just had a bad experience? Or maybe I'm just not a local regular or a hipster?"
"PA","I like it here, and it's within talking distance of my house, so you can't beat it!  The prices....amazing.  $3.99 for 3 eggs, toast, hash browns, and bacon?  Wowza! 

It's no-frills outside and in.  I love all the ladies bustling around inside who have most likely lived in Lawrenceville their whole lives and worked here for 20+ years.  Props to one super-efficient employee who didn't let my coffee cup get below half-empty.

Daily specials are written on a white board.  The menu is much more extensive than you would think, with most items between the 5-10 buck mark.  The counter is a great place to sit if you are here solo for a quick bite.

The crowd is totally eclectic - hipster families, hungover 20 somethings, older Lawrenceville locals, etc.

It's no longer called ""Country"" Kitchen, rather ""Corner"" Kitchen.

Barb's is a comfortable place with comfort food at a REALLY comfortable price."
"PA","This is a one of a kind dive diner! Great breakfast food! Local, quick and easy! Our server BJ was the highlight just an awesome dude !!! Food was fresh and came out quick!"
"PA","All of the food here is delicious and very fairly priced. Yum! Yum! Yum! My faves have been a special philly cheese steak wrap and the gyro. The fries are not amazing but are good enough. The soups are wonderful."
"PA","I have passed this place lots of time but never gave it much thought until I read the reviews. So I went today expecting something great and was not disappointed! I got the gyro meal and a slice (more like a slug) of the chocolate cake and everything was delicious! The gyro had plenty of meat and the tzatziki  sauce was really nice with the veggies. The prices were almost as much of a treat as the cake! It may be the oncoming food coma but I am sure my bill was only a little more than 8 bucks. You can't really get tasty real food and be full on 8 bucks at too many places. Go now!"
"PA","Neighbor stopped by and asked me if i wanted a gyro from this new place down the street, said sure. I am a loyal Salim's on Centre Ave. But gave it a try. All I have to say was.. delish. The cucumber dressing was different, not a cool taste, but a more of a zing. Wasn't overrun by the lettuce, but the actual meat. Havent personally been in there, but will be going to see whwt other surprises they have."
"PA","Seriously, these sweet potato fries. It seems the trend on Penn doesn't stop at Spak. I stopped in randomly and had a great chat with the owner to the tune of the Phantom of the Opera soundtrack (courtesy of a radio station he once found accidentally and has since tuned his car, home, and work stations to).  I saw sweet potato fries advertised as a sidekick to the day's special, and decided to take the plunge. So satisfied! As I carried them over to where my cohorts were standing outside, across the street, everyone perked up and demanded to know where the incredible smell was emanating from. The taste, I can assure you, lived up to the olfactory hype, and the spicy ketchup (although not the best spicy ketchup I've ever experienced) was a nice addition to break up the practically never-ending stream of potato. (Trying to convey to you that the serving size = ginormous)
I hope this incredibly limited review helps convince you to barge in there and order everything on the menu, immediately."
"PA","We're essentially neighbors of the Quick Stop and I feel like we're there nearly every day. It's your typical convenience store, but it's very clean, well-stocked, and well-organized. As a bonus, I love that they have Donut Connection donuts!

If you're in a pinch and just need a quick snack or item, it's nice to have a good option that lacks the insanity of a GetGo, while providing nearly everything that you could need."
"PA","I finally stopped into this blatantly obvious dive bar nestled within Lawrenceville after years of passing by it on my way down to Butler Street. I knew before even walking in that I was going to have a good time. Very Irish. Very Pittsburgh. Very fun. And they serve free popcorn! A friend and I came in, pretty much took over the upper area to play darts for a couple of hours. The drinks are relatively cheap (although I was hoping for cheaper), the bartenders and regulars were very nice. The bar is CASH ONLY, but they do have an ATM in the bar. When the ATM machine didn't hand me out the cash I requested, the owner came right over and said he would call the repairman right away- however, it spit out the money on the second try. I'll definitely stop in again soon."
"PA","Kelly's is the one bar in Pittsburgh where I'm just as comfortable as I would be in my living room. Actually, even more so, since I don't have to pour my own drinks! Best neighborhood bar in town."
"PA","Great neighborhood bar. Incredible service and affordable prices."
"PA","Bars like this are why Pittsburgh is a neat town."
"PA","Very cool local establishment.  The wings are crispy. Which is a gooooood thing. Loved it and the dive atmosphere was great.....thx for having us.......suzy and joe"
"PA","One of the best places to drink in the city. Great prices and atmosphere"
"PA","It doesn't get much more Pittsburgh than this. Cash-only neighborhood bar where the locals mingle with students. Great atmosphere & good prices."
"PA","The Management and the sales associates at this store were AMAZING! They did everything to help me save a ton of money on my major appliance purchase. I highly recommend a visit especially for appliances,  but they offered alot of other household items at very low prices as well."
"PA","I have bought appliances here several times.
Recently I bought over $3,000 worth of appliances and it will be my last purchase from Sears and especially Sears Outlets.
Among the thing I bought was a dishwasher. My plumber installed it and said it was not cycling properly.
Called Sears service. it took them 1 1/2 weeks to come look at it. Said it needed $450 in parts plus $175 in labor ( I paid $350 for it). They ordered the parts and said they could come out in 1 1//2 weeks to install them. 
When I complained about the delay they said I could just get it replaced at any Sears store..... but then they said I culdn't do that because I had bought it at an outlet and that I would have to go through service.
So I waited. When they came out they installed the parts and then said it needed  more parts and another trip out to repair. (Remember I only paid $350 for the dishwasher- they must be trying to gouge Samsung).
They were supposed to be here on Thursday of last week and I spent another whole day waiting for them. No Show, No Call. 
After a month my dishwasher still does not work. I have made over fifty calls to Sears ( their call centers are clearly not in this country)  and waited at home three days for them.
Today when I call the outlet store, either it rings non stop or someone answers and immediately puts the call on hold and no one picks up.

Sears has very poor service and outlet store customers are treated like second class customers."
"PA","We call this place ""scratch and dent."" If you're looking for any kind of appliance and want a pretty great discount, go here. My wife and I bought our washer and dryer a while ago with probably a 35% savings (the units had tiny scratches on them that didn't affect the functionality) and a range/stove combo somewhat recently for about 30% off (there's a dent on the side of the stove...but it slides in between our counters, so who cares?? no one can see it). 

We're in the market for some more kitchen appliances and will absolutely be getting them from here."
"PA","Very slow service in an empty restaurant, average food."
"PA","We came here for dinner and this place felt like home to me. Not fancy, not renovated, full of people keeping to themselves having a good time, GREAT music (no pop tarts here) and friendly staff. It's a bar/restaurant and it's all basic, good food. Our waitress was friendly and attentive and they gave us our drinks in mason jars which only made it more awesome to me."
"PA","I  would not have written a review for this place if it did not just the other day provide me with the best steak salad I have had in Pittsburgh. It was a fccukdng good steak salad. Seriously. I want it right now. I have had the nachos, meh, the tacos, meh but the steak salad people, is something not to be missed. Also, for everyone who has driven passed this place and assumed it to be a total dive on the inside, it actually has a nice cruise-ship like atmosphere complete with a stage and mirrors in an almost formal dining room. Who whouldda knew?"
"PA","Stopped in here as soon as we touched down in Lawrenceville, out of the creepiest cab ride I have ever been on in my life. To my dismay, the band was super loud and disorienting me when I walked in, turns out they were talking about vaginas to the weirdest crowd ever. I was cool with it then. It was St. Patty's parade day, anything goes I guess. Definitely more of a redneck crowd, which is where my roots lie, so no complaints here. You're usual run of the mill, musty smelling bar. They had Columbus IPA, wet the whistle with that then was on to the next place."
"PA","This place is real. Hambones has character and a soul. It was here long before Lawrenceville was cool and will be here long after. 

Great cheap drinks, great service, great food. A place you can feel normal and happy at. 

If you are sick of all of the gastropubs and prohibition era cocktail bars filling up Lawrenceville, give Hambones a shot. Get a hamburger and a cheap beer and it will make your day so much better."
"PA","Well... I'm surprised they offer a brunch menu. I actually only thought it was a bar. Come to find out they have a dining room next door. Seems kind of like a diner. Which brings me to my next point. It was okay diner food. 

The brunch menu actually looked pretty promising with some delicious looking breakfast sandwiches. Since I wanted something a bit lighter, I went with the omelet loaded with veggies and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize it came with potatoes until I got it in front of me. Plus toast. Which is nice, but I wish I would have been told from my server so I could have ordered wheat... if they had it. The omelet was okay, but the veggies were still kinda hard, like it wasn't cooked very long. And the homefries weren't very crispy, which in my opinion is the best way to do them. 

So here's the weird thing. Everyone ended up getting their food in shifts. We had a party of 8, so it was pretty large, but we were literally the only party in there other than another four top. First shift got their breakfast sandwiches. They'd eaten most of their meal by the time the second shift got their waffles. The third shift was 3 people who'd ordered omelets. 

It just seemed odd that it took so long in between. I wouldn't have noticed much if it was by a few minutes. But it was a good fifteen or more. It wasn't horrible, because there was good company, but it definitely wasn't the best service I'd had. 

Not sure about the bar area of Hambone's, but I probably wouldn't come back for brunch."
"PA","I'm in a brunch club so I end up exploring brunch in un-brunch-like places.  Sometimes you're pleasantly surprised, sometimes you learn why a place isn't known for brunch.  Unfortunately, Hambone's falls into the latter. 

Our table of nine made up half of those dining at the time.  No real atmosphere here. It was pretty bland, as was the food.  

I had a pulled pork eggs Benedict. Sounds odd, right?  It was. Think English muffin with a fried egg and pulled pork scooped on it.  Was served with beautiful looking potatoes that were sadly lukewarm.  Really pretty though.  

Our food came out one by one in probably a span of twenty minutes.  I was served first and was actually finished by the time the last person got their meal.  And they weren't busy.  At all. Not sure what the kitchen was doing.  

On a scale of 1-10 I give my Bloody Mary a 4.5.  Hey, it's Winter Olympics right now. Why not throw out a half point?"
"PA","I haven't eaten here yet, so I'm solely reviewing the bar.  I always have a great time when I pop in.  Jeff and Lindsey behind the bar are super fun and friendly.  Drink prices are decent and I love the karaoke every other Sunday.  I'll add more once I eat here!"
"PA","I've only been to Hambone's twice and I would probably not go on my own volition. But when I have gone, it's been exactly as the rating suggests: 'a-ok'.

The first time I made the mistake of ordering a draft beer. While I've seen other do it since with better results, my Big Hop was cloudy, off-tasting, and definitely suggesting of unclean tap lines. 

Their bottle selection isn't half bad so I have stuck to that with better results since my initial stumble. I haven't tried the food, but it looks like decent bar fare. 

There are darts and games in the back if you're into that."
"PA","I love this place. Good food, decent drink prices, and different things going on throughout the week. The people who work here are always so friendly even when it is packed. Good place to stop for lunch or stop for a few drinks on a Saturday night!"
"PA","Ill give Hambones a 5/5 just because of its spectacular Taco Tuesday. At only $1 a Taco (and with vegetarian options) it caught my attention. I was skeptical of the quality at first, but after going for 2 months straight.. It's official.. IM ADDICTED!

P.S Angela the Waitress is da bombbb"
"PA","I came here for a late bite on Restaurant week, and man -- wicked good Mac and Cheese. Made with melty, creamy Gouda, and with bacon liberally mixed in, this stuff is the real deal. Also, for an extra couple bucks, I had a mountain of pulled pork heaped on top. It was like an extra meal on top of my meal, and man, did it satisfy. The only thing holding me back from 5-starring this place is that my and my wife's drinks weren't great. Cheap, and served promptly, but a vodka-soda and a Tom Collins aren't exactly what I'd deem ""hard to nail."" Still, I would eat here again in a heartbeat. Great bar food."
"PA","We randomly ended up here while driving through Pittsburgh. We absolutely loved it!! I had the Pittsburgh style salad with buffalo chicken.... One of the best salads I've had in awhile! The house burger was too big to be true (see photo), but to die for! Service was great! Only complaint was the meat to bun ratio on the cheese steak sandwich."
"PA","This place is my favorite bar in all of Lawrenceville. It is not uppity or pretentious at all. It is one of the only old time Lawrenceville bars in the area. 

When I was unemployed I came to Hambone's ever day to use the free internet, order a cup of tea, and maybe an appetizer. The waitress/waiters were friendly and nice, even though they knew that I wouldn't be ordering much. They even offered tips on where/how to appy. 

Everytime someone comes to visit me I try to take them to Hambone's. The atmosphere is just fantastic. Yeah, it might be a little run down, but that is the best part!

Drinks and food are cheap and good! They have live music and comedy nights throughout the week.

Stop in, you won't be disappointed."
"PA","A five-star local bar. We came for a beer (looking pretty dusty and beat because we are rehabbing a house around the corner) and we stayed for a meal. Have been back often. All we expected was bar food and we have had meals that are inventive and carefully prepared. We always feel welcome in the mixed-age crowd. We are curious about the live entertainment and game nights, but haven't been yet due to exhaustion from the construction process. Best meals are sandwiches."
"PA","It wasn't my first choice.  Industry Public had an hour wait and Pusadees Garden was closed.  But Hambone's was a sturdy backup plan.  First thing, the service is extraordinary, the people who work here are very nice and work very hard to make sure everything is right.  The food is pretty average, but still better than I was expecting."
"PA","If you love fried fish, get the Haddock. It is phenomenal. I also liked the deep-fried pretzel, and the server who was a really nice girl. The interiors are a bit dated, though. But then again, Hambone's seems to attract an older crowd and seems to have been around a good while.  I guess if it 'aint broke..."
"PA","I went to Hambone's on the Saturday of the Lawrenceville Cookie Tour with a group of friends.  One of us had been there before and gave us a four-word review: ""Bad service.  Good food.""  I'd say he was about three-quarters right.

The food was decent.  I got a burger (the one with blue cheese, I forget what their name for it was).  Fine but not spectacular; I wasn't particularly impressed.  The fries were good, as I would expect from a pub-y place like this.  To drink I ordered their hard lemonade and then a Black & Tan.  I enjoyed both and I thought the beer selection was quite good overall.

But the service was what really left an impression on us.  After we ordered to a surly waitress, she snapped the menus back with a frown like it was her job.  Remember that scene in Lord of the Rings where Ian Holm jumps at Frodo and his face gets all scary?  Yeah, it reminded me of that.  Then after getting our drinks we didn't see her for a good half hour, which considering her attitude I guess I wasn't opposed to until about half of us finished our glasses.  No check up, no ""anyone need another drink,"" nothing.  After that we got our food, ordered another round of drinks and didn't see her again until she cleared the table and brought the check.  She had earlier asked how we had wanted to get the check, which we first responded with all separate but after seeing the look on her face that that request had caused we quickly changed to ""whatever's easiest for you."" 

I guess it's not a good sign when you ramble about the service at a place for twice as long as you talk about the food.  But that's just what Hambone's was for me.  The food was totally forgettable; the service was terrible.  I would've liked to go again and try something different, but I don't feel like playing ""try not to aggravate waitress"" again anytime soon."
"PA","It isn't a dive.  But it isn't fancy.  It... well, it's ... a bar.  

We've been there a few times now and I haven't really had anything I didn't like, although there were a few things that stood out more than others...  Firstly, we were pretty disappointed with the Nachos.  They weren't bad, but the portion was really small and the toppings weren't distributed very well.  Instead of the nachos, try the porky fries -- they are DELICIOUS!  We were a bit skeptical at first, but hubby and I fell in love with the mix of cheese and the pulled pork.

We've had numerous sandwiches (all good, the HBLT is HUGE and so yummy!), burgers, and daily specials and the food is pretty good.  Tuesdays they have tacos for $1 each and they do a good job of loading up on the meat and toppings.  

They rarely have beer specials (at least on a regular weeknight when we're most apt to go), but the beer isn't too expensive to begin with so...

The waitresses are nice and we've had the cook come out a few times to make sure we liked our food.  Overall a nice place!

Quick tip: If you're... anything other than skinny, you might find it a bit uncomfortable getting into/out of the booths in the main bar area, but they are comfy to sit in once you ARE in."
"PA","Ate lunch here one day and the burger was solid, beer was cold.

What did me in in terms of probably never going back here was Friday night.  My wife and I sat down and when the waitress came over we were ready to order, she took our order with attitude, and when I said thank you and handed her the menu's she ripped them out of my hands and walked away with out saying anything.  I proceeded to tell her to ""lose the fucking attitude"" and got up and walked out.  

I don't expect A+ service from this place nor an overly enthusiastic wait staff, but don't be rude, rip the menu's from my hand and act like a total bitch.

I will never go back here on principle alone.  Kind of a shame, because I like the place."
"PA","Hambone's appears to be just another yinzer bar in Pittsburgh. However, you'll see upon entering that the ladies behind the bar are actually very nice and accommodating and their menu is relatively extensive and delicious.

I first went to Hamebone's to drink and was blown away by how attentive the bartender was. She actually came outside (where we decided to sit) and asked us if we needed anything. Very nice, considering she had plenty of business at the counter and could have let us go up when we needed something.

The second time was with my neighbor, Tate. He's been in Lawrenceville for over 20 years and personally knows the cook at Hambone's. He talked the place up quite a bit and we finally made it over one afternoon for lunch. It was, quite surprisingly, incredibly good.

I've been to Hambone's for dinner as well with Tate and was equally impressed.

Don't judge a book by its cover, Hambone's has a lot going on."
"PA","super cheap beer and deep fried pretzels. what else do you need?"
"PA","Hambone's is divided into two sections. The restaurant area in the back serves pub-grub like wings, burgers, ""hamwiches"" and most everything else that's fried or dunked in ranch. Like most pub-grub it's something to eat, not a brush with culinary genius. 

The bar carries interesting local brews on tap like Rowhouse Red (from Philadelphia) and a couple unusual varieties of Yuengling. However, the best way to illustrate why you need to go to Hambone's at least once in your life is this story.

Man to bartender, ""I need six shots of Jager!""

Bartender, ""We ran out.""

Man (huge incredulous sigh of exasperation), ""Out of Jager?!"" 

Bartender, ""We ran out 10 minutes ago--sorry!""

Man, ""Alright...gimme six shots of Rumple Mintze!""

Bartender, ""We got Rumple Minze!"""
"PA","went there for lunch and i had the skirt steak hoagie that came with soup and coleslaw for under 6 bucks. my wife got the fried haddock sandwich which was enough for 3.  food was 5 star. peppersteak soup was very good  and there is plenty oof parking across the st in a city lot. attached bar too that we didnt go to. try it out, its worth it"
"PA","Eh, so just to say upfront that I've only been here once and I would want to go back again- except I probably won't. Gay bars are always hit-and-miss, but after hearing a bit about this place I decided to stop in one night. Total dive bar, pretty smokey, pool tables in the back. It seemed that most people knew each other, which is great. The drinks were cheap and for the most part the bartender and the other people were nice and respectable. However, I unfortunately had a bad experience with a regular who just wouldn't leave me alone. And his friends and the bartender shrugged things off as nothing, which made me a bit uncomfortable. I finally decided to leave, and it is because of this and this reason alone that I will probably not be going back here. It's a shame, because I love me a nice blue-collar dive bar."
"PA","brewers best bar pittsburgh in. you going to love this bar and this gay men going to love you. you are drinking for free almost every time drink. brewers best bar pittsburgh. you loving it already"
"PA","Brewers Hotel is an excellent dive spot for cheap drinks, located between The Strip and Bloomfield/Lawrenceville on Liberty Ave. It is not a hotel in the traditional sense, but there are extended stay apartments above the bar which I imagine are mostly let out to folks in transition. Historically, Brewers' was dedicated to supporting people with AIDS and they continue to subtly promote prevention of HIV/AIDS. There is absolutely nothing obnoxious or outrageous about this gay bar; it's just a super chill place to enjoy a drink, smoke and/or video game (on one of those crappy bar consoles). On Tuesdays they have free pool and $3 pitchers. Our draft Straubs on a normal night were $1.75 each. Expect drunken characters and adequate, if not friendly, service. Predominantly older male crowd, but a welcoming/indifferent one. If you are feeling generous and quirky, bring along pig paraphernalia to leave behind for the barkeeper."
"PA","Normally I have no issue Pesaro's but after my last order I'm done with them. I ordered the family feast when the driver came I paid him $23.53 right after the driver left I noticed I did not get the breadsticks or 2lt of tea & my hoagie was wrong. I called was giving the run around about that's not what I ordered and I would have to pay $3.50 more if I wanted those missing items. After complaining about how often I order from them I was told the $3.50 would be waved even thou I had paid it with my original delivered order. When the 2nd drive came with the corrected hoagie & missing items I was told once again I had to pay $3.50 I was told it was put into the system wrong. I don't see how that is my problem when I paid the 1st time, if I didn't have hungry boys I would had returned my whole order. 
 
I paid the difference and vowed to never go back there they didn't care they were loosing a long time customer. The only thing they cared about was $3.50 and would not believe I had paid the 1 driver who I suspect kept the difference and also his mouth shut when asked what I paid him. Mistakes happen and would over look this is the I wasn't treated so rudely."
"PA","My mom visits me for pizza. Perhaps there are other reasons such as my charming personality or birthright, but the fact that Pesaro's can be delivered to my apartment entices her a bit more.   
 
Prices aren't the cheapest, but are pretty comparable for the area.  A fan of the fact that you can order  
 
Today we went the online ordering route which always estimates a longer delivery time, but I was pleased at the time it took to be delivered.  I also appreciated that tonight's delivery man wasn't smoking which I have had happen to me before (first I don't want my food to smell/taste like smoke second if you are having trouble juggling a reciept/pen and pizza you shouldn't add something else into the equation). 
 
As we normally do we went the make your own pizza today opting for a white pizza with hot peppers and meat.  The number of toppings is impressive and welcomed considering we pay for them individually.  The pizza was so hot you would have thought they cooked it on the way down Butler Street.  Only complaint if it was entirely too greasy - like leaked through the box + paper towels and left a puddle on my table.   
 
Stand by and safe bet if you need a pizza from the neighborhood."
"PA","First time ordering from the Lawrenceville store. Yuck. This place better re-evaluate their ingredients and taste standards because it was just blah. The Sicilian pizza crust was terrible and there was hardly any sauce on the pizza. There are so many better places in the area, especially Bloomfield.  Try Frank's also in Millvale. Amazing."
"PA","We've been ordering from here for at least five years. The most recent deliveries have taken an excessive amount of time. Tonight we placed the order at 10:25pm. The driver called us at 11:03 saying he was on the 62nd street bridge and asking where we lived in Shaler. The only problem is we live in Lawrenceville... Off of Stanton. It's now 11:37 and still no order. We should have picked it up, I'd be in bed by now. The pizza better be hot, but I have a feeling it won't be."
"PA","I ordered Pesaro's last week and it was great. I know a lot of other people have had bad experiences, but I really loved it. We got a large pizza with black olives and extra cheese. It was cooked perfectly, delicious and it got here in a reasonable amount of time with no problems. I'll try it again soon and hope that my opinion doesn't change!!"
"PA","The mozzarella cheese sticks were not cooked and taste horrible. The honey bar b que bites were burnt, soft textured and no flavor. The buffalo chicken was completely gross and the chicken was cold as ice. The pizza lacked flavor, cheese was cheap with opened canned tomato sauce. WILL NEVER EAT FROM THEM AGAIN. A COMPLETE DISASTER AND WASTE OF MONEY"
"PA","Sucked, ordered a BBQ Chicken Sicilian pizza and they gave me a regular. There was no BBQ sauce in it. The seafood calzone had more bread and grease then actual meat. And the service was shit. No more from me."
"PA","It seems that others have had problems with deliveries, however I have only picked up orders here before. Pizzas have been quickly made and ready by the time I arrived. The quality and pizza prices are right-down-the-road average in my opinion. I would recommend trying it sometime."
"PA","Won't be ordering from here again. The delivery man was rude because they transposed my address. I, very nicely, assured the man that I gave the correct address and again he shoved the receipt in my face wanting an apology.  I know this looks like a scorned review - but the pizza actually earned 2 stars on it's own. WAY too greasy and just okay tasting. I was really hopeful I'd have a better experience since this place is in the neighborhood. Oh well, you live and learn."
"PA","Got a meatball sub and fries for take out. Not the best sub I've ever had, but not the worst. The fries were awful and soggy even though I picked it up right as it was finished being made. I'm not sure about their pizza, but I'm not too confident it's better than the places I currently order from."
"PA","I had heard good things about the pizza here from some people in my apartment building. I absolutely love pizza and always look forward to trying a new pizza joint. After ordering and having it delivered, I immediately noticed when grabbing a slice that they pizza was covered in a rather large bulk of cheese. Then I could not even get the pizza slice out of the box because the bottom of the pizza was not cooked. It was so doughy and soft that it fell apart. Had it not been late, I would have drove it back and showed them. I attempted to re-bake the pizza on my pizza stone but it did not help much. It was probably one of the worst pizzas I have eaten in the burgh. I will never order from here again nor recommend it."
"PA","Went to a few places around a few surrounding neighborhoods and came across this  place out of the blue. 
 
Wow... from pizzas to subs, or hoagies as Pittsburghers say, it is allllll good.  
 
Not too much or too sweet of red sauce of this pizza and the crust is always tasty."
"PA","I've ordered from here twice and had two very different, but equally dissatisfying experiences. The first time the driver got lost on his way to my house which is literally on the corner of two fairly busy residential streets, but the food was alright enough and in the end it still wasn't late. 
 
The second time, however, made it clear I'd never order again. I ordered the food and it was generally on time, but for some reason instead of marinara for my breadsticks I got ketchup? Which wouldn't have been a huge deal had they not been bone dry. The pizza wasn't terrible, but the sauce was utterly awful and NOT the same as the sauce on the pizza I'd ordered the first time. I'm not sure what changed but I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone that wants worthwhile food."
"PA","This place was pretty bangin'.  I was visiting Pittsburgh a few weeks back and some friends and I hit this place up for a quick dinner before heading to our destination.  Bar is old and worn and just the way I like it.  We rolled in around 9pm and the place was already packed with folks ready for a rockin' show.  Nothing but smiles and good spirits.  Worked our way through to the stage and up the stairs for more space.  This joint is laid out nicely.  Bar up front, stage in the back and you can get upstairs to the loft for a view out of the fray and another bar and food.  One of the first things I noticed when I settled in were the ash trays on the tables.  Ash trays on tables?  Does this mean?  Could this mean?  YES!!!  We can smoke in this bar!  You can still smoke in certain spots in Pittsburgh.  Now, I'm not a big smoker and don't go all Lewis Black when I can't smoke but after living 5 years in a smoke-free city a little vacation to Pittsburgh just gave me a little more freedom for the weekend.  Smoke if ya got'em.  OK, back to the biznezz.  Bartender was busy but she was most efficient.  Hot damn!  They sell Bells Oberon in these here parts.  1 Oberon please!  Ordered a burger and it was most bangin'.   
I liked everything about this place. Food, folks, fun, nice layout. This place was a good call."
"PA","i went here for the first time last week. pretty cool place. there was a band and it wasn't extremely crowded. really, nothing that special but not a bad venue for a band, and prices were totally reasonable. not somewhere i'd rave about but definitely somewhere i'll go back! 
 
UPDATE. so i went back to the thunderbird twice this week. again, as a bar, nothing special, not that great but not bad either. but i'm liking it more and more for the music. apparently every tuesday they have space exchange, basically a jazz-style open mic kind of thing. this week was beatles themed and it was amazing. the second show i went to had a $15 cover, which in my opinion is pretty steep. but you didn't have to pay if you sat at the bar, which you could still easily hear the band from."
"PA","Cool small music venue in L-ville. Came here to see the NY Funk Exchange a few weeks ago and wasn't disappointed. Thunderbird is dark, dingy, and an intimate setting to see live music. The bar is upfront and the stage in the back.  The stage area has a split level kinda thing going on. Right in front you can stand and/or dance. Right behind is an elevated area where you can sit and tables and enjoy the music if you so choose.  
 
Covers probably vary with the band, but the Saturday night we came I think it was $5. Not bad at all! Keep Thunderbird in mind if you are looking for some live music in a low key bar."
"PA","Nice little bar with pool table & a great Rolling Stones pinball machine with Steel Wheels era Mick & band. Super nice staff and decent bar food. 
 
 I may have to go back just for the ""That's a Wrap"" chicken wrap with lemon hummus & veggies. Sweet potato fries were thin and sweet.  
 
Band stage is in a small spot in the back w/ two levels of cramped seating. As small as the space is, many swing dancers were cutting a rug when we saw Miss Tess & the Bon Ton Parade! Super good.  
 
Only downsides were smoking - and  LOTS of it and the dank/dirty ladies room with a rubber mat covering God only knows what. It's super chilly in the front bar in winter so dress warmly."
"PA","I saw a Bluegrass show here last weekend and was very happily surprised.  It's a great venue for bands who are a little off the beaten path and the crowd seemed really excited.   
 
 Like other reviews have stated, the set-up of the bar leaves a lot to be desired.  The front bar is long and narrow with barely enough room to scoot by to reach the stage.  Other than that, it is definitely a place I would check out again!"
"PA","This place is awesome.  I went to see a show there earlier this week and not only were the bands great, but the atmosphere is nice and cozy.  You don't realize when you get in that there's a whole back area with a stage and two tiered seating.  My friends and I got a table on the upper level.  

One complaint I had was that for some reason they didn't turn on the heat and it was like 20 something degrees outside.  And I get the whole, when more people come in it will get warmer, but even when more people came in, it unfortunately didn't get wamer for those in the audience.  The coldness was distracting to the show.  

I ordered the blackened chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The fries were amazing, they were fresh and hot and delightfully tasty!  So on to the blackened chicken sandwich (bcs)...I'm biased because the Harris Grill bcs is the BEST bcs you will ever have.  And I'm going to stick with that even after trying the Thunderbird's attempt at a bcs.  I don't want you to think that it was awful, it was really fresh and if I had ordered a ""grilled"" chicken sandwich then it would have been fantastic, but I didn't so I was disappointed.  The flavor or spiciness was not there...occassionaly I tasted a faint hint of blackening spices but it quickly vanished.  

I'll definitely check this place out again and I'll eat something different so I don't compare it with the holy Harris Grill BCS :)"
"PA","Not sure why Ryan thinks only unpopular bands would play here. Some of pittsburgh's local finest play here and draw big. Also nationally touring acts. They come for the good sound and the ood regular crowd. This place has well placed bars. One upstairs from the stage so you can sit if you like and not have to leave the band area to get another drink. And the other far enough away that you can still have a conversation but also hear the band."
"PA","Great Microbrew selection!  Great Live Music!  Great Bar Food!
I have seen at least 20 bands perform at the Thunderbird Cafe over the past year and have enjoyed myself every time.  There is a small dance floor for shaking your booty, club seating for taking it easy, and a surprisingly good kitchen that is open late every night."
"PA","I've never had a bad time at the Thunderbird.  The food is always good, the drinks are always well priced, the barstaff is always kind and fun to talk to.  They have some good bands come through, and some terrible bands.  Be careful of that.  Also, watch that there isn't a cover charge before you decide to head down there, unless you want to discover a new band."
"PA","sexy bartenders and WIRELESS! food and great happy hour deals! 
its like a black hole. once your there.. you want to stay there."
"PA","This is a good low-key place to hang out with friends during the week. It's the right kind of crowded--not elbow to elbow, but there are always people there who are friendly, having fun, and they have a serviceable pool table.  Karaoke draws and interesting crowd and is low key. The bartenders, particularly Christine, are nice and competent. Wide selection of beers on tap, reasonably priced."
"PA","I like this place.  Humble and comfortable. I like the setup with two floors that both look at the stage. I have seen local bands here and we watched the Super Bowl here too.  A good time!  I haven't tried the food, but there is a really great selection of beers at reasonable prices.  Being in walking distance of my house helps.  I should also mention that it's within walking distance of tons of other bars and restaurants, in case you feel the need to migrate or get some post-bar pizza."
"PA","Very long and narrow -- kind of 2 1/2 stories with a small stage in the middle. Not a great venue for seeing concerts due to the small size (unless the artists are really unpopular). As a bar, it seems like a fine place with the exception that they still allow smoking. The food was pretty horrible, but they have a decent selection of draft beers."
"PA","Awesome, get drunk eat some food. Awesome staff!"
"PA","Incredibly amazing grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken fingers, what have you! 
I really have only been to the t-bird for karaoke on a Tuesday but it is always a good time, especially,  if Pappy is around to sing a song or 3. The upstairs is better, as there is a patio type thing and you can observe the singing action below. Additionally, the place is fun..... I think there is a cafe scene painted on at least one of the walls. There is a pool table as well.  
Maybe I like this place best because it always brings in a mixed crowd... it is clearly the next best thing after sports."
"PA","An excellent place to go have a drink and not see people.  
 
The main bar area is incredibly narrow and long, and generally has a few people who have the aura of regulars sitting scattered along it. Such an odd mix of people. I've played a pick-up game of pool with a woman who wanted to join our game but apparently had never played pool in her life. I've gotten shooting pointers in broken English from a Greek man. A woman apologised profusely to me for her bad language just because I happened to be looking in her direction when she said something. Apparently, whatever it was, she felt the need to come over three times to apologise. More random people will be more friendly at Thunderbird's than at any other bar I've been to.  
 
For the location and kind of bar, Thunderbirds has a rather good beer selection and a number of beers on tap. And you can play pool. And you probably won't see anyone you know. It's not my favorite bar, but it's a good place to have a quiet drink. Unless there's a band playing, in which case you might want to go across the street to Belvedere's."
"PA","This place is tiny. If this place were a dog, it would be one of those small yipping dog that doesn't realize how tiny it is because they blast the music like they're Consol Energy Center, featuring JT. And don't go unless you're over the age of 40 because that seems to be the trend. Actually that's probably why the music is so loud...so all those elders can hear it!"
"PA","Live Bluegrass and fine Bourbon?  *Raises Hand*

I really like Thunderbirds, a lot.  It's not the best bar in the 'Burgh, but it definitely has a niche and does well with it.  I really enjoy the bands this place attracts and I feel they do a good job presenting them.  Sitting on their balcony during a show is a load of fun because the sound is good, but you can still have a strained conversation and have fun with your pals.  
Thunderbird also have a good variety of craft beers and I think they're average priced.  BUT certain music just goes better with Bourbon and Thunderbird does have the good Kentucky swill.  
So, I challenge you to find a place in Pittsburgh where you can sit back, drink Basil Hayden's, and listen to live Bluegrass or Irish Folk Rock."
"PA","Some definite problems as a venue.  There is smoking in the bar up front, which creates problems for people who want to watch the shows.  The building is long and narrow, and the shows can be extremely crowded, with most of the audience standing.  Often difficult to see the stage.  Yes, this place has a lot of charm, but they could do a lot to improve the space as a performance venue."
"PA","Very cute little venue to see a live show! Terrible food and service."
"PA","The Thunderbird is another one of those situations where I wish I could assign 1/2 stars.  So for now, I'm going with 2. 
 
I lived in the neighborhood for a number of years, so I've been quite a few drunken nights here.  Somehow it seems easier to tolerate on a drunken night than on a ""I'm just going to have a couple of drinks"" night.  My last visit was the weekend before Xmas to see some bluegrass.  We got there early enough to get a seat in the balcony and it was freezing.  I'm not talking just a little cold, I meant cold enough that I was still cold while wearing my down coat at the table.  BRRRRR.  I figured they knew they were going to draw a crowd and were anticipating the heat that would come with said crowd.  Ok, whatever. 
 
They definitely drew a crowd - when the bands started, it was impossible to move around at all in any area of the bar.  People lining both sets of steps, packing the balcony, packing the area in front of the stage, packing the downstairs bar.  It really made me wonder if they ever think about fire codes.  I realize that makes me sound like an old stick in the mud, but come on people, it was crowded.  And miserable to get up and move. 
 
It's also fairly overpriced - I ordered a couple of Stoli vodka sodas, and was blown away when my tab showed up.  Definitely not worth the price of the drinks.  And finally, only in PA, you can still smoke in here.  That alone makes me want to stay away.  I realize it's legal, and they try to control it, but it's been a long time since I've been in a bar where you can smoke, and guess what?  It's still miserable!"
"PA","Until recently the last time I had been here was about 10 years ago. I recall that they have some really talented acts coming through and that the Thunderbird was the beacon of Butler Street. 

Now that Lawrencevile is seeing a revitalization (yay!!) it's good to see that the Thunderbird is still a fixture. 

We visited for a post-family much needed nightcap in thanksgiving day. A few regulars were there but no bands performing. In all honesty I was surprised by the drink prices that are higher than some of my other favorites in the area. However, I would definitely return the next time I'm in the hood."
"PA","Cool local bar that doesn't take itself too seriously.  The hipsters were not particularly in evidence, just some Sunday night regulars.  The beer selection is pretty rockin', although my stout wasn't that great.

There's an Iron Man pinball machine, and an upstairs area I didn't check out.  
Would definitely come back if I'm in Pittsburgh again - would love to check out some live music."
"PA","Stopped here randomly on a Friday night. It was such a good, cool place. They had a funk band playing. A lot of really awesome people there, super easy to make friends and have a good time."
"PA","pretty smoky inside, but the food is good + not bad for seeing live bands"
"PA","Eh, hit or miss here. Seen some good shows and some not-so-good shows. The bluegrass shows are typically good. The crowd is hit-or-miss too. I've been here some nights where people couldn't move because it was so packed, but I've also been around on Saturday nights where less than a dozen people are sitting at the bar. From what I remember, the cover at this place is usually pretty high- I've come up some nights, looked in, and just decided to go somewhere else on Butler. I'll cross my fingers hoping that it's a good night for anyone who decides to go."
"PA","Ahh, where to start...this is a sad tale of an eh-OK bar with a terrible menu that briefly experimented with something amazing; fancy tacos. 

I used to do my laundry next door and one day while having a beer waiting for towels to dry, I noticed that their menu had changed. The food options went from boring old bar staples to fancy tex-mex tacos and burritos (along with some great apps and sides). It went from mainly  meat to veg friendly and even featured a vegan burrito (which was ah-ma-zing). For months I endured rain, cold and snow, douche bag bro dudes pre-gaming before heading to Industry...all for those tacos. 

Now they're gone. Just like that. The cook took an offer somewhere else and apparently ditched his taco shtick for some god awful, vomit inducing, artery clogging pile of dump in a deep fryer (I'm assuming). So, they've reverted to the old menu of burnt bean burgers and soggy fries. 

So, we're back to the same old Thunderbird dive, full of cigarette smoke, old grubby drunks, bad food and mediocre bands."
"PA","Decent dive with good prices and ok beer selection. Lots of local live music."
"PA","One of my favorite small venues in town. They're good supporters of local music, and the food and drinks are incredibly well-priced. I wish the whole place was non-smoking, but if you're lucky, the upstairs might be set off that way due to the band's preference. (Upstairs also has the better view of the bands.)

It's a reliable, affordable night-on-the-town spot where you can grab a bite, have some drinks, and hear some good music. And the clientele is generally very friendly!"
"PA","Danielle Staresinic is a terrific optometrist: friendly, thorough, and professional. She's the best!"
"PA","I have been going to the same place in Oakland for years but I decided to give this place a try because I keep admiring the glasses on people who go there. Like my friend Lisa, who always has the latest designer shades and looks so hip. Also, I heard the owner was a Lawrenceville resident, and I wanted to support a local business. It was a very good experience.

First of all, the eye exam was the most thorough one I have ever gotten! I found out that paying extra for 3-D movies would be a waste, thanks to a condition that I didn't even know I had. I thought the selection of glasses was also good, ranging widely in price and style. 

My only regret is that I did not buy a really cool pair that a young assistant tried to talk me into - I now realize they were way more fashionable than the ones I did end up getting. However, the ones I got are super light and have funky blue arms, so I am still very satisfied. I just plan to go back and get those other ones now, because this place definitely rates a second visit.

Tip: check the website for hours before you drop by, because they are only open by appointment on Saturday, so you can't just stroll in and get an exam over the weekend."
"PA","Being WAY overdue on my yearly eye exam, I decided to try this place out mainly because it took my insurance and was close to my hubby's work (he was coming too). Booking an appointment was easy and we were seen within a week. They called me the day before to remind me of my appointment which I always appreciate because I'm a forgetful person! The place looked a little bit older inside, but I'm starting to realize that here in Pittsburgh, older doesn't mean you're in for a bad experience! 

We were both seen by Dr. Shields. Although he is younger, he seemed very knowledgeable and answered all my crazy eye questions. The other staff were also very nice. They seemed to be up to date on all their equipment and even had a nice new machine to do the glaucoma test - one that doesn't shoot air into your eye. Bonus points for that! I don't need new glasses, so I didn't really take a look at their selection. It seemed a little small and I'm not sure how many designer pairs they sell, but I'll definitely check them out when I'm due for an upgrade. 

Overall, it was a pain free, quick check up. Worth checking out if you're in the area!"
"PA","The people who work here are fantastic, wonderful attitudes, genuinely care about your day and shopping experience. They also have an awesome olive selection. I got some awesome frozen veggie Phyllos and love their frozen section!"
"PA","While working on the job, one can get hungry. Man hungry and the thing about man hungry is this...greek yogurts and hot pockets can't light that flame if you get me. You'll need something more heavy duty, something that gets in deep, really gets the engines revving. For that you will need Salonika. Oh what's that you say? You are working all day on making sure some steel pipeline is put into the ground, well then friend...I have the place for you. We are talking, 12 cylinders of man meat sledgehammered into what they call a gyro. Spices so sensational, you will have Bob Vila jealous at your home taste bud improvements. The best part about this man meal is that it's man cheap. This will allow you to spend your real money on lifting your truck, roofing your house or just plain old football, man style. 

I give this place a manly 4 out of 5.  Don't forget to bring this man meal home or eat in your car because this place doesn't have seating but that's okay...because real men don't sit...they stand tall."
"PA","Between my first and second visits, this store was expanded and brightened up and it was even more fun to shop the second time.  Great deals on their label of extra-virgin olive oil, roasted peppers,dried tomatoes plus an amazing selection of olives and cheeses.  They sell the best pita bread I have even eaten- Kontos hand-stretched gyro bread.  I'm almost out of the stock I bought this past spring, and will be returning for a mega-purchase again soon.  :)  I just wish that this store were closer!"
"PA","Wow. Awesome food.counter service only wed-Fri. Super friendly staff. Great grocery selection."
"PA","Wow. Awesome Greek cuisine  Terrific Gyros.  Only open for lunch Wed, Thu, and Fri.  Unassuming place,  counter service, no tables.  Super friendly.  Great grocery selection to browse while you wait on your order."
"PA","All banks conduct legalized fraud, but PNC does it under the radar.  This review has been a long time coming, but unfortunately, you won't care what I say until it happens to you. :)  Let's start with ATM's, you wanna use one?  Then you better use a PNC or an extra $2.50+ fee will be added on top of what ever the other ATM charges you.  That's right, lets say your in Tokyo (only 1 bank in the heart of Tokyo will accept your card anyway,  all others will fail ) and they say $5.00 fee (in Yen), well PNC will tag on their own $2.50+ just because they can.  What dicks you say? well let me also say another thing about international travel.  DON'T USE YOUR PNC CARD INTERNATIONALLY.  PNC uses Visa which they decided to set a 3% charge too.  So spend $100 PNC will take $3, ON EVERY PURCHASE.  My previous international travel bank Fidelity has since sold out, but before they only charged a 1% fee.  Before you laugh and giggle about pocket change then picture this.  International at that you can only pull out up to $200 from, sub-track 10% (3%+ ATM Fees) of that and realize that it goes directly into the pockets of your financial institution, of which your money is supposed to keep afloat while they rob you blind any which way they can. 
 
Sheetz ATM surcharge free?  Think again, Sheetz won't charge you, but PNC will. ."
"PA","Heads up: I haven't been in this location and don't even do my banking with PNC, so don't put much weight on this comment.  (I wouldn't if I was looking for a place to handle my money.) 
 
This place is a neighborhood eyesore - has to be the filthiest bank branch I've ever seen.  PNC is reasonably profitable, so why can't they spend a little cash to clean up their parking lot, plant some new trees (they let the current ones die), and pick up the thousands of cigarette butts from the front of their building?   I'm not asking for a renovation of the place, but a bank building should inspire confidence in what they're doing inside.  I wouldn't trust these guys with the bowl of pennies on my dresser."
"PA","I had the worst experience with David in the pharmacy. I had called to refill a prescription via the automated system (which I will never do again) and then had my husband go pick it up only to be told that it wasn't ready because they had to order it--so there was no way we could get it before we leave for a trip tomorrow. I called and unfortunately David answered the phone. I explained to him what happened and he kept rudely going on about how they had called me earlier. I explained to him that I hadn't received a call--no missed calls no voicemail and he just kept insisting that they had called. So when I said I don't like your stank attitude) he threatened to hang up on me. I'll file a complaint with his manager about the mistake and his rudeness and I'll pull my business, but the fact is he'll keep being rude and my child will still have to travel without his medication. Stay away!"
"PA","First off, if you're reading a review for RITE AID, I give you some mad props. I give them because you're either genuinely looking for the best damn place to buy pepto bismol, sweet tea, and emergency underwear, or you just got your girl preggo and you need a test--FAST!  
It's Rite Aid. I suppose this place could be better if they served some hot chili."
"PA","Staff is always helpful and the place is well stocked. You'd be surprised what they have there! Great selection of food, beauty items and medication. Great little place when you need to grab something quick."
"PA","Fabulous soaps, friendly owners, and convenient store hours."
"PA","Jay Design sells gorgeous bars of soap. I bought several scents as gifts for family and they fell in love with them. They smell wonderful and come beautifully wrapped in ornate paper. These bars of soap make perfect Christmas gifts."
"PA","I am so glad I discovered this place! Cute store w/ a super sweet elderly lady who works there :) I picked up a bar of olive oil soap that smells heavenly."
"PA","Gorgeous, high quality soaps that lather well and don't give me an allergic reaction. I especially love their Holiday/autumnal varieties and scents. A store a few blocks from my house used to carry them, which is how I got hooked, but the store recently closed for business. Luckily I can still get them online! 
 
My only real complaint is about their website. It's a mess. Very hard to navigate. I'd love to be able to read the product descriptions of each flavor before committing to a purchase, but it isn't really possible to do so, unfortunately."
"PA","Looking for a classy gift for yourself or your family, check out Jay Design. The name says nothing at all about this great little find. Inside the doors from the old fashioned store front, you are welcomed into a room of soap.  Yes - that's right - soap.  Jay Design creates unique and beautifully scented soaps.  Even more unique are the vintage style wrappers and ribbon wrapping these little clean bars. 

You can choose from an assortment of decorative style soaps (think cupcakes, cookies, rubber ducky) or the standard bar soap - which looks french milled and so o'lala.  The bar soaps are sold hand wrapped in vintage papers designed  by a local designer.  The scents range from flower to spices to unscented bars.  There is even a bar soap for doggies. 

You can also buy unwrapped soaps - you pick the bars and scents from those out - per 3 or 6 a set.  A great way to stock up - I purchased six today!  (Now I just have to decide if I am going to hoard them all or give them as gifts.)

I had a great time chatting with the store clerk/manager who was very informative.  They can make custom labels on bigger bars or little tags on smaller gift bars for weddings, baby showers, etc.  

The pics are from their website - you can order online as well!!  

So check it out - well worth the time. :)  (PS. The pictures here are from the website - I will try and get pics of the cute little store at some point.)"
"PA","Great guys. Good prices on tires. No BS. This is the place to get tires if you live in Lawrenceville Bloomfield area."
"PA","These guys are great. Passenger cars are not their main thing.. they seem to cater to industrial and big truck customers. Also, they are not auto generalists, they're tire guys, so don't come here to get your muffler replaced. Don't let that dissuade you though. They're awesome at tires.  
 
They took a) a last minute tire mounting request b) did the job with extra care (cleaned the rim of the wheel so the new tires seat properly, for instance) c) did it in about 30 minutes."
"PA","I had a bit of tire emergency and with winter here I didn't want to mess around with subpar tires. I bought my tires on TireRack and the guys here didn't have any problem installing them for me.  25 bucks per tire and I was out in 15 minutes.  It was awesome!"
"PA","They are all extremely kind and do amazing work. Very impressed at the quality of service and work: I will continue to bring my car here if anything is wrong with it!"
"PA","Went there for an auto inspection, only to have them quote me almost $700 for ""needed repairs"".  I am no car expert, but considering one of their suggestions had been recently replaced, I called foul. Went elsewhere and was passed without issue the same day.  
 
They may be good mechanics, but they clearly drum up business with inspections.  I don't appreciate being held hostage."
"PA","I first found Vince's on an emergency situation. Note to all readers don't let your inspection and emissions lapse near a cop. I called as soon as they opened and they had me in that very day. They were also more than accommodating in the fact that my paperwork wasn't all in order but since I was able to prove that insurance and registration were current they were able to finagle some magic within the system to get me cleared and through. The check itself was done quickly and thoroughly to boot. When I was told I needed an new part to pass the inspection (exterior mirror, damn hooligans with bats) they told me they would pass me if I paid parts and labor that day as the new mirror needed to be ordered. I completely understand this. If you are going to put your reputation and possibly your state license on the line you need a guarantee I am coming back. What really shocked me was the bill. Emissions, inspection, parts and labor all came to... a hair over $200. I almost felt like I was robbing THEM! When the part was in they called me to inform me promptly and when I was finally able to get my car in the fix was done before I could get back from the quick stop a block away for my daily caffeine fix. Customer service is top of the mark here. These guys do it right. The only thing that might put a visitor off is the fact that since these are hard working guys who work in a primarily open air/open door garage they do smoke. I don't mind because that is one of my own personal vices (sorry mom) but a non smoker might be put off. I say forget the second hand stuff and go anyway cause these guys are tops at providing great work and some of the best customer service I have ever had at a mechanics place. 5 stars all the way."
"PA","I've been using Vince's for about 6 months.  It's true.  They do talk the talk.  I was very impressed with how they spoke to me.  They took the time to explain everything, and told me what issues were the most pressing.  That said, their ability to actually fix a car correctly the first time leaves a lot to be desired.   
 
I first brought my car to them for an inspection.  THREE days and over $800 later, I finally got my car back.  Immediately, I noticed horrible squeaking coming from the back wheels.  Assuming it had something to do with the new parts they had JUST put on, I ignored it for about a month.  When I did take it in, I was told I needed new brake drums.... guess they didn't check that during the inspection?  Again, 2 days and $130 later I'm driving away and notice how decidedly bouncy the ride is.  In addition, my horn is no longer working. 
 
I should have never gone back, but they were *so* nice, that I figured it must really be my car.  Recently, like a moron, I took my car back to them.  Among the things I had them look at was the horn.  They charged me $11 to replace a fuse.  $1 for the part, and $10 for labor because he, ""had to do a lot of checking to make sure there wasn't a short somewhere.""  Imagine my shock when the horn starts blowing by itself after I left.  i was getting middle fingers from fellow motorists the rest of the day.  I called and told Vince to just remove the fuse.  They did, only my door locks stopped working.  Took it back, now the locks work, but the check engine light is on.  Took it back, got a block away and the light is back on.  I called and Vince told me he'd check it out, ""at no charge.""  I wanted to remind him that he had, in fact, already charged me, but just let it go.  Needless to say, I didn't take it back in.  I can't afford all the repairs I have to make after leaving my car with them.   
 
In short, they talk a good game, but that seems to be the extent of their talent."
"PA","Peace of mind is worth a lot, y'know?  I get really edgy whenever the car is doing something it shouldn't because I never know how deep the problem goes.  The radiator on my ol' 97 saturn wagon was leaking, and I was pretty sure the car was going to overheat and burst into flames at the next long red light.  I envisioned taking it to a mechanic, close my eyes and hand over my wallet.  But then a friend recommended Vince by saying ""I pretty much let him do whatever he wants to my car.""  I thought, what kind of mechanic inspires that kind of trust?  Then I met Vince.  He and his crew know exactly what they're doing and they know exactly what you need.  I didn't have to have an tough conversation about keeping costs down; Vince told me he'd do only what had to be done to get my car running right and back on the road.  But when I came back to pick it up, Vince had been thorough and kind enough to tighten some loose spark plugs which was totally unrelated to the radiator.  The price was more than fair and I was happy to pay it.  I could tell that Vince is a guy who just wants people to have cars that work right and he knows that when you treat people fairly they will come back to you.  It's what I plan to do!"
"PA","Vince's is the best. I've been taking my car here for about a year now. They're always extremely nice and helpful. They always explain everything they are going to do to the car and answer all my questions. The prices are great. They will never try to sell you something that you don't need.  
 
They're always extremely accommodating too. Recently I left my car over night to be inspected, but forgot to leave my alarm remote with my key, so they couldn't inspect it the day they were supposed to (the only way they could get the alarm off was by relocking the car and shutting the doors). But Vinnie said it was no problem for them to inspect it if I just brought it back the next day - and they never treated me like I was stupid, for what really was a stupid mistake on my part! Most mechanics probably would have made me reschedule weeks later. 
 
I couldn't recommend this place more!"
"PA","I second the five-star-only reviews...the staff here are all very friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating, and the prices are very reasonable.  They gave me a great deal on new tires, and I get all my oil changes done here.  They're pretty speedy, so you can drop your car off for an oil change, walk down to Espresso a Mano for a cup of coffee & read a bit of your book, and they'll give you a call when it's ready!  Plus, they're just interesting people to talk to."
"PA","I can't speak enough praises about this place.  
 
I was traveling between Chicago and Providence and found my car's steering scarily unresponsive to my input. I stayed in Pittsburgh with a friend and spooked when I took it to a place that quoted me over $2000 and a wait time of 3 days (I would have had no place to stay!). 
 
I then went to Vince for a 2nd opinion. Vince made me feel right at home and not only was able to fix my car that same day, but he billed me for another service that solved the problem and only costed $800!  
 
If you're going somewhere else, you're missing out on supporting a local business that treats you like royalty and will be honest about your options."
"PA","These guys are AWESOME.  I've taken my crappy old beat-up car to them multiple times in the past few years and always received excellent service, honest opinions, and very reasonable prices.  They're also one of the only auto places I've gone to that doesn't talk to me like I'm a complete moron just because I'm female - everyone I've ever talked to there has been respectful, polite, and willing to explain things in however much/little detail I required.  Don't let the somewhat run-down appearance of the place scare you away - Vinny's is the best!"
"PA","Marne hit the nail on the head! my family has been going to these guys for about 7 or 8 years now.quaility serivce, they fix what is actually broken instead of throwing parts at your car or truck, knowledgable and always a good price. 
 
a good way to support a local biz instead of a chain!!!"
"PA","OMG I love Vince's! Vince, Vinnie, and Mario are all great guys and absolutely trustworthy! 
They are very warm & polite (so unlike many garages) and will be frank with you on what's happening with your car.  
They won't fix things you don't need fixed & won't overcharge. 
Highly recommended!"
"PA","My first encounter with Taylor's Custom Cuts was a great one. Bob was courteous, conversational, and detail-oriented. After a quick trim, applications of various tonics, scalp massage, and a straight razor finish, I left feeling like a new man. $12 was a steal for the experience I received. I've found my new place. Totally recommend."
"PA","This is the best place in Pittsburgh to get your haircut with the best price. Bob is very thorough  and an all around nice guy"
"PA","This is my go-to barber after having lived in Lawrenceville for almost a year now.  At $11 per cut, it is very reasonable and the quality is always top-notch.  The barber, Bob, is quite friendly and always has something interesting and relevant to talk about.  As far as the hair cut goes, this is among the most thorough cuts I've ever received.  Aside from a solid cut up top, he will always trim my eyebrows AND my nostril hairs.  Yes the latter part sounds disgusting, but he takes care of it for ya (after sanitizing his tools of course before and after).  After all of this, he ends the cut with a straight razor shave with warm shaving cream on the back of the neck and around the edges of the hair line.  If you're looking for a manly place to get your hair cut, skip the hit-or-miss (and sometimes emasculating) chains like Supercuts and head on down to Taylor's Custom Cuts on Butler St. in artsy Lawrenceville!"
"PA","I'm more than a little wary of cheap ny-style pizza.  I've made my way through a few different Lawrenceville spots and mostly felt pretty underwhelmed.  Greasy and boring seemed to be the trend, but I was very surprised by how I just couldn't stop eating the large cheese we got from Supreme Pizza!  I think it's the crust, super tasty, chewy, delicious.  I'm looking forward to going back."
"PA","Great Pizza, Great Price, Great People. 
 
From street view this family owned pizza shop would not have been my fist choice, but I was being treated so I did not object. The white pizza was really good, I couldn't get enough. The seats were not very comfy and the decor is nothing to write about, but they made up for it with their service!"
"PA","This is definitely a hot dog joint that's been around for a while and has resisted change it's entire life. Frankie's is a hot dog joint and that's all you're going to get. The hot dogs? They're okay but they're cheap. What you mostly go to Frankie's for is the conversation and the fact that a little hot dog joint sells some pretty cheap beer. You can chill out with some guys you know've been going to Frankie's their whole life and talk about whatever's on your mind. I fancy the T-shirts they sell and want to get one some day."
"PA","Probably the best thing I ate in Pittsburgh was a sausage sandwich from here. It was so simple and a touch spicy, just perfect. This was the real food I imagined when I planned my trip here. The staff was delightful and excited about their food. It's a total shithole, but in a beautiful way. I love Frankies."
"PA","Hardy old school sandwiches. 
 
If you have a serious no-nonsense hunger, this is the place for lunch.  
 
Meatball subs, hot sausage, kielbasa and hot dogs for like $2.75. 
 
Greasy and delicious."
"PA","The chili sauce has a little bit of a sweet hint to it.  I would prefer it to be a bit spicier, but all in all the foot longs are pretty good.  I got mine with ketchup,mustard,chili and cheese.  All ""sandwiches"" as they call them are $2.75 Meatball,footlongs (hotdogs),sausages.  Its 50 cents extra each for chili and for cheese.  Wish they had french fries too :(  They do have a space to eat in there, but I got mine to go.  I believe they are cash and carry only...no debit or credit cards."
"PA","I was so looking forward to this d fashion place , but was kind of disappointed. Footling bun was dry and cold. I thought  it would be grilled. The dinning room felt like a tomb. Dirty walls, ceiling caving in etc.
  I was also expecting a nice sweet cup of fountain coke in a waxed cup, but was given a can of coke instead . I said ""no thanks"" and got water instead . The owner is no longer on premises, maybe that's the reason."
"PA","Nothing fancy, but damn. Get me a footlong with kraut and I'm good to go. 

This restaurant is not for the food snob, or for someone looking for any kind of dining atmosphere. The menu is a little sparse. Realest hot dog joint in town."
"PA","Best service and food I've ever experienced from a ""dive bar"". I ordered a hot sausage sandwich to go before I was late for a hair appointment next door and was disappointed to find out they only accepted cash. I never carry cash on me but the server gave me the sandwich for free! And it was absolutely delicious! I'll be back....with cash!"
"PA","This place was awesome, cranky old man bar definitely. The staff was friendly and to the point. If you want a cocktail and talk to your fiends, go to franktuary, if you want to eat a good hotdog and drink a cheap beer, come here. 

Only downside is the hours, I could totally see myself eating a hotdog of shame here at 1 AM"
"PA","This place never disappoints, it's dirty grungy and tasty. All sandwiches are $3.50. I love the hot sausage, got it today but they also had stuffed peppers today for $1 that was also really good. If u want comfort food cheap in a family owned establishment this is the place.  Would so a dinner here but great for lunch."
"PA","Darren  Hit The Nail on the head ! This Place REALLY ROCKS !  
Everyone looks like they  enjoy their Jobs here ...
  Myself and Eleven co-workers stopped this afternoon and ordered 12 Hot Sausages.
We were in and out in less than 10 Min.TOPPS,,,, DAMN They were good !
we might make this our NEW Thursday Lunch spot!
**** SUPER*** Fast and  very reasonable prices. I will be trying the Meatball & Foot Long Hot Dog on my next trip !

You really sould try this place if you like food that will kill you. ( Like I Do ! )"
"PA","I'd like to be clear regarding the fact that this is a review of a hot dog based fast food restaurant, so take it with a grain of sodium, an acceptable level of animal feces, hair, and dermis, and whatever managed to stick to the pig as they were plunging it screaming into the merciless teeth of a meat grinder.  Hot dogs taste good to us for some reason.  It defies logic.  I've pondered the nature of hot dogs in western cuisine, and have found that it's the same as gazing into Nietzche's abyss.  The hot dog will gaze back at you.

These hot dogs, like so many before them taste exactly like hot dogs.  There will be no surprises there.  But somehow the communication pipeline broke down when my group ordered more than one hot dog to split between the three of us.  I enjoy a little bit of sass with my hot dogs, but I would still like to have my two hot dogs please.  Somehow, even though I wanted ketchup and mustard, I had to keep saying it until it became a mantra.  So, the service was a little rough, but I really wasn't expecting the white gloves.

Nor was I expecting the intense battle that was raged between the spirit of that brave pig, and my body.  Ghost pig eventually won his battle with my dignity.  I'll spare you the details.  

Long story short, I feel like maybe this place needs to have some health related upgrades.

So in short, Frankie's is good for hot dogs, but possibly bad for your insides."
"PA","You really cant beat frankies for fast cheap food.you can smell them cooking atleast 2 blocks away . a staple of butler street in my opinion. hot dogs ,sauage, meatball what ever you get its good. its a dive of a place... bar on one side food on the other with a small back room to eat 'and where the hell else in pittsburgh are you going to find pineapple pop?!?"
"PA","I got here on a Thursday shortly after they opened, around noon. Parking is around back, there is some on the street but not much.  
 
Took a seat at the bar and had their lunch burger special, it seemed like it would be spicy based on the menu but wasn't too much burn. Overall the burger was good and made a nice meal. The beer is all brewed on site and I tried a couple drafts. The Thunderhop IPA was good as was the Absolution Ale."
"PA","Delicious dunkel"
"PA","Nice atmosphere. The prices are a bit expensive for what you actually get.  The beer is good, though. The wait staff is ok, not super excited to see customers, but what do you expect. Food was ok."
"PA","This is the kind of place to show visitors to Pittsburgh since it is ""quirky"" and ""unique,"" and it seems to be a hit with visitors - and indeed, the ambiance is quite nice.  However the food quality is sub-par especially with regards to the elevated prices for 4 boiled pierogies or a $13 ""Pittsburgh salad.""  If memory serves correctly, the pizza is a decent option for dining but it is not found on the main dinner menu.  The beer selection is OK, they offer an interesting sampling flight.  No reservations on the weekends."
"PA","I definitely recommend this place to anyone who has not been here yet. The venue is quite unique as you can imagine, and it is an experience you don't want to miss out on whether you are a local or just visiting the area. I tried the pizza last night, and it was very good, as were the appetizers I have tried in the past. The service was also good. That being said, I would not make this place my go-to spot unless you tend to regularly go out with large groups. The venue is the best part of the experience, and there is no need to re-experience it on a regular basis."
"PA","I heard a lot of great things about this place from other friends so for my Mother's birthday I figured we would give it a try. It was OK. I feel the food is WAY over priced for what you get, not to mention the menu is very small. The beer was alright but our waitress said she was new to Pittsburgh so she forgot some of the references to the beer, and one keg kicked so we weren't able to taste a full sampling. I'm glad we got to experience the place, very cool architecture and great atmosphere but the food was so-so, I feel like there are many other places in Pittsburgh were the food is much better for a lower price."
"PA","The architecture is beautiful and the beer is awesome.  Food is good too, just a little over-priced as some others have mentioned.  The huge downfall of this place is the service.  I've been here on multiple occasisions and the staff is always rude and cold.  I'm not sure if it could be because I'm in my young 20's and maybe they are nicer to ""adults"", but never-the-less, service should not be compromised depending on the patron.  They always seem to be in a generally bad mood, and extremely bothered at any simple request like getting me another beer!  I'm sorry I thought that was the main part of your job.  Anyway, I would probably never come back here if the beer wasn't as good as it is and if I wasn't a beer enthusiast, simply because of the terrible service."
"PA","Long wait, good food, good beer. Nice atmosphere, bit over priced.  Service was just okay."
"PA","The atmosphere of this place is 1 of a kind.  Maybe it's because I'm Jewish, but I've never seen a Church with a Brewery inside.    Additionally, the architecture is unbelievable. 
 
The jambalaya was delicious, but a bit overpriced (given the type of restaurant, in my opinion).   
Alternatively, the wood-fired brick oven pizzas never disappointed!   
The beers always satisfied my picky craft-only-beer-drinking boyfriend. 
 
The service wasn't always 100%, but it never hindered us from returning with high hopes!"
"PA","I have always been a fan of the Church Brew Works and have been visiting the establishment for most of my adult life.  As a person who grew up in a Catholic church what's not to love?  I practically worship beer, so beer being on center stage on the altar conjures up something special when I walk through those heavy wooden doors.  I almost wish they put beer in the white marble holy water fonts to make the sign of the cross as you enter. 
Now for my latest experience as it's been probably three years since I have attended church due to travels and living abroad.   
My parents were in town and my dad loves everything about the beer making process, especially the consumption part.  It was also my wife's birthday and she too loves good beer, so to the Church we went. 
Everyone minus me hadn't been there before, so there was a bit of awe factor for the noobs.  Though we were all a bit disappointed with generic wreath hanging on the plexi-glass barrier guarding the altar.  I don't remember this barrier in my prior visits, a small negative, but a negative none-the-less.   
We were seated in a heavy traffic area at a small table, which we requested later to be moved to more cozy location.  This request was met graciously and as a former server I understand you have to try to seat someone in those places.... 
We all ordered our beers and my father requested the Sour Piet.  Much to his dismay they returned with our beers and three samples glass of beers that were not Sour Piet.  He was informed that had kicked the keg earlier, but hadn't known.  He tasted the other beers and decided to get the Thunderhop (my favorite).  We only had Thunderhops and Cherry Saisons.  Both were very good, as per usual.  Disappointing that they had run out of the Sour, and a little miffed that our server was not privy to it being gone, but again just a little negative. 
We ordered two large pizzas -- The Cinco Formaggio and the Wild Boar BBQ.  Both were cooked perfectly in their amazing brick oven.  The pizzas were a bit too salty for our standards and they seemed to skimp on some of the ingredients so the balance was lost a little.  The Wild Boar was very good, but it lacked something, maybe spice or tang.  I think there was only a few slivers of the red onions on it....Again a small disappointment.  
After polishing off the majority of our pizzas my dad asked our server to fill up a 64oz growler with the Cherry Saison.  The server acted like this would be near impossible since it was a seasonal and limited brew, but said he'd try.  He returned triumphantly and bragged about how he'd done us a favor since they were out of Sour Piet.  An obvious ploy to get a little added to his tip, but again a small disappointment. 
I hope you caught on to the trend of a lot of little disappointments added up to make it a good experience, but not great.  I usually go after work for beers and pizzas with friends, for this it never disappoints.  But for a special occasion with family that has higher standard it left a little to be desired.  
 Our experience was 3 stars, but because of all my fond memories I gave it 4.  Be sure to visit if you haven't, but don't expect perfection."
"PA","I was going to just give four stars because of the skimpy cheese in the Greek salad and the small size of the delicious polenta, but then I got a sip of the sleigh wrecker! Deliciously bitter and strong. Let it warm awhile as it's served too cold--the flavor definitely comes out even more as it warms up. Come early on Saturdays--it gets packed."
"PA","great food. one of the most unique locations i have been to. beer is above average. the whole experience is amazing. I will always be coming back to this place, unless they turn it into a church again....."
"PA","Came early on a Saturday night with a party of 5, including a 6-year-old. Had a wonderful experience in this reclaimed Catholic church. 
 
We started at the bar, where we sampled some of the beers--the Celestial Gold, the the Cherry Quadzilla, and the Pious Monk Dunkel. All were fine, and there's something to be said for having a beer with Saints Patrick and Bridget watching over you... 
 
For dinner, two of us got the price fixe menu, which included the Cajun risotto fritters as an appetizer. Now sometimes with PF setups, each component is a little smaller than the separate item on the full menu. Not here. Another of us had gotten the fritters separately, and there were just as many as in the PF menu. (And they were awesome--light, spicy, crunchy on the outside.) 
 
For entrees, we had the strip steak, the seafood mac and cheese, the pork tenderloin, and plain buttered pasta for my nephew. We were served quickly and professionally, and my God, was the food good. And we were so stuffed that we had to bring home the desserts. (Malted bread pudding a la mode, and it was good for breakfast the next day!) Saints Michael and Margaret Mary were our guardians during dinner, and they approved. 
 
It's not the cheapest place in Pittsburgh, but the food and atmosphere is worth every penny. The place was packed by the time we left, which is a good sign."
"PA","Ambience was amazing. We were seated quickly on a Saturday night. Food however very disappointing. The ""Belgium"" fries were soggy and pizza was cold and doughy.  We spoke to manager and he didn't seem to care.  Come for the beer and atmosphere but not the food."
"PA","It may feel slightly...different...dining in the middle of a church -- but if it's no longer being used as a house of worship, I think the restaurant is a wonderful use of a beautiful building that might otherwise be abandoned or no longer exist. (Read: I don't think Jesus minds. Just my opinion.) I love it here, and I try to convince my family to go every time I come home (I'm from Pittsburgh). We usually start with the spinach, feta and smoked gouda dip, which is delicious -- so rich, but so good. The hummus and wood-fired flatbread is also quite tasty. I normally order the grilled turkey and watercress salad, which has the most delicious cranberry dressing -- I always want to buy a bottle of it. The dried sweet potato curls are the perfect accent, too -- they add salt and crunch. All in all, this is an excellent meal salad -- it's hearty and filling. The staff has always been attentive and friendly, in my experience."
"PA","Really cool concept, but nothing too original here. In Pittsburgh, there are bars, condos, concert venues, etc that were all once churches. The beer is great - get the munk dunkel, skip the mole stout - and you can take home a pony too!"
"PA","Is there anything more wrong their drinking beer at church? Yeah my pure enjoyment of the debauchery, why did my beer taste so much better in a church? Wine never does. And not only was my brew delicious it was priced right, my 2 fantastic pints were between $2.50 and $4.50 and both on point.  
 
So as far as grub... It was way overpriced. We had Pierogies, which from my understanding are unique to the Burgh, they were delicious for four $3.25 for potato and cheese and $7.00 for Sausage and sauerkraut which was amazing. I had the Jambalaya which was pretty good, but not $18.00 good. So while the food and drink was good the price needs help, at least on the food.  
 
Beautiful Church by they way I hope you heathens enjoy drinking your wicked brew in it as much as I did."
"PA","Magnificent building!  So thankful they saved the building and provided another unique dining choice.  I've sat next to nuns, I've sat next to priests, I've been to the Church Brew Works with my mom and grandmother...and we all loved it.  Granted I have seen people walk in and spin on their heels to get out as quick as possible after seeing the placement of the brewing equipment, but that is so very rare.   
I often have people in town for business and this is almost always on my tour of Pittsburgh."
"PA","Hit this place up on a weekend trip to PA. First off, let me explain that up until 1996, this place was a church and a beautiful one at that. Even though they brew their own been on the former alter, store their liquor in the old confessionals, and make their pizza pies where the old organ used to play, they kept all the stained glass, high ceilings, and rose window from this place. While I did feel somewhat sinful eating and drinking there, my experience here was excellent.  
 
We had been drinking all day, so that did not stop there. Nice mix of homemade beers from pilsner to stout. GF ordered a french onion soup that was delicious. Table ordered a white pizza with chicken and spinach which was decent. Customer service was excellent here. I joked with the server that for working at a place like this, her penance would be that she had to carry around the extra heavy menus. She agreed on commented how it was tough with 10 toppers. The mgr, Phil, saw I was wearing a Chicago Bears shirt and start making fun of it with another employee. Of course, I started jawing back and forth with him. He came over to the table and was very friendly. He comped a round of drinks and I asked him where I could buy some of their pint glasses (see photo, glass says on the 8th day man created beer). He came back with 4 glasses for our table on the house. Saved me the trouble of having to steal them. haha.  
 
If you can get past the place that this place used to be a church, you are in for a treat at this place. I would recommend it to all."
"PA","On a weekend trip to PA, we spent a day at Kennywood and then headed to Liberty Ave and the Church Brew Works. My sister and her boyfriend had taken my folks a while back and we had heard about this old Catholic church that had been converted into a brew pub and restaurant. So a day at the amusement park required a good, cold beer to close things out.  
 
Now the idea of drinking in a church seems somewhat sacrilegious to one who grew up evangelical Methodist. In my home church, you don't drink - or at least you don't admit to fellow parishioners that you enjoy what Ben Franklin called the ""nectar of the Gods."" So to walk into a holy cathedral to get our drink on was weird, but I was so glad we went. 
 
The church is huge. This place must give ""overhead"" a run for its money. It's a beautifully maintained church, with much of the decor intact. Pews for bench seating, the altar rail, lights, Windows, no crucifixes, Marys or Saints, thank God - perhaps that would be too much.  
 
The menu was a little foodsy-artsy, but not too expensive (for foodsy-artsy) and it was tasty. I had a turkey & brie sandwich that made me very happy.  I am not a beer connoisseur, so I can't really judge the beer, but I liked mine, Ian liked his, and my sister and Brad (Brad brews his own  award-winning beer) liked theirs, so I'd say that's great. 
 
Why not five stars? Well, I have to say we had the bar menu, which was reasonably priced for the food. The other side of the church was the ""restaurant."" I think if you charge much more for the same kind of food in this noisy of a place (old churches echo a lot), it would be a bit pricey for what you end up getting.  But for the bar menu and beer - a job well done!"
"PA","Church Brew Works is one of the reasons I moved to Pittsburgh! Well, not completely true, but it is one of the cool things about Pittsburgh for sure. Church is turning out to be a regular go-to place on Saturday or Sunday afternoons for me, with my wife and/or friends. That time of the day on the weekend it is usually pretty quiet (serene?). It can get extremely busy in the evenings, though. The beers are great, the food is better than you would expect (and in its own right very good), and service is usually good too. I'd say on the food front the pizzas are the best. And stick to the basics (e.g., pepperoni). I've tried their bison burger once and wasn't a fan, though kudos to the kitchen for putting out a medium rare burger that was actually medium rare (I find at a lot of places in Pittsburgh that if you order medium rare you get medium instead). 
 
Go to Church. Enjoy. Repeat."
"PA","I went to the Church Brew Works based on a recommendation from a native of the burgh.   It is a very unexpected and interesting setup.  If you didn't know you were going to a restaurant, you really don't find out until you walk into the 'church'.   I'm a thin crust - brick oven pizza junkie !!  If there is a brick oven in the house, I usually can't resist.  I ordered the Chicken & Chorizo Pizza  - Chicken breast, chorizo sausage, basil oil, plum tomatoes, minus the red onion and jack cheese.  Pizza was good, not great but good.  Next time I will probably try the Buffalo & Wild Mushroom Meatloaf.   I also had the basket of homemade chips and these would have been a whole lot better if they were served warm."
"PA","I took my wife there for our anniversary. We usually visit The Church Brew Works a couple times a year. The food and beer was always phenomenal every other time we visited. This time we went at about 4:00 PM on a Saturday. The restaurant was only about 2/3's full. The first thing we noticed was everything from the front doors, to the chandeliers, to the bathrooms, were very dusty, dirty and dingy. There were spider webs hanging from the ceiling in the dining room. We were almost afraid to eat there.   
    My wife's appetizer came out 10 minutes after mine and was over cooked. Our dinners were overall well below average for the price. Our favorite entrees were definitely not the same. The flavors were not what they were before and the portion size was too small. 
    The bar tender was drinking beer behind the bar which seemed very unprofessional. It seems like this restaurant is under new management and they have lost their good chefs. I think the owner needs to watch ""Bar Rescue"" on Spike, because this place is in trouble."
"PA","Love the Brewworks, especially their pizza, their pierogies and their watercress salad with salmon. Oh, and the beer. Thumbs up!! My only suggestion is that they improve the lighting in their courtyard to something more subtle. There's just too much glare at the moment."
"PA","I love beer, craft beer to be specific. When I visited Pittsburgh I had to make a visit for top notch craft beer. Unfortunately did not have enough time to visit Fat Heads during my visit, but Church Brew filled my need for craft beer. 
 
I loved the setting, some might think a church being converted into a brew house is wrong, but they really have done a nice job here. It is definitely a prettier setting for a brew house than I am used to. 
 
The waitress we had was really nice and suggested that we go with a sampler since we were trying various beers. This was a great idea and let us sample all the draft beers they serve. I enjoyed all the beer I sampled, some more than others, but they were all tasty. 
 
As a visitor to Pittsburgh unfortunately Church Brew Works is in what appears to be middle of nowhere, but it was well worth the cab fare."
"PA","My husband and I just love that place! We used to live in Pittsburgh. Now whenever we visit pittsburgh we have to go there! Great place, fantastic pizza and tasty beer!"
"PA","When visiting Pittsburgh with my boyfriend, our plan was to walk everywhere, but after hearing about this place, we were curious enough call a cab and head out there.  And it was totally worth it.   
 
For a business that is founded on an incredibly sacrilegious setup--a brewery in a church--the entire concept is carried out rather tastefully.  The church is highly preserved and still very beautiful.  Yes, you might be sitting on a pew while drinking your beer, but the waitresses aren't walking around in nuns' habits or anything cheesy like that.   
 
They offer a beer sampler that includes all their regular brews and seasonal taps.  There was a nice variety of dark to light beers.  None of them were out-of-this-world amazing, but all of them were quite good.   
 
Only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is the location.  You feel a bit out in the middle of nowhere, which isn't always ideal for a night of drinking.  However, I'd highly recommend this place otherwise."
"PA","I came to the church brew works not to enjoy their brews (sadly I am not quite the right age); however, I did get to chow down on some of their food. 
 
This place is real cool on the inside.  They didn't even strip out the pews; they turned them into booths.  It was real cool. 
 
First, we got a little (and when I say little, i mean little) appetizer of nontraditional pierogies.  They were buffalo chicken pierogies.  I think they were like $8 bucks or something, and there were only 4 little pierogies.  I mean they were delicious, but there were only four?  Kind of a rip off. 
 
For our meal we got the pizza.  It was also great.  We got the plum tomato pizza, and the cook even added our request of mushrooms on it.  My only suggestion is that they should let you get different sizes of the pizza because we wanted to try two different kinds of pizza, but we couldn't because the pizzas only came in the one large size.   
 
I would defiantly go back to this place to get another pizza.  I cannot wait until i am 21, so i can try their home brews."
"PA","Church Brew Works is just cool.  
 
I love these church converts into new and different uses. Takes a beautiful structure and breathes new life. Church Brew Works is a large, open hall of eating and drinking. And drinking many fine brews. I really love CBW beer, and often buy cases at local beer distributors.  
 
So aside from the interior awesomeness of the church, there is ample outdoor seating that is just lovely in the nicer weather. Atmosphere-check. 
 
The food is very good, but in my opinion a little pricy. The best deals are sandwiches or their wood fired pizzas. But still a couple things bother me. Like if you want sweet potato fries with your sandwich - its a $2 up-charge. But if you look at the prices on the side orders menu the price difference of regular fries to sweet potato fries is only $1.50. It just kinda makes it seem like they are trying to get more money from you than is justified by their own menu. Another example would be that the lunch serving and dinner serving of Jambalya are something like $8 in difference but the portion size does not change or is negligible. Just doesn't seem right.  
 
Aside from the pricing everything I have has there is very good. A lot of good drinking food...hearty, and very often interesting.  
 
Service is really good here. One time we had to wait before someone got to our table, and we were comped some drinks. I thought it was really good customer service, very appreciated.  
 
This is a good place for large groups, also a good place to bring visitors who might appreciate good local beer.  
 
Cheers!"
"PA","I love concept of a church being reused as a brewery. Beer isn't something to write home about, but I will be back to try their collection. The atmosphere is great. Although, we sat outside and the flies were annoying. Don't sit outside. The inside is where the atmosphere is anyways. Food was decent. I didn't get the pizza but heard it is good. Great place to take visitors."
"PA","OK - I love this place.  Not because the food is the greatest (although the cinco fromaggio pizza is wonderful, the buffalo and wild mushroom meatloaf is very good and the French onion soup might just be the best in the city), but because it is such a great atmosphere.  It is an absolutely beautiful space.  However, for religious patrons, it might feel a little sacrilegious.  But for drunken heathens like me, it's great fun.  I always take out of towners here because it is such a unique space.  The beer isn't bad either.  I love my agnostic mother's comment, the first time she walked in the place - ""This is beautiful.  They should do this with ALL of the churches!"""
"PA","I really like this place and am a frequent patron on my regular trips to Pittsburgh. The brews are fresh and the selection is awesome. The food is typically good pub-grub...nothing exotic but hearty and tasty. The decor maintains the beauty of this old church...terrific stained glass work. 
 
Probably an extra half star if the bartenders that worked here were a bit more interactive. The wait staff is pleasant and helpful but the folks behind the bar generally act as though they're doing you a favor drawing a cold one...what's up with that? The space can tend to 'echo' a bit but a nice place to spend an hour or two with friends."
"PA","I used to love CBW but in the past several years, they have become more pricey and the food quality has gone downhill. Their pizza is delicious and the beer is ok but not great. Their salads are generally very good too. Everything else I would say is about average for Pittsburgh.  The service there also tends to be slow.  All in all the atmosphere is cool but the food and service could probably use a little improvement. I would say it's still worth going on occasion for a pint and a pizza."
"PA","Lately I have been frequenting the Church Brew Works because of visitors coming into town and because my office really likes to order lunch from there.  
 
This is what I have found. Since I am in summer work out mode I tend to eat salads and protein a ton. What's better than a Buffalo Brgr! I get this as my lunch every so often. Juicy, lean, flavorful, bison, cooked medium well! No bun with a side of broccoli. It keeps me full, tastes wonderful and powers me up for a P90 workout!  
 
I also LOVE the Pulled pork sandwich and Cuban! I did like the pulled pork better when they served it on a pumpernickel raisin bun!  
 
So lets talk fire brick oven pizza! I like simplicity so the mozzarella, basil is my favorite! Pair that with the beer sampler and you have quite a nice Saturday afternoon couples outing!  
 
The last time I went to dine with my family we all ordered different items then shared everything! We had the shrimp carbonara, crispy vegetarian polenta, and the Buffalo and wild mushroom meatloaf. The carbonara was creamy and bacony, just as it should be. The meatloaf was super juicy and had a very good flavor, my dish the veggie polenta was tomato based and just ok, It is perfect option if you are vegan or watching calories!  
 
I just love bringing out of towners here, the majestic space and the ambiance, are unmatched. Be ready to become infused with a hoppy humidity! There is also a cute outdoor patio that is very inviting. Everyone in Pitt should frequent here!  
 
On a side note, I had ordered a pizza to go for my family the day we went since they had helped me move. It ended up being burned on the top so check your to go's! Management was extremely accommodating and hooked me up with a pie when I brought my friend for the sampler! Thanks Brew works!!"
"PA","Good food which is the most important factor, obviously. Creative menu- simple but with good variety. Also great atmosphere- who doesn't love unconventional uses for lovely churches? But the service was not great. Our waiter brought us the wrong wine, forgot our appetizers, and generally neglected us. Despite the service I would recommend it overall for the experience."
"PA","What a neat concept - a brewery and restaurant in an old church. Feels so wrong but yet so good. 
 
Not only the ambiance but the beer is why you should come. As for the food, it is mediocre and a bit bland so would suggest passing on a meal there. If you are looking for a quiet spot too this might not be the place for you as the noise does echo throughout the building."
"PA","My friend brought me here one night a few years ago.  Our get together here was the last night of my trip, so it has lasted in my mind as a memorable landmark.  At the time I was astonished to see such an interesting setting.  What an amazing place, reminiscent of steam-punk and religious vestibules.  There are organ pipes and pews and there is no place like it in Boston.  So by the end of my little night I was too tired to fight the allure that still today I yearn for.  Church Brew Works is on my must see list for the next trip I take to Pittsburgh."
"PA","This place had it all.  The ambiance was amazing, as it felt as if you were either in Germany at a beergarten or in a church about to go to Sunday Mass.  We chose the beer sampler and it was phenomenal with all the different flavors in front of you.  We chose the chicken wings for an appetizer along with the non traditional pirogues.  The wings were great, but the pirogues left something to be desired.  For the main course, I ordered the cheesesteak, which was one of the best I had ever had.  Overall I would love to go back to this place and try some new beers along with a different meal.  I would give this a 5 for the beer and a 4 for the food."
"PA","The Church Brew Works has a lot to like. The church architecture gives it a special ambiance. I used to live in the Czech Republic and CBW reminded me of some of the old buildings there which had been turned into restaurants and pubs.   
 
Their beers are good. Their hefeweizen and (currently) their coconut stout are exceptional. 
 
Everything else? Sort of underwhelms me. The food is pricey but the quality is sub-par. I've been there several times in the last year, and tried everything from the soups to the sandwiches to the pizza.  
 
Yesterday I had the lobster bisque, some of my friend's thai wings, and a slice of the mushroom pesto pizza. The bisque wasn't worth the $7 I paid for it. The wings were good, but not great. I thought the pizza was salty and rather bland tasting overall. 
 
I've had other pizzas that were better in the past (from the CBW), but again. They aren't anything spectacular.  
 
The service really varies. I've gone there during a weekday and had to wait forever. Other times, the waitstaff was spectacular.  
 
So in a nutshell: 
 
Positives: Good beer, nice environment.  
 
Negatives: Food quality and price."
"PA","How much fun is this place?!?  I'll tell you.  It's loads of fun.   
 
First things first: a big thank you to Pitt Yelper Kat M. for suggesting husband and I come here on our trip to the 'Burgh.  You were right, we loved Church Brew Works! 
 
If you're at all sensitive about your religious iconography, this might not be the place for you.  This former Catholic church -- St. John the Baptist -- was once a well attended congregation which slowly dwindled as the steel mills closed and residents moved out of the neighborhood.  Eventually the Diocese decided to close St. John's doors, sent a priest to desanctify the building, and put it up for sale.  In 1996, after three years of construction (during which the original building and fixtures, including floors, pews, and stained glass windows were carefully restored or preserved), Church Brew Works microbrewery and restaurant opened it doors.  While some of the former congregants are unhappy with this holy conversion, for the most part CBW has been quite well received not only in the neighborhood, but by Pittsburghers on the whole.  [We got all this helpful info from our excellent server -- good on CBW for educating its servers about the history of the church and brewery.  You *know* these questions come up often.] 
 
For two heathens like husband and me, downing tasty microbrews in a church pew overlooking beer tanks occupying a former altar is nothing short of a religious experience.  We enjoyed the Pious Monk Dunkel, Paganator Doppel Bock, Thunder Hop IPA, Millennium Trippel, and a special brew for their Caribbean-themed kick-off-to-summer celebration, Coconut Stout.  CBW makes some mighty fine brews.  Husband also had an order of their housemade pierogi.  The flavor of the day was alligator and plantain with a spicy mango sauce.  CBW is such a different place, the kind of spot you wish would open up in your own neighborhood.   
 
Our brewery, which art in Pittsburgh, hallowed be thy name.  Forever and ever.  Aaaaa-men."
"PA","I loved this place. I was just there last night and ordered something so genius. Perogie pizza. It was amazing! It took about 20-25 minutes but it was so worth the wait. If you like perogies you will probably love this pizza. Plus the atmosphere of the restaurant is awesome and different. It's a cool place to go that's unique and fun with all their beer selections!"
"PA","The beers were pretty good. The food was pretty good. Go for the atmosphere at least once. Very original idea for a restaurant."
"PA","In fide vivo Filii Dei, qui dilexit me, et tradidit semetipsum pro me. 
 
My real life is the faith I have in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me. 
(Galatians 2, 20) 
 
Yes, I had to look that up. I would check with the website before venturing over here, as they have funny hours of open/ closing depending on the day. We were there for Sunday lunch and had a great time. 
The food was great, everyone loved their brew and I got to revisit my Catholic school past. 
 
The ambiance is absolutely spectacular and the wait staff very attentive. 
 
Also, there is plenty of parking behind the Church, so don't sweat the street parking"
"PA","Four stars for the beer and the experience.  The brews were quite good -- I had the ThunderHop IPA and Pipe Organ Pale, and both fit nicely into the American tradition, with the Pipe Organ being slightly hoppier than expected, with a nice body and rounded flavor, and the ThunderHop approaching super-hop tendencies but not going over the top.   
 
The space is great for visiting with friends and family, as long as nobody will be offended by brewery equipment holding the place of honor on the altar. 
 
The food was solid but not a revelation, but it does just what it needs to, to not get in the way of the fun you're having enjoying beers in an old church.  I had a buffalo burger that was well-cooked without drying out at all, and the housemade chips were a great touch.  Our server was very friendly and helpful in navigating the menu and the takeout options (mmm, growlers). I don't know about the pricing, because my in-laws picked up the tab, which I'm sure also added to my enjoyment.   
 
If you like beer, or dining for the experience, this is definitely worth a visit while in the 'burgh."
"PA","Good beers, gorgeous surroundings, super cool idea (brewery in a church? Neat!), good food.  
There are 2 menus for dinner: the pub menu, for eating at the bar, and the fancier dinner menu. Two people before tip easily ran up a $100 bill with an appetizer, two entrees (nice steaks!) and 2 beers each. Worth it for a special night out (anniversary, etc.). The pub menu is also solid and has standard pub fare - sandwiches, fries. I look forward to eating here the next time I visit Pittsburgh!"
"PA","April 2011 Finally made it back to Pittsburgh and Church City Brew Works. It is still delicious. This time I had the chicken slaw melt and fries with beer cheese sauce. My friend had the watercress salad with shrimp, she loved the house dressing and was tempted to lick the little container. So it was that good. For dessert we had the coconut cake and raspberry ice cream. Turns out it was basically a coconut cupcake and ice cream. Still good just unexpected. It was also very spongy. Service was great and ambiance as fun as ever."
"PA","I'm waffling between giving this place 3 or 4 stars. Hell, it's a brewery in a church. Okay, its audacity earns it 4 stars. 
 
Someone told me that Church Brew Works is one of those places you must take out of town visitors. It took me two and a half years to see the place for myself, but I have to agree. It's beautiful with its stained glass windows and high ceilings, but it doesn't take itself too seriously. 
 
I enjoyed the two brews we tried, the Celestial Gold and the Pious Monk. The traditional pierogies we had as an appetizer were also great. The service was friendly and prompt, and our waiter saved our party of two from making a huge mistake and ordering a pizza AND another entree. Don't do this. One pizza for two people is plenty. It could probably feed three people just fine. 
 
Unfortunately, this place slips into 3-star territory with its pizza. We split the Southwestern, which had a chipotle-tomato sauce, corn, cheese, and red onion. Interesting flavor combo, but the pie should have been cooked longer. The center of the pie was also too thin, which meant that the tip of each slice always fell apart when I tried to pick the slice up and eat it. 
 
I'm not a churchgoer, but I'd visit this particular house of worship again for some beer and pierogies."
"PA","The environment was very untraditional since its a vacated church. The food options were a good reflection of what's popular in Pittsburgh. I ordered the Pot Pie, which was good. However, I wasn't particularly impressed with the food."
"PA","We were in town visiting family and they were really hyping this place in the days leading up to our visit.  Maybe they'd built it up waaaaay too much for us because although I wasn't disappointed by the food or beer, I wasn't driven to ecstasy like St Teresa of Avila.  The architecture of the place is the main draw here - it's a restaurant/brewery built in an old church and that's really the most fun part.  Once you're over that, it's a microbrewery & restaurant plain and simple.  The food was good - I ordered the pierogies because 'when in Pittsburgh...'; those were fine, but... I was focusing on my delicious Celestial Gold beer.  My wife had a pork-chop encrusted in chorizo which could've been interesting but was rather boring.  The entrees seemed expensive to me.  Maybe not though... maybe that's Pittsburgh prices or something.  The beers were pretty good - Knowing what I know, I would probably just skip the dinner next time and just come here for drinks and the pub-grub.  Did I mention the beer was really good?  It was really good. 
 
One minor annoyance was the extremely long wait for the check - there was probably something wrong with the register because even the waitress mentioned she was sorry for the long delay."
"PA","You walk up the stairs as if you are walking into Church on Sunday AM... and then all of a sudden.... BOOM it is a REAL LIFE Brewery in a CHURCH. 
 
We had to wait a long time for a table at the prime of weekend dining -- 8pm Saturday night. Whatever, that is normal. No stars deducted for the hour and half wait. 
 
The food was average, I was socked that they could get away with charging $15+ for dinner. I came for the atmosphere, not for the food. 
 
The beer was great... what I expected for a brewery.... Creative names, good selection. 
 
Great touristy place to visit. 
 
FYI this place was EMPTY by 11pm when we left... Come for a late dinner?"
"PA","Have been there before. Don't quite remember the cuisine, but this place you should try, to see how it feels to eat in a church."
"PA","Having waited nearly two years to try Church Brew Works, I was sorely disappointed by the food and beer, but overwhelmed by the atmosphere. There's really no comparing the atmosphere to anything else - it's in an old church, of course, and the high ceilings and stained glass windows are overwhelming. Unfortunately, my burger was subpar, and I've never really enjoyed any of CBW's beer - the fact that it was on tap from the brewery didn't help. Furthermore, my waiter was incredibly odd - lame jokes, and all, which detracted a bit from the experience."
"PA","I know a lot of people really love this place, but I can't stand it.  
 
I literally can't go there anymore because of the smell. I know it's because of the brewery and the yeast they use for the beer. But ugh....I can't shake it. I smell it when I come in, I smell it when I eat and I smell it on me after I leave.  
 
It's such a shame too because the place is just gorgeous! Obviously, it used to be a church and they've kept a lot of the original stain glass windows. Even the pews and tables you sit at are originally from the church.  
 
I.just.can't.take.the.smell.  
 
Also, I'm not really a fan of the beer they brew. I've tried it a bunch of times and it just never seems to stand out for me. The food is not bad either. I've had the pizza's, which are offered in a variety of different types. I seriously just can't take the smell.  
 
I'm sure I'll get talked into going again sometime, but hopefully it's in the summer when I can sit outside. The outside does have a great set up. Plus, you don't have the smell.  
 
I'm sure the point has come across the smell wasn't there I'd probably not mind the place. It doesn't bother my friends as much as it bothers me, so maybe I'll just chalk it up to having a strong sense of smell.  I'm totally ok with that when it's good smelling things, I swear!"
"PA","Great beer. Great food. Can be a little packed on weekends, but the wait is always worthwhile. Small outdoor seating area for the summer months is very quaint!"
"PA","Came here on 10-10-10, the Food Network was taping a show and we got free beer, appetizers, it was great. The food was excellent, the beers were all completely different. The ambiance is amazing and the staff was friendly."
"PA","Pierogi pizza. Need I say more? I love the overall ""comfort food"" feel of this place. The grandeur of the venue paired with just an incredibly filling menu will leave you feeling very, very full. 
Perfect for a large group, but try to make reservations, since it fills up on weekends. Beer flights allow you to try the different brews. And be sure to snap some photos on the BEER ALTER! No really, their stainless steel tanks of beer on the alter.
Truly a Pittsburgh institution, and a must for out-of-towners."
"PA","Beer is just ok as is the food, but the atmosphere is cool (which is the reason I go). I recently moved to Pittsburgh so my out of town friends who are visiting for the first time always want to go to Church Brew Works because it's so unique. I'll continue to bring people, but warn them that we're going for the cool pictures and tongue-in-cheek humor, not the cuisine."
"PA","The most religious experience I've had in a church in a long while.  My first pierogis -- excellent.  The IPA was great.  Loved the food.  This place is not to be missed!"
"PA","Ambience gets a star. The selection of food/drink gets a star. 
Appearance gets 1 1/2 star. Service gets half a star. 

prices - you lost a star. 

helpfulness? nope. especially if its packed. 

this place has lost its luster."
"PA","First visit to the Church Brew Works and can safely say it left a lot to be desired.  Had the Oktoberfest and the IPA and the schnitzel for dinner.  The beers were average, as was the main course.  The ambiance is phenomenal though."
"PA","First timer at The Church Brew Works, and I was disappointed to say the least.

To begin, the building is stunning! Absolutely beautiful! But for some reason, they felt the need to hang tacky, poorly designed flags everywhere which so cheapened the ambiance.

We ordered 3 different types of beer: the Octoberfest, the Oatmeal Stout, and the Brett Ambrosia. The beer menu is confusing and not helpful. The seasonal beers were not described at all, and some of the normal beers had ""if available"" after them. - note that I got the Octoberfest after being told their trippel was not on tap, and my dad chose the oatmeal stout after being told that they were out of the seasonal coconut bourbon stout. You are a brewery, & this is not okay in my book.

The beer was not terrible, but not fantastic. Nothing I would ever order again. The stout was not complex or full bodied at all. The Octoberfest was also fairly bland and forgettable, in my opinion. I'm not a fan of bretts, but you might like it if you are.

The service was terrible. The waitress seemed clueless and awkward. She answered with an ""I don't know,"" more than once with no offer to try to answer questions, had no idea items were unavailable until after we had ordered them, and was incredibly unprofessional. If she was new, I could've looked past this, but she made no mention of being a new hire.

Finalllyyy... The menus and food. The menus are awful. Very poorly designed and so confusing. The pages are falling out and the books are tattered. As far as I'm concerned, if you're charging $20+ for entrees like pasta, this is unacceptable. The choices on the menu had no rhyme or reason. Half were Italian and half were German, with a sprinkle of whatever else. 
The food was mediocre. We only got a few small things because it didn't seem worth the money, and the service had us wanting to run out the door. The spinach smoked Gouda dip was okay, but nothing incredibly memorable. The German potato salad was decent, and the soup was alright. Prices were way too high, in my opinion, for what they were serving, especially when they seemed to not be able to get much else right.

Overall, I was sad when leaving. This is such an incredible location with an amazing ambiance, but they killed it for me. Bad service, mediocre beer, and overpriced food made me not care if I ever came back. Wasted potential."
"PA","I came here with my lovely trainer who was super excited to be bringing me to a church turned brewery restaurant. And frankly, so was I! Apparently, they no longer allow churches to be sold with their interior decor so this place is truly one of a kind!

First off, this place is huge so you don't have to shy away from bringing large groups. They have a small lot behind the church so do consider carpooling. You are literally walking into a church and then walk into a large brewery instead. It is really fun! There is an earthy smell to the place that I liked (kinda like beets!) You can also see some of the cook stations like the pizza and oven dishes right up by the altar!

I tried their celestial gold beer and I highly recommend it for those who enjoy lighter beers.

Now to the food. I am not a German food eater and I was new to the cuisine sans dessert so be warned. I have been told German food is an acquired taste and can go wrong if you are not familiar with it. We started off with the perogies and I loved them! So soft and tasty. When we asked for an entree recommendation from our waitress, she said the buffalo pasta was one of her favorites. Loving the safety of chicken and pasta and buffalo sauce, I ordered it. The description said buffalo cream sauce with crumbled (blue/feta?) cheese on top. I am a sucker for creamy sauces. Well, I could not get through 4 bites of anything more than the pasta in this dish and I was trying really hard. The cream sauce appeared to be plain buffalo sauce that was congregating at the bottom of the paste discussing their very liquid form. The waitress was kind enough to exchange it for an appetizer of potato cakes and dessert. 

Potato cakes needed some seasoning. Their frozen peanut butter cake was perfect though.

Granted, I stayed away from their traditional plates. However, my trainer had the braised pork chop with sauerkraut and that wasn't appetizing either. 

The customer service experience here was great. Our waitress was attentive and we never had to waive her down for requests (this was before and after returning my dish by the way). The hostess was also super friendly and nice. The manager also came over to apologize. I really hate when I catch a managers attention since I am not at the restaurant to make a scene so it was nice for him to come by but definitely not necessary so kudos to their crew for that.

If you come here, expect great beer and a good time."
"PA","First, the good:  The atmosphere and decor is amazing, it is a huge, beautiful old church and is just such a fun space to visit.

Next the not-quite-so-good:  The beer is okay/average for local brewery swill, but  considerably overpriced.  We'd visit a lot more often and probably end up spending more overall if the beer prices weren't so outrageous.

And finally, the not-good:  The food.  Granted we only tried one item, but it was AWFUL.  We ordered their basket of ""homemade chips"" and they were disgusting - cold, soggy spiral-sliced potatoes that were stale (not crispy) and congealed with grease.  Inedible.   The bartender said that they ""make them fresh every day"" - ours had apparently been made in the morning and had sat around in their own cold grease all day.   We politely sent them back but the bartender didn't seem very happy about it and we spend the remainder of the visit wondering if we were going to have to argue with her about paying for them (as it turned out, we were not charged). 

Final thoughts: it's a cool bar, but the novelty has worn off for us. Mediocre beer at inflated prices and terrible food."
"PA","I don't know about what some of these other reviewers have had to say, but we went on a weekend at 4:00pm, there was no wait for either the dining area or bar seating area. Our waiter was nice, I don't believe he ever mentioned his name. 

I have got to say that the beer selections was on point, the food was delicious. I had the Cinco Formaggio Pizza which was excellent, the wife had the Cubano Sandwich which was very good. 

We will be back very soon!"
"PA","This place is definitely worth a visit just to have the experience of drinking beer in an old converted Catholic Church.  They brew the beer right up on the alter and the seats at the tables are made from the original pews!  As someone who grew up going to Catholic Church it was definitely a disconcerting experience at first to go into what looks like a Church to drink beer.  They brew their own beer and have several options you can try and you can get a sampler to try them all.  Their beer is good but not amazing.  The food is also good and they try to be really creative with things sometimes.  For example, last time I went I had rattlesnake and cactus pierogies which were on special!  That was my first time having rattlesnake and it was pretty tasty.  Their menu is a pretty eclectic assortment of things from Cajun to Italian (pizza, pasta) to traditional Pittsburgh items.  But it is a little on the pricey side for the quality of what you get.  Some of the portions are larger than others."
"PA","Forgive me Father, for I have sinned...I think. 

Well, I'm not sure where sampling beers on a Sunday afternoon at a micro-brew located in a former Catholic church necessarily fits in the whole scheme of things, but I felt I was violating some type of rule, code or commandment. Regardless, Church Brew Works had been at the top of my Pittsburgh to-do list since I heard about it last summer and I was checking it out, regardless.

Since I've never tried their beer before, I decided to order the sampler, consisting of eight different 5oz brews for $12.75. But after doing some quick math, I realized I needed to address my growling stomach first to avoid any unintentional purge-atory (rim shot). After looking through the variety of menu options, I decided on the lunch version of the Garden Plum Tomato brick-oven pizza. Aside from being crispy and tasty, it turned out to be the perfect size for one person.

Anyway, back to the beer. Sorry. There were four year-round samples consisting of Celestial Gold, Pious Monk Dunkle (+), Blast Furnace Stout (+) and Pipe Organ Pale Ale. There were also four seasonal brews consisting of Red Nebyllek, Coffee Dunkel (+), Thunder Hop and Oktoberfest (+). It was a great mix of all different types: light, dark and everything in between.

Regarding the interior, I love how they've kept the original structure, including the pews, fixtures and woodwork, mostly the same. Plus, you can walk up center aisle, which divides two separate dining areas, to the front of the church where large, copper brew tanks sit on the front altar. It's sort of weird, yet cool, to see.

Spending lunch here was a fun and pleasant experience and I was glad to see so many other people ""congregating"" here as well. Okay, okay, I'm done.

(+) = liked"
"PA","Solid joint.  Beer is better than expected and almost as good as advertised.  Food is up to par, but most everything revolves around the beer, as it should.  Everyone owes this place at least one visit.   Hope to be back."
"PA","Every Pittsburgh resident must go to Church Brew Works at least once. My husband and I have also enjoyed taking friends and family members to this unique establishment. At first, I wasn't sure what to think of a pub located within an old church. As a church-goer myself, I felt that I may be breaking some sort of 11th commandment by drinking there. However, I felt much better when I arrived. The restaurant has done an amazing job of maintaining the beauty of the church while creating an all new environment.

I've enjoyed all of the drinks that I've ordered here but particularly like the Cherry Quadzilla. One complaint would be that they always seem to be out of a beer listed on their permanent menu, which is very annoying. Someone in our group always seems to order an elusive beer which leads to frustration when it's unavailable.

Though a little overpriced, I've enjoyed the traditional pierogies ($6.50) and pizzas ($13-15.50). They are descent, but by no means items that I couldn't find somewhere else for less. I have never tried any of the entrees. Entrees range from $15-34, which all seem overpriced. Though the restaurant is cool, I don't think it's fine dining enough to charge more than $15-20 for entrees.

During my last visit in September, our food took nearly an hour to come out. Every second that we waited felt like a minute due to an unhappy baby being with us, but I did think the wait was a bit long for having just ordered appetizers and pizzas. Note to self -- don't dine there on the weekends if you want to be in and out within an hour.

Though I recommend visiting this restaurant at least once, it's excitement and novelty really lies purely within the location. Enjoy this restaurant with visitors, but don't expect it to become your go-to weekend spot."
"PA","For my money, this is the best place to have a beer in Pittsburgh.*  It's a desacramentalized** Catholic church that was shut down during a reorganization period in Pittsburgh's religious history, due to the overall shrinking of the population.  Beer has replaced the sacramental wine and the crucified savior has been replaced with a beer vessel for an altar, but the spiritual feeling remains and the irony of the term vessel is imbued...or I could just be getting a buzz.  Either way, this is an awesome atmosphere to have a drink with a bunch of friends.

And the beer...some is better than others. One of the IPAs was way too grassy-tasting, but I thought the Thunderhead was just about right.  The Belgian Trippel was refreshing, but it didn't have enough bite for me.  I had a sip of every beer they offered, and while none were bad at all, I wasn't blown away.  At the same time, the prices aren't bad, especially for a pint.  If the beer was better, this place would be five stars.  

* I didn't eat the food, so I'm totally unqualified to rate it
** I just wanted to use that word in a sentence"
"PA","Love this place. Very neat environment, good food (particularly the pizzas), and works for a romantic evening or a family dinner."
"PA","Given my penchant for sacrilege, this was right up my alley. Steel tank on the altar...yeah. We sat out on the patio cos it was a great day, and had their cask conditioned ale. Their food was pretty good. The french onion soup was fine and the buffalo meatloaf was very good, particularly the grilled vegetables. We also had the homemade potato chips which I really liked. A fun and funky place."
"PA","Really enjoyed this place -

Great atmosphere, the beer was good (tried two of the seasonals - Belgian black which i really enjoyed, and the absolution ale, which admittedly as someone i was with commented, had an olive-y taste)

Quesadilla i split with the GF was very good.

We stopped here to spend time before the reception of a wedding (having just come from a wedding).  

We had a really large group that kept growing and it was no problem at all."
"PA","This is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh, in part because their tongue in cheek approach to setting up the restaurant.  It is a brew pub inside of an old church.  The confessional is behind the bar and the brewing equipment is on the alter.  

However, the quality of the food is what brings me back.  Last time I went, I had the pulled pork.  Wow, the sandwich was huge and quite yummy!  I had a side of sweet potato fries, which were decent.  They have a pretty decent sized wine list and obviously a number of microbrews on tap.  

Our waitress was quite attentive, checking in with us regularly and providing refills of water without prompting.  It was quite busy but being a Saturday night, that was not surprising.  Expect to wait a little bit for a table.... you'll enjoy it once you do sit down!"
"PA","We were in town for a Pens game, and decided to come here afterward for some dinner. A friend of mine is a Carnegie Mellon grad, and suggested we hit this place while we were in town. 

As a recovering Catholic and beer lover, I LOVED everything about the venue. They left so much of the old church intact, from the holy water fonts to the stained glass to the light fixtures, and even used pews as the benches. The brewing equipment (well, some of it, anyway) was up in the altar area. Some people might see that as sacrilegious, but i thought it was fantastic.

I'll be honest, I wasn't thrilled with the trippel I ordered (it was a little too sweet and bubbly), but my friend's stout was really good. I brought a six pack of the dunkel home for my boyfriend, who is a brewer himself, and he likes it.

For dinner, my friend had the pot pie, which I tried and loved, and I had the crab cakes, which were also good. 

Definitely check this place out if you're in Pittsburgh!"
"PA","Came here during a business trip in Pittsburgh.  It's definitely a site to see, regardless of whether or not your a beer fan.  The old church building is cool and they have off street, free parking.  I went right after a business meeting so I made it there for happy hour.  I sat at the bar and had some spinach and artichoke dip, 2 slices of pizza and a sampler of their beers.  By far my favorite brew was the Tripple.  Nothing else really stood out.

They had another section for more formal dining.  I was wearing jeans and dressed casually but I didn't feel out of place in the bar.  The staff was not very friendly and the bartender spent more time talking to coworkers than helping people.  If I lived in Pittsburgh this is not a place that I would frequent, however if you're passing by it's something really unique that should not be missed."
"PA","Just OK is as much as I can say.

I don't actually drink, but I do know that this place has a good variety of beers, particularly microbrews that are either created on site or bought from an external source. I think the atmosphere of the restaurant is great for kicking back with a good group of friends over a beverage and maybe getting a bit of pretzel or salad, but that's as far as it goes for me, kids.

As a pizza fanatic, this place did not even blip on my radar of what I would call real pizza. Their pie has all of the markings of any overwrought craft in that the end result is not a celebration of the magical composition of perfect components in harmony. Instead, flavors are contorted, ingredients masked, and mediocrity served. Having grown up in a family that (in addition to pizza) also makes pierogis from scratch, I found their version very fair to midland--just passing. The problem I guess for me is that a regular potato pierogi should not give one heartburn, which I took as a sign of too much grease used in the cooking. 

Although the restaurant does provide a nice atmosphere to gather a group, I must add that the last time I met some friends there it smelled keenly of petting zoo. We figured that it must have been one of the grain ingredients for the beer, but it was STRONG. Try at your own risk. :)"
"PA","10 stars on atmosphere!  Sometimes the food can be a little off, seemingly more so at lunch time, but generally this is an excellent place to go.  Wonderful for those new to Pittsburgh, or to those entertaining those new to Pittsburgh.  This place is wheelchair accessible (husband uses a power chair), including the outside patio, although I'm not sure that the men's room is (haven't been in there and the ladies room is up some stairs I believe).

It really seems like the beer has gotten a lot better over the years too!"
"PA","Absolutely amazingly beautiful use of an old church. Beer is delicious and varied. My dinner was off-the-hook yummy. Great wait staff, great service! I love Pittsburgh and I'm glad this restaurant and brewery is here!"
"PA","Quick update. To be frank, this happened a little while ago. I was just so stunned I couldn't even write it up immediately.

A manager contacted us after we posted our Yelp review and offered us a gift certificate to entice us to give them a second chance (see my previous review for the whole story of how bad the experience was). Nice move! Restaurants should take note that this is the correct practice for ""service recovery"". Unfortunately, they botched their second chance.

The manager recognized us, even though we didn't mention we were there for service recovery. He apologized about our prior bad experience and thanked us for giving them another try. We did not see him again after that.

While we were in the middle of eating our appetizers, our server brought out the entrees again, saying ""I didn't want them to get cold""! That's the exact same thing that was the problem last time! Are you telling me that you know that we're in there explicitly to give you a second chance because of poor service on our prior visit, at your insistence, and then you go ahead and do the exact same thing that we complained about in the first place? That is the one thing they should have had figured out this time. Also, it's not like we're particularly slow eaters or anything.

They don't seem to understand: the food is going to die on the table just the same as it will die on the pass. The point of coursing a meal is so that we get the entrees at the right temperature when we're ready to eat them. If you don't want the entrees to die, don't fire them so soon. This is basic food service stuff, folks.

It's one thing to botch the coursing once. It's absolutely astonishing that they would do it again after explicitly asking us to give them a second chance for that exact problem. Wow."
"PA","After we heard there was a bar in a church, we had to check things out. We ordered a beer flight, 2 orders of pierogies, and French onion soup, based on other yelp recommendations.  Everything was delicious! The service was just okay. Our waitress didn't realized we were sitting in her section so we had to wait to order and she was generally slow throughout service. But this place is definitely worth checking out for the atmosphere as long as you don't think about the fact that you are drinking alcohol in a church, which is pretty sac relig."
"PA","It's not worth the wait. I don't know why people always say to go here. The food isn't very good (although I've heard the pizzas are decent and I haven't had one). Last time I was there it was later in the evening and there was a mouse running around our section. I think mice are cute, but not in a restaurant. There are better options out there."
"PA","Came here for beer and to taste the wood fired pizza. We were impressed seeing the wood stacks and what appeared to be a chef/cook picking fresh herbs, but then...... We asked for samples of beer which your only allowed (2) mmmmmmmmm they have (9) beers on draft but you can only sample (2) we tried a couple and not too impressed with any but settled in the pale ale and then ordered their take on a margherita pizza, it looked like a traditional oven cooked fast food pizza, but it actually tasted worse, so disappointed, looking over the menu it appeared this place has something amazing to offer but they did not. The dough was like eating cardboard, just awful, like frozen pizza that was burnt on your home broiler and then a week old!! This place has ambiance and everything in place to be amazing but someone needs to take control and make that happen. Ordered the Gouda Grits after sending the pizza back. They were chunky and some under cooked areas and made me think they were reheated. Not creamy at all. Flavor was ok tho. My friends ordered a pepperoni pizza. It was drowning in grease. Pic attached."
"PA","Cool atmosphere and decent local craft beer. I had the Cherry Wheat and the ThunderHop IPA which was my favorite out of the two. I hear there pizza is good, but I was traveling solo for business and was not up to the challenge of eating the entire 14"" pizza. 

One down side, there wifi connection was weak and went out several times over the two hours I was there."
"PA","This is such an awesome place to eat. It is in an old Roman Catholic church. The atmosphere is great, and the food is just as good! I ordered the brick oven pizza, and it was delicious. The beer is pretty good as well. On all the glasses, it says, ""And on the eighth day, man created beer."" I love it!"
"PA","Very cool idea repurposing the church building into a brewery. Went with a group of 5 and everyone liked their drink. Had the beer sample flight, which was fun. It allows you to try their more popular beers before deciding on one to commit to. People in my group liked it. I'm not a beer fan, so I had a mango sangria, which was tasty. They do have a good number of non-beer choices for those who aren't beer fans. We also got two pizzas that were pretty scrumptious. 

The good food/drink and the unique atmosphere make it somewhere worth checking out. I'm pretty sure this will be one of the places that I will be bringing friends visiting me in Pittsburgh."
"PA","Church Brew Works is a really cool bar/restaurant, and I dont think anyone can depute that. If you take friends and family here they will be impressed with the venue. 

The food for the price is a little underwhelming other than their Pizza's. They are pretty delicious for the price so I would shoot for that when going here. The beer is pretty good I am a fan of the Pious Monk Dunkle and a few of their other beers. 

Last time I was here the order time on the Pizza's were about 45 min - 1 hour so it took a while but I think they were just overly busy that night, so I think I can forgive them for that. The waitress was apologetic and nice so it wasn't a big deal. 

Overall I like church brew works. It's a super unique place with good Beer and Pizza. You have to give it a try at least once."
"PA","Good, more than decent lunch/sandwich bar food food, great beer.  But the atmosphere is absolutely 5 stars of wonderful.  The church is spectacular, and the patio is lovely too.  Seeing hops growing on the walls outside really makes a point.  This place does beer well.  And the site itself is just wonderful."
"PA","I was absolutely blown away when I walked in the door! I LOVE churches AND breweries...really, could it get any better than this?! NOPE! 

I tried their sampler beers and I was really impressed, Pittsburgh has some great local beers I must say. To eat I was reccommended the Pierogi Pizza, sounds like an odd combo but I was up for it. To my surprise I really liked it and would reccommend it for those of you reading this. I also had the 7 onion soup which was basically their version of french onion soup, still it was good. My aunt had the seasonal pumpkin soup-holy cow, its like pumpkin pie but soup-amazing!

As I am from Los Angeles, I really take a liking to novelty places like this as we dont really have them here. But if I was a local you'd probably find me frequenting this place. If I'm ever in the area again this will be the first stop I make."
"PA","Amazing place, amazing brews and good pizza too!"
"PA","Let me break this down for you...

Food: 4
Ambiance: 5
Beer: 2
Service: 3

I think I was the only person who really loved my meal, which made me sad. Our appetizers (pierogi of the day and risotto fritters) weren't that great so I wasn't expecting anything amazing from my dinner. I ordered the cranberry, turkey and brie sandwich. It did not disappoint! It's one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, but the fries were less than tasty.

Friends shared the southwest pizza and said it was so spicy it was inedible. Normally I would say it's too bad they ordered something spicy and it was too spicy, but the menu didn't even mention it being spicy or they wouldn't have ordered it! Other friend had the PGH style salad, about which she didn't have much to say and the boyfriend had the Cubano and said it was mediocre at best (surprising, as he loves Cubans and they're rarely bad).

The ambiance was awesome! I loved how evil it felt to eat in a one-time church that was used to brew and serve beer and spirits. It's really pretty inside, and has a nice feel.

The German-style beers I had were watery, too sweet or too lemony. Pretty disappointing considering since they're a brewery! Maybe I'm just too demanding, maybe I'm just like my father (couldn't help myself) when it comes to German-style beers.

Our server was so rushed that I felt badly for her. There should have been someone from management helping her with her tables. It was probably just an off night, but it was a little disappointing nonetheless.

If I lived in da Burgh, I'd probably come here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. I certainly won't make it a ""must eat"" place when I'm visiting."
"PA","Cool place! Great atmosphere. Good selection of craft brews!  What a great idea of putting a micro brewery in an old church."
"PA","Came here for lunch this past weekend. This is the best church on the planet. I enjoyed the Pittsburgh-y cuisine and beverages amidst an altar of beer. 

We wanted to try as many of the beers as possible, so we opted for the 8-flight beer sampler. There were a wide variety of brews in the flights. Some seemed a little off, but we generally liked most of them... I think I liked maybe 6 of the 8 samples.

Opinions on the food were mixed. The traditionally-prepared pierogies were tasty enough, but drenched in too much butter. The sweet potato fries were good, not great, and came with a spicy chipotle ketchup. My friend ordered the Cajun risotto fritters - I just had one bite, but I thought they were delicious. Others ordered pierogie pizza and didn't love it; I think they were expecting pierogies on top of the pizza, but as it turned out, the whole pizza was like a giant pierogie. 

The service didn't bother me, but I think some in our party were displeased. The kitchen screwed up a few things, and the food runner was pretty unhelpful (didn't mention that plates were really hot, claimed she ""just brings out the food"" when we had an issue, etc.).

But whatever. It's a brewery in a church. Thou shall not make minor complaints."
"PA","I have to hand it to the interior architects who designed the conversion of this old Catholic church into a restaurant.  It is a trippy, surealistic place.  The stained glass windows are intact and the hop vats (is that what they're called?) are up where the altar once was.  Yeah, there was a bit of sacrilige going on.  But that's fine with me.

I had a business lunch there and had a half southwestern chicken, hold the chipotle aioli, with a balsamic vinagerette salad.  It was tasty though not spectacular.  

Service was adequate but not particulary attentive.

I'm giving this a four star mainly because of the ambiance.  I've been in converted church establishments before (London, New York and Salinas CA) but all of those places removed much of the religious iconry.  Not Church Brew and Works.  For those who have an issue with this, I'm glad the place wasn't razed and replaced with condos.

Check this place out.  It's a trip."
"PA","Beer in Church - a bit sacrilegious and I'm not even a religious man....   J/K

That whole novelty wore off quickly....  Beer was decent - Food (had a philly steak) was plain BAD.   Better question is - how do you really screw up a steak sandwich?   Wife had a fish sandwich that I think had to be in their freezer since the day the place opened.   Hummus was actually decent and they served it with fresh flat-bread.  

Just another sub-par Pittsburgh restaurant.  

I will say that the Pizza that made its way past our table looked and smelled delicious - if i do go back, I would head straight for that! 

I would also say that the dinner menu was a bit on the $$$$ side for food that could not hold up to your better dining experiences.  Proceed with caution!"
"PA","This is a classic destination for out-of-towners and anyone who lives in Pittsburgh who needs to entertain guests, but it's worth a drive even if you're just having a local dinner. I love that they have a pierogie of the day, although I confess I've never tried those. They have a varied menu that's executed surprisingly well for a place with so much potential gimmick. The one bummer is the long wait on Friday and Saturday nights. If you show up without a reservation, don't be surprised if you have to wait 30 minutes or more to be seated, despite how cavernous this place looks.

The food is a bit expensive by Pittsburgh standards, I guess. Thankfully I'm now immune to that, as I earn my salary outside of western Pennsylvania... so I look forward to coming back and indulging at Church Brew Works =P"
"PA","I am going to  be honest! I find it extremely rude that they actually converted a huge pretty Church into a Brewery.When i visited this place the first time i felt horrible.I felt extremely guilty with the huge brewers placed where Jesus is supposed to be standing and the seats and a huge bar behind and all the chairs well arranged for dining!!

   My friends love this place for their good beer and they almost starved themselves to eat the pizza which they claim to be the best pizza ever.But i would also give them credit for being creative and  for having good food and drinks.Thus the 3 stars and -2 stars for being rude .HMPH.

   PS-I am not religious nor am i a Christian. Some thing's are just hard to digest.But kudos to your creativity!!! :)

-Smriti"
"PA","The novelty of  brew-pub in a church is definitely fun, but the food and beer isn't anything special.

The beers are your standard brew-pub selection - light ale, red, IPA, porter, and several seasonal choices.   It's possible you'll find something special, so try a few.

The entrees are a big disappointment - all are prepared ahead of time and just assembled for service.  It's cafeteria food served on nice plates.  They clearly stopped trying years ago.

The bar-food and hand tossed pizza looked more promising - I'd try that next time.

When they ask if you want the dinner or bar side of the aisle, choose the bar."
"PA","On our way back from Baltimore, we decided to stop in Pittsburgh for a day of sight seeing. One of the people that I was with heard about this restaurant so we decided to check it out. Upon entering, I seriously thought that we were in a church. The brewery in a church does seem like a funny punch line though.  I ended up having the salmon, which was great but not the best compared to some other places that I ate at on the east coast. The only drawback here was that I thought the entrees were a little too pricey. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would come here again, but only on a special occasion."
"PA","A gorgeous building and atmosphere provides a unique dining/drinking experience.

I had the Buffalo and Wild Mushroom meatloaf last night. Maybe the nature of the beast, but I found it quite dry and not my idea of what the consistency of meatloaf should be. Chocolate cake dessert was very good. I also had their self-brewed non-alcoholic Birch Beer which was good (kind of like root beer).

You would think that a church would be designed to maximize sound traversal, but somehow this church seems to deaden sound such that you can maintain local conversation even when busy."
"PA","There's nothing like having a brewski at church...

After going to Phipps Conservatory, we headed to Church Brew Works because I like the idea of drinking at church. This place was converted from a church to a brewhouse. I'm not sure what denomination it used to be. Inside, they put the vats of beer at the alter and the pews have been replaced by tables and a bar on the side.

We ordered a pitcher of Celestial Gold, a light malty beer and an artichoke, spinach and feta pizza to share. I thought the pizza was all right and the crust was very thin. All I know that they used a very large communion wafer. 

This place is a cool to check out if you are in Pittsburgh. I wouldn't mind back here again for the beer, but  will probably stay away from the pizza and try something on else on the menu."
"PA","As most people say, the decor is great. The beers are also very good, and don't forget to check for special brews. Unfortunately, the food is quite a step below the quality of the beer and the (amazing) surroundings. It's not that it's bad, just lackluster. Other folks have praised their fries, but I'm guessing they haven't been to Eleven, where the fries are amazing: actually hot, crisp and delicious - and I think they are cheaper too!

So, come, snap some photos, drink some beer then eat elsewhere."
"PA","You really can't do better than Church Brews.  Great food and beer with an atmosphere that is second to none."
"PA","This place is great. It is cool how they turned a church into a brew pub. The pom frites are awesome and the pizza is good."
"PA","loud, mediocre food"
"PA","The beer was decent, but the ambience was AWESOME! They turned a Historical Catholic Church into a brewery! It was super cool because it felt like you could be in mass one minute and drinking a beer the next. Must see!!!"
"PA","I took some out of town friends to Church Brew Works for dinner.  I would have given 5 stars, but we really wanted to order pizza but were informed that there was over an hour wait for pizza. So, I went with the Tuscan Cheesteak with fries instead.  It was pretty delicious.  I didn't know what beer to get, so I ordered the beer flight.  Definitely worth a try.  My out of town guests LOVED the place and raved about it for days afterward. Overall, I thought it was a great place."
"PA","This place was great!  Came here for lunch with a few people I work with.  I was immediately impressed with the place, the atmosphere was great.

All of the foods that our server talked about sounded great.  My co-workers ordered the pulled pork sandwich, the bison burger, and the pierogies, which were all met with rave reviews.  I hadn't been feeling all that great, so I wanted something a bit lighter and ordered the roasted beet and goat cheese salad, which was also fantastic.

I wish I could have ordered some of the beer, but I had to go to work a few hours after eating the lunch, and therefore was unable.  Next time I'm in PIT, that's exactly what I'll do though."
"PA","Heard about this place.  Punched it in on my Nuvi.  Cool lay out.   I love the way yet converted this church into a brew fest.  Great atmosphere but our waiter was absolutely no help picking a beer.  There goes his tip.....fun to visit.  Food was good but am little pricy.  Nice to visit.  I give it this place B+  cause of the waiter.  Must see place in Pitt."
"PA","Beer are good and the atmosphere is excellent, a must see as it's in an old church converted into restaurant & brewery. I was not impressed with the food. The French onion soup was too salty, although the fries were pretty good."
"PA","I will preface this review with the fact that Church Brew Works is where my boyfriend of 2 years and I had our first date so it will always hold a special significance for me, however, we have been back many times since and have enjoyed some delicious food and brews. I have enjoyed the mussels steamed with their pale ale-so good! My favorite item on their menu is the wild boar BBQ pizza (slow roasted pulled wild boar, Pious Monk Dunkel bbq sauce, red onion, corn, mozzarella and provolone cheese). I was skeptical at first having never had boar but this might be the best pizza I have eaten from a ""non-pizza centered"" restaurant. My favorite beer is the Hefeweizen. My second is the Pale Ale. My boyfriend's father actually went to church in this building as a child (yes it used to be a church for those of you that don't already know about the history of the building) so it is especially cool for us to come here and have that connection. Even if you don't want to eat, the buidling is so unique inside you should at least stop in for a brew or two and check out this old church!"
"PA","One of the neatest places I've ever been!  It's amazing how they transformed a church into a brewery/restaurant and still were able to keep the decor.  It is awesome in there.  Great food and the beer is awesome!  Good parking.  Good service!  Definitely a great place to eat in Pittsburgh!"
"PA","Just nothing that exciting. I'm not a beer person so this is mainly food related."
"PA","Great staff, nice selection of beer and great food! They also stock wine & liquor. Very cool atmosphere. An old church built in 1906, how can you go wrong? Seven of us were seated in no time without a reservation. They have a small store with shirts & Church stuff and they also sell mini-kegs & growlers to-go. I would definitely stop back on my next visit."
"PA","The beer is excellent.  More varieties than most small breweries and served at the exact right temperature.  I liked it so much I spent $20 bucks extra on two six packs to share with friends when my business trip ends.

The food is good, with some exotic ingredients that seem to try to justify $22 for pasta.  A little expensive even for a self-proclaimed food snob.

I don't like to write negative reviews because too many on Yelp expect to be overly pampered, but the Church Brew Works earned it.  Read on.

Be careful with the menus.  We received a dinner menu with $20+ entrees.  After seeing a wood-fired pizza oven in the corner, but no pizza on the menu, our waitress found another menu with food at less expensive prices (in the teens).  This menu included many creative varieties of pizzas on it, plus other interesting dishes not mentioned.  The moral is out-of-owners should ask for the BAR MENU  This isn't the Lunch Menu, Dinner Menu, or the Beer Menu.  Yes, they have four menus."
"PA","Good beers, equally good pizzas (the restaurant is also pretty nice, but the combination of well-made pizzas and beer is just a lot better). The main issue was to decide who would be driving back. :-)"
"PA","If all the churches are set up with a couple of beer brewing tanks, I bet you my friend would go to church every week.... 

Church Brew Works just look like a church from the outside. I definitely got fool by its exterior appearances. But when I was walking down the aisle, I know I have come to the right place!

I am always really into churches, love all these stained glass windows, the stone vaulted ceiling, and the Altar. 

Sitting at the benches sampling a beer flight of 8 ($12.75) and eating some Traditional Pierogies ($6.50) was definitely enjoyable experience. 

I definitely will be back for the beer, beer is definitely better than food?! 

Ample parking at the back of the Church, make sure you have a designated driver!"
"PA","+ unique setting, + great brews, + tasty pub food, - noisy

When Catholic Church sold one of their properties in Bloomfield they probably weren't aware that a real good micro-brewery would open its doors in their beautiful church. With the 'Church Brew Works' opening Pittsburgh gained not only a unique pub but also a great eatery.

I really encourage my followers to try their pierogi (Polish dumplings stuffed with potatoes and cream cheese or other fillings)! 
Besides, the variety of beers is impressive and overall great. I had the 'Pius Monk Dunkel', which wasn't strong at all but malty and light.

Inside it is quite noisy but you can escape the crowds by choosing a table outside in the former backyard.

+ unique setting
+ great brews
+ tasty pub food
- noisy

Average price for an entrée: $18"
"PA","One of the more interesting places I've ever eaten.  Was out of the way from downtown but well worth checking out just for the chance to hang out in an old world style church that was turned into a brewery.  

Good range of beers all made in house.  Try the cherry beer if you like your beers really strong.

Overall a really cool place but I had to take a star off because the pizza oven was broken, and I wanted to try the pizza there.  Ended up with bbq flavored pierogies which actually worked pretty well."
"PA","First and foremost one must recognize that this is a micro brew that serves food.  The food is good, but it is something you do while you drink beer so you don't drink too much, which you may because they really know what they are doing!  However, of all the micro brews or beer taverns in the area, they have the best food.

It is strange to drink and eat at the ""Church"" Brew Works because I am certain my grandmother took me to mass there as a child from time to time.  But I digress...

The beer and staff are great.  If one of the brew masters are there, which they usually are during the day, please ask them for some samples and suggestions.

If you go in the evening it can be a lot of fun.  The bar can be crowded, but the environment is always pleasant.  Sample many different brews and enjoy a nice bite to eat.  Be sure to take a growler home."
"PA","I went here for the first time very recently. The space is beautiful and noteworthy in and of itself, so go just for that. So neat. I got a fresh, light, lemony beer--exactly what I wanted on a hot summery Saturday. My burger was nothing special, it was definitely not awful, but I had a hard time remembering what I had gotten and I was there about 2 weeks ago. My nieces had the pierogis and they said they liked them, but they didn't look impressive or homemade to me. And the food is not cheap--you're paying high-end pub food prices. I probably will not return for food."
"PA","This is  a pretty sweet place.  When you walk in you kind of have this wtf moment and don't know what to think.  It's a church, but they're brewin' brews at the altar.  Kind of messed up, sort of.  Though, let's not lie, you know it's pretty cool.

The food that I had was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We had the feta cheese/spinach pizza which had a generous amount of vegetables and crust that was just a tad bit undercooked for my liking, but still decently tasty.  The appetizer (perogies) and desert (blueberry ice cream and chocolate mousse) were all excellent.  

I'm giving this place three stars, because while I think it's solid, I don't think it's all that it's cracked up to be.  The beer selection doesn't look all that extensive, though I suppose you'd like it if you're big into craft brews.  The food is somewhat pricey and from what I had, I could think of a few other places where I'd rather eat for the price I'm paying.  

Then again, I'm weird and this is just me.  This place is a Pittsburgh tradition, I suppose.  Try it out at least for the ambiance.  It certainly is interesting..."
"PA","What a cool place to eat and drink!  My Pittsburgh trip was guided by Yelp, and I ended up at an old Catholic church.... ready to drink a lot of beer.  This website really is useful.

We showed up right in the thick of the Friday dinner rush and had a 30 minute wait.  Our server was very friendly and told us all about the beer and food menus.  If you are feeling like a sandwich instead of an entree, be sure ask for the pub menu. 

I got the cuban sandwich, and my wife got the bbq sandwich.  Both were okay, but not great.  The beer was pretty much the same.  I got the hefeweizen (and later on a dunkel) and my wife got one of the beers on special.  Again, it was just okay.  Maybe it was just the night I went, but the beer wasn't that cold at all.  I know a little more than the average bear about beer, and that some beers are meant to be served at certain temperatures.... but it just seemed like it should have been served colder.  Again, maybe it's just me.... maybe I got there right as they tapped a new keg.  Maybe they poured my beer in a glass fresh out of the dishwasher.  I don't know.

The real appeal of this place is the structure housing it.  You sit there catching yourself looking up a lot of times during your meal.  I was struck wondering about the history of the place.  Not when it was built, or anything like that, but of all the weddings, baptisms and funerals had taken place here.  How many joyous and sad times.

So, to recap: Service - Very good, Food - OK, Beer - OK, Location - Great.

Recommend.  You gotta check it out at least once, but I'm not sure how often I would come here."
"PA","Yes, you've got cool decor and a cool building and you make your own beer, and it's good beer. But the (granted) one time I was there, and got a beer at the bar, the service mas miserable. The worst service I have ever gotten. We were met by a smarmy bartender who after pouring our beers proceeded to ignore my friend and I as we tried to flag him down to order another beer and then when this proved unsuccessful (a check had magically appeared in front of us) attempted for at least 15 minutes to flag him down so that we could pay and get the hell out of there. Not a fan. Probably won't be back anytime soon."
"PA","My friend's English department had a small get together here.  Pretty awkward setting of religion with drinking.  It sorta is strange but get over it.  They ripped out the pews but kept some of the chapel windows, etc.  It's not easy to find and my friend circled around until he actually found the church.  Not too well in marking the brewery and need better signage.  Food was average and beer was okay.  Go there for the weird factor and less on the food and drinks."
"PA","4 stars for the building: How cool is it to have a church for beer, with a big primary fermenter in the choir area?  (I didn't go over and check it out, but I think that's what it was.)  Only downside is that they did very little in the way of sound design, so you're surrounded by a constant roar with even a moderate crowd - not good for conversation.

2 stars for everything else:  Beer's really not that good.  It tastes like they're rushing it - the alcohol and sweetness taste like homebrew that I open too soon, before all the flavors have settled down and the more complex ones have developed.  It makes sense to do this as a small, maybe undercapitalized, brewer, because those tanks represent a couple of thousands of dollars of malt and hops.  Best to start getting a return on them ASAP instead of keeping them stored away for a couple of weeks to finish up.  (I've tried several, but their bottled stuff comes across the same way.)

Food is all over the place.  The $9 fish sandwich is a thin slab of freezer cod fried and served on a 12"" grocery store Italian loaf with no toppings at all, and I had to ask for an extra sauce cup of Tartar sauce to have enough for any semblance of flavor.  (This was the first time in a long while that I've left food on my plate.  Granted, it was a lot of bread, but I wasn't full: I just didn't want to swallow any more of the sandwich.)  Sweet potato fries were okay, but my friend's French onion soup was actually pretty good.

Service was par - nothing special, but no complaints.  Last upside is that they do take credit cards, which is, unfortunately, not a given in Pittsburgh."
"PA","Rightfully so, there is an extremely long wait for Church Brew Works during peak times.  The Saturday night we were there, it was a 2 hour wait.  

Make sure you stalk the bar patrons so you can snag a table in the bar area...those are first-come-first-serve!  The service at Church Brew Works is like any other bar...it varies with the server you get.

If you are a beer fan (and c'mon, who isn't) you gotta try one of their specialty brews.  The drinks were fantastic as well as the food.  All in all a fun experience!  

And I didn't even have to confess my sins (thank God; pun intended :-)."
"PA","I've been to lunch and dinner here and I quite like it .The setting is marvelous ,there is parking in the back and the beer is good if not outstanding.I like the food , in particular the pizza.I do suspect you need to show a little care when ordering because while I've always liked what I ordered here you could probably hit some loosers.Any way if you're in the wonderful and still underrated City of Pittsburgh,this is a must."
"PA","The atmosphere really is great and well worth the visit. It just feels so naughty drinking beer in a church but hey that's what makes it fun!  
The food to me is just okay  for the price BUT the beer is much better! Who needs food when you have a frothy glass of beer?"
"PA","I have so wanted to drag my boyfriend here for months.  After a trip to the Zoo, we ended up here for a very late lunch.  I work with a guy that raves about the place.  Of course, he likes to drink beer.

The setting is amazing.  You have to go to check that out at least once in your life.  You can spends hours trying to take it all in.  BJ reported his brew to be okay.  He had the Pittsburgh Pierogie Pizza with potato puree, sautéed onions, garlic and cheddar cheese.  He never leaves scraps, but did on this occasion.  So, I'm sure that's not saying a lot for the pizza.  I sampled it, it was tastey, but also very dry.  I opted for the Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich.  The pork was pretty much tasteless, and I failed to taste any BBQ sauce.  Also, the ciabatta bread was pretty tough.  My sweet potatoes fries were good and they should be since there was a $2 upcharge for the little suckers.  

Maybe we ordered the wrongs things.  Or maybe dinner is bettter.  All I can say, is once is enough for this girl."
"PA","Egads the beer is overdone and not consistent. That is of course a picky statement as I expect much more from a craft brewer. The atmosphere cannot be beat, though. This is a must to visit when you come to Pittsburgh."
"PA","What a unique dining experience!!! This place gets 4 stars without even factoring in the food. Add in the cuisine, and it becomes a favorite. 

In a city where the weather sucks ass half the year, its important for a place to have an inviting environment. Plus I'm a hardcore Cleveland Browns fan, and its always difficult to find a Pittsburgh location not completely saturated with Steeler shit and I.C. Light. Quite the turnoff!!! Its great to see that the Burgh has some class. 

I was only here one time, yet it left a lasting impression. The church is gorgeous. I really appreciate the European mentality: saving the old building and keeping originality while updating and transforming the facility during restoration. 

My friend and I split 2 wood fire pizzas. The Artichoke, Spinach, and Feta includes red onion, tomatoes, and parm as well. The Pittsburgh Pierogie blends potato puree, sauteed onions, garlic, and cheddar. Both pies had amazing flavor regardless of the fact that they used minimal amounts of each ingredient. The house brews were excellent too, as if that was ever a question! 

I despise the usual Pittsburgh atmosphere, but the Church Brew plays redeemer and keeps me excited for my next visit."
"PA","Menu has a good variety, appealing to many individuals.  Always curious what the Non Traditional Perogies are each time we are there.  Fun atmosphere; however, the meal/food service can be slow @ times."
"PA","Awesome decor, a must try for fans of Belgian beer and great food to go with it.
I bought a bottle of a Belgian quadruple cherry and washed down a very balanced shrimp and grits. Their pumpkin and chorizo risotto fritters and beer cheese soup were awesome. My girlfriend had a salmon burger with fried Brussels sprouts and sundried tomatoes - really really tasty and balanced.
Liked it so much, we grabbed lunch the next day on our way out of town. If I lived here, I'd be back every week. These folks have it all down from decor to beer to food."
"PA","Although it's been awhile since I've been here, I've visited a few times on various occasions in the past.  Needless to say, the atmosphere is definitely the most unique aspect of this place.  As others have mentioned, the place is a decommissioned Catholic church.  The seats are pews, and the brewing apparatus is located where the altar used to be.  For this reason alone, it's probably the most unique place in PGH to grab a drink.

Having said that, I've generally been underwhelmed by the quality of the food here.  Although I can't recall details because it's been awhile, it just hasn't wowed me, whereas I would expect it to be gastropub-quality, given the atmosphere and the price point.  Fortunately, every time I've gone, someone else has picked up the tab.  As for the drinks, you're pretty limited if you're not a beer drinker, like me.  They do have a few wines to choose from, but again, I haven't been blown away by any of them. At a microbrewery such as this, I understand that beer is the star of the show, and I expect to be limited in my drinking options, but I would at least hope that the munchies would be good.  Given the popularity of this place with out-of-towners due to its novelty, I'm sure I'll be back at some point, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, based on my experience."
"PA","Amazing food! Been here twice, and each time the eats and service were fantastic. The homemade chips are a tad greasy, but taste amazing! Follow that up with a nice entree (my favorite so far is the paella, though I enjoyed the jambalaya as well), and you'll have a great evening! CBW has some great desserts as well; the tiramisu in particular is to die for."
"PA","Food is just as good as it was a few years back, but service is just terrible. If you want slow service this is the place to go. Used to be a regular here but no more!"
"PA","Love their food, love their beer and the setting is worth it.  Get their appetizers and a few beers with friends, always worth it.  They are a little more pricey with their food, but we're not talking about just regular old bar food."
"PA","This place is awesome! Definitely a place to take out of town visitors due to the ""wow"" factor it has when you walk in the door. Love the stained glass windows, the beer garten quality it has to it. Just a unique place overall. Their waitstaff was attentive although a little clumsy when pouring water, but whatever. The only thing I really cared about is that they didin't spill my drink. I ended  up ordering their beer flight which will definitely leave you toasty. 

For my entree I ordered the Heirloom Tomato salad with I big honkin' piece of salmon, which was perfectly cooked. Their dressing was just perfect with this combination. My husband ordered their cheese pizza which was absolutely huge, so be prepared for left overs. Oh and for appetizers we had their peroguies which were pretty solid. 

I'll definetely be back!!"
"PA","oh my what  a terrible place. went wednesday night and was treated to the most god awful service imaginable by the cheesiest bartender. tossing a coaster to patrons and announcing ""prepare to be next."" alright, maybe add ""prepare to wait a while because i'm going to ignore you for ten minutes to take your drink order, then another 10 to get your beer, and a server is finally going to take pity on you and take your food order. the beer is just dreadful--again, the thunderhop, OK, but still not great. and the pizza needed more time in the oven, but even that took an hour! NOT RECOMMENDED."
"PA","THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! My kind of church. The food, the beer, the physical plant. I can truly say it was a religious experience. Repeat after me. Pumpkin Chorizo Fritters. OMG. Manna from Heaven. The beer is solid. A nice variety of styles. Pizza is top notch. I especially like the alter as brew-works. An old RC church, with the original stained glass windows and original pews as the booth seating."
"PA","As an out-of-towner the Brew Works had been recommended by several others as a place to check out while in Pittsburgh. I really like visiting breweries, and I love food and old buildings, so what's not to like? We stopped in just for a beer, as we had eaten earlier and didn't have a lot of time. The venue is breathtaking; it's worth it to come here just to enjoy the space and the stain glass windows. Definite plus that this old church was saved from demolition. I didn't order any food, but based on those around me it appeared that the prices might be a little high for what they offered. I had a stout, which was pretty good, and my partner had the doppelbock, which we agreed was just okay. There were no prices for the drinks on the menu (which drives me crazy) and the chalkboard menus behind the bar were too high to fully read. I think if we could have seen the IBUs on the menu for the doppelbock then it wouldn't have been our first choice, since we are not hopheads. They don't have many of their beers available in bottles or cans, so we settled on their Celestial Gold as a gift/souvenier for my parents. 

I'm definitely glad that I visited this place, and I think that it's worth the time if you're in the area. Now that I've seen it though, I don't have a huge desire to return. I think it would be neat if they played up the church atmosphere- some old choral music playing over the speakers instead of classic rock, but maybe that's just me. I will say this; it's great to see those brewing tanks up on the alter where they belong!"
"PA","After trekking from the Andy Warhol museum for four miles, the church of brew was a heavenly oasis. Unfortunately the beer was subpar but the atmosphere is like no other. Casks where the pipe organ was. Angels carrying steins of beer on a fresco.  the food was okay too, but nothing to write home about."
"PA","Great atmosphere.  Old church and high school (St. John the Batist) in the Bloomfield section of Pittsburgh, which now smells like a brewery.  Decent food and decent draft beer, but they were our of (real) IPA both times we visited.  They peddled something they called ""Belgian IPA,"" but it didn't have enough hops to taste.  They were out of their real IPA both on tap and in bottles both times we visited, about a week apart.   
The atmosphere, food, and beer are all better than average, and that's a strong triad.  They also have sweet potato fries.  Despite the deceptive (deficit) IPA availability, we still ended up going twice during a 2 week visit to the ""burgh.  MEL"
"PA","I'd like to comment on the food, unfortunately I was unable to actually eat here because apparently their pizza ovens have been down for a month or so.  Yes, there were other menu items, but I went specifically to try the pizzas and since they were not available, I spent my money elsewhere.  I may have eaten something else, but I was especially annoyed that we had to wait to be seated before being informed about the broken pizza oven.  Be warned: Call to make sure they actually have their full menu before you actually stop in."
"PA","Church Brew Works - proof that God is a beer drinker.

The food is good, but for me it's usually just something to munch on while I drink.  In other words, I don't really go there for the food.  I've never had a disappointing food item.  The pizza is out of this world and the appetizers and daily specials always have something interesting that catches my eye.  

While the food is good, the beer is better.  I find myself a fan of their seasonal offerings more than the signature brews which makes me sad because I keep having to find a new favorite.  Ask for samples if you're not sure.  But if you find something you really like that's a seasonal, get a growler before you leave.

My overall experience here is that the bartenders are better than the waiters.  In other words if there's only two of you, sit at the bar.  You'll likely get better service."
"PA","Have to say I must of been crazy not to visit this place sooner in my life.

Walked in the door and was just in awe of the atmosphere. Yes, it's just like its advertised...a Roman Catholic church turned restaurant/brewery. 

The food we had was adequate. No over portion sizes for Lunch here. Prices were good. 

A trip to a brewery without tasting beer is just unAmerican...so we had a few samples. The IPA was hoppy as expected with the bite in the aftertaste quite brisk. 
What I found even better was the Cherry Quadzilla, a special beer they make, not always on tap but today it was. Has such great flavor, goes down smooth, cherry/Carmel taste with just a hint of bite. 
Could drink it all day, however with the higher than most alcohol content, I don't recommend too much if you have to drive! 

All and all it was a great experience. The chocolate moose cake is good for an ending treat!! ( comes with 3 pieces of peanut brittle on the side). For me to say it was good means something because I don't even like chocolate cake!!

Will definitely be going back again in the near future!!"
"PA","The Church Brew Works has a fantastic atmosphere based on the idea of turning an old Catholic church into a brewery. The venue has a large area to seat its customers for dinner where the congregation previously sat in the church. They also have a bar located in the back left of the establishment.

Unlike our previous trips, we sampled their food menu as well as their beers. While dining, we sampled their Italian Perogies, gumbo, French onion soup, and buffalo steak. Everything was good and had good taste. However, not the best I had through my experiences.

The beer was fantastic. As an IPA lover I sampled the hoppiest beer they had in house and was happy with the brew.

In summary, this is a good microbrew and restaurant in an extremely creative atmosphere. Your dining experience here is more based on novelty than quality, but I'd surely recommend joining the ""congregation"" at this church!"
"PA","Setting - A
Service - A
Food - D"
"PA","The setting is truly breath taking. And by breath taking I was feeling unsure if I should drink or not. It felt bad but yet so good too! The food was okay. The beers were great, so many choices! They will let you sample before you decide to commit! I would go for happy hour and probably only order appetizers, I wasn't impressed with the food otherwise. 

It's such a cool atmosphere even though it's somewhat strange to be in a church drinking."
"PA","I don't get the attraction , This place has a cold not so friendly atmosphere. The food was ok , but kinda pricey. didn't look very clean or sanitary considering it was a CHURCH !

I'll just go back to Mario's in the south side."
"PA","Loved this place at first sight. Brewery built elegantly into the church. Come here for the view if nothing else. You've never been to a bar with such high ceilings and stained glass. The beer is great I think they had about 8 different kinds or so. Thunder Hop and Celestial Gold were great, there was a pretty good 9-percenter too.

The food isn't bad either. Way better than bar food. We just ate perigees and rissoto fritters but we weren't even hungry we just kept ordering food it was so good. Well I did anyway. Definitely a must see, even if you typically avoid churches."
"PA","Delicious pierogies, which are apparently a traditional Pittsburgher food.  At first I didn't quite believe that upon opening the doors I would find a brew pub here. I did, and it was amazing. I withheld an extra star only because the beer I had was ""just okay"" -- but, given my limited sample size this rating could easily be given 5 stars if there are more exceptional beers."
"PA","The atmosphere is great, and the beer was delightful. I got the Millennium Triple, which had the perfect amount of citrus. Next I had the Oktoberfest, which I'm pretty sure I could have drank many, many pints of, but I stopped myself after one. 

Now, to the food. The pierogies were a bit too greasy and not as flavor-filled as I've had them (we tried both the traditional and ""untraditional"" which on that day were bratwurst and sauerkraut filled). We also shared the risotto lollipops which were very nice (the sauce was the highlight) and the sweet potato fries which were nothing too spectacular. 

But oh, OHHH, the main course. I got the smoked pork chop with the beet BBQ sauce of the Oktoberfest menu, and it was memorable. The sweet sauce and the perfectly smoked chop were an amazing combination. The spaetzle and sauerkraut were exactly what the dish needed to balance out and the portions were very generous. 

Dessert we shared German chocolate cake, pumpkin bread pudding, and black forest cheese cake - all were wonderfully done. I really enjoyed the flavor of the bread pudding, very warm and homey, and the texture of the cheesecake was perfectly light thanks to the ricotta cheese. 

I wish I could give this 4.5 stars, because the appetizers were just an OK-start to what turned into a fabulously memorable meal in a fun atmosphere that I will suggest anyone passing through Pittsburgh check out. I'd gladly return (hopefully in the fall so I can get some more Oktoberfest brew...)"
"PA","Go for the ambiance and the beer. If this place had better food, it would earn that 5th star. don't get me wrong, the food is decent (especially the personal pizzas), but it's nothing special. 

What is special, like the other reviewers point out, is the venue. Set in a former church, the owners were wise in leaving the stained glass in place and in turning the alter into the location of a micro-brewery. And the brew is definitely worth it. They have a selection of staples that are all quite tasty and also rotate some seasonals in. I forget the one I tried, but it was delicious...and I'm not even a big beer drinking.

If you're swinging through Pittsburgh, give this place a try. It's pretty special."
"PA","Our meal with the Church Brew Works and Restaurant was a mixed bag.

Plus: My husband's beer was good

Minus: The in-restaurant brewed Birch Beer was watery and mediocre 

Plus: The ambiance was great and the building is beautiful

Minus: We had numerous flies around our table

Plus: The vegetarian options were delicious and the brick oven pizzas were great.

Minus: Our waitress was absentee and forgot our waters and my drink when bringing the rest of the tables' drinks. It just seemed like there were too few waiters for such a huge restaurant

Overall, the food and beer make it a great place to bring visiting beer fans, but they could make some minor adjustments to make it a place we'd like to go on a regular basis.

------------------------------------------------
Update as of 10/18/2009:

I'm increasing my rating by a star because of a followup visit. Our food was delicious, our guests were impressed with the decor, and our waitress was wonderful."
"PA","I came here during a business trip to Pittsburgh. I'll admit, it felt sacrilegious drinking beer in a church and moreover, a beer called ""unholy matrimony"" (one of the seasonal brews). The novelty of the place is that it still looks very much like a church inside, with the exception of brewing vats taking the place of the alter and a brick oven replacing the bishop's throne, etc.

The service from our waiter was excellent (comped us free soup because our food was taking longer than expected) and the hostess was very accommodating in trying to get us seated as quickly as possible (the place was packed).

Definitely try any of the brick oven pizzas. Our group of 8 ordered all of them and no one was disappointed. 

Bottom line: CBW has tasty in-house brews and excellent brick oven pizzas even the most pious of protestants will enjoy."
"PA","bless me, yelp, for i have sinned.  it has been far too long since my last confession...

i confess that i wasn't that impressed with church brew works.  oh how i wanted to love it.  i mean, it's a brewery. in a catholic church. their brilliant and creative adaptive reuse of the building should earn them at least four stars (and you thought i was going to make some comment about my jaded catholic upbringing and how awesome it is to throw down in a church) ;) 

so then, why the three stars? the service was less than... eh.   i listened to our waiter mumble out the description of the beers and specials like he was reading the sunday obituaries.  not a great start to the meal.  and the food was just... eh.  it's trying to be 'nice restaurant food', but all it is is glorified bar food at restaurant pricing.  and not necessarily good bar food at that.  

so given the lack luster review, why would i ever go back... 1) it's close to my house, so i can bike home sloshed if need be  2) the beers are pretty tasty (especially the pious monk dunkel and the millennium trippel 3) like the good catholic i was raised, everyone deserves a second chance and lastly, 4) the real reason... i can now tell my mom and grandma that i went to church this week without a guilty conscience"
"PA","One of our favorites.  

The beers here are some of the best around.  The Church itself is very cool.  

Get one of the Pizza's, I really like them.

Beware that the beers are on the strong side.  Might want to take a taxi of you plan on drinking a lot.

Service is usually adequate, not stellar.  Prices are in line with other places of similar type.

Parking lot a bit small."
"PA","Solely based on the quality of the food and service, I would have given CBW 3 stars; however, it's CBW and a Pittsburgh mainstay (and a great way to introduce family and friends to the city). While at times it's tough to hear your dinner mates because every word bounces and reverberates off of the insides of the church, you tend to forget this while you enjoy the general splendor of it all. I have at times had significant trouble with the service, however the food is pretty good and the beer is better than average- I give the place props for plopping a brewery right in the middle of the church. We call that sticking it to the Man. And I will continue to provide my support."
"PA","What an awesome setting-this used to be an old catholic church that got turned into a restaurant/pub. What an awesome and unique place. Anyway- My compadres weren't so impressed with the beer they ordered. I was! I go the Thunderhop IPA and it was very good and I'd recommend for anyone who likes a good IPA. We ordered a couple apps which were pretty good-spinach dip/chips and perogis. My friend and I then split the wild boar pizza. It was honestly one of the best pizza's I've ever had. All around awesome experience!"
"PA","The guy who hosted us knew about all the great places in Pittsburgh.  He took us here for lunch, and I could not have been happier!  The food was AMAZING!  I did not have any beer, so I can't comment on that.  The building is just beautiful.  Service was not anything to brag about, but everything else made up for it.  I had the potato pierogies with alfredo sauce - perfect choice, like big ravioli.  :)  I hope I'm able to find some place that serves perogies here in Columbus, Georgia.  I would really love to visit Pittsburgh again one day. 

Highly recommended."
"PA","Love the church brew works.....food is differnt and unique...went there with a group of freinds a few weeks ago - fantastic.....trufully not a beer drinker  - but my husband said the beer is amazing ...love this place"
"PA","Ate there a couple weeks ago- it was pretty fun for a large group. Cool atmosphere, lovely stained glass. Food was pretty good- just had a salad and the hummus appetizer. Everyone (8 people) liked his/her food. Brews were pretty good. 

I would've given a four star,  but it was pretty hot in there and did have a slightly skunky smell. Not just from the brewing- more like beer spilled on floor and mopped up with dirty water. Not really bad, but a subtle scent that you'll catch every now and then. I guess if you drink enough brews, then you probably won't care :)

Next time I would probably sit outside."
"PA","Whether it's a seasonal brew or my go to Celestial Gold, I always have a good beer.

The pizza is always phenomenal, I usually get the pesto pizza, but I've had numerous and they are all great!

To top it all off, the setting is just plain old awesome."
"PA","The best Lawrenceville has to offer!  Great pizza, fantastic alligator ravioli, eclectic menu each time we go.  The beer is awesome and the atmosphere, while somewhat irreverant in feeling (it still looks like a church) is very interesting and provides a lot of conversation.  The workers I've encountered have been very professional and pleasant.  Definitely a pure Pittsburgh experience!"
"PA","Good pizza! Awesome building!  So-So beer.

There are better microbrews by a long shot in Pittsburgh such as East End and Full Pint.   The Church Brew Works beer is average at best.

The pizza is great, the rest of the food is going to be solid as well.

Of course you go here for the fantastic building, and that part does not disappoint.

This is not going to be your regular haunt, but it's a great place to take an out of town visitor."
"PA","Very impressive menu. The gluten-free menu was actually enticing. The pumpkin risotto fritters was an amazing starter. The house-made chicken sausage patties were flavorful, and a perfect texture, and served with sweet potatoes and apples.  Husband greatly enjoyed the buffalo meatloaf. Beware however: although the house-made fries start out gluten free, THEY ARE NOT COOKED IN A DEDICATED FRYER. Depending on your sensitivity level, this could cause a reaction. Home made vanilla ice cream, with home made caramel sauce was a great end to the meal. Oh, yeah.........DH loved the beer flight, too."
"PA","I am a fan of this place, though it's not for the regular menu so much as the ""bar"" menu that they have.     I would say that their steak sandwich made with Kobe beef is one of the better (though not best) steak sandwiches I have had.    It is amplified even more when combined with one of their beers (more on that later).     

The second item I am a big fan of is the pulled pork sandwich, the sauce on this sandwich is house made using their Pios Monk Dunkel.   I just had this when I was here last week for the first time and I will definitely be back.  

Alright....so really the thing that puts this place up on the list....beer....in a converted Catholic Church.   I know it's a gimmick....but it works...and the beer is great, I have historically been a fan of their seasonal stouts, or if you are looking for a consistent beer always on the menu check out the Dunkel."
"PA","Pros: The food. The unique beer. The service. The atmosphere.

Cons: Nothing!

As a tourist to Pittsburgh, I simply had to check this place out. As soon as you walk in, the first word out of your mouth is ""Wow!"" They really did a great job restoring this church, and making it into a bar/restaurant. 

I went here once for dinner and once for lunch. I tried four different beers. All had their own special flavor. The chicken quesadillas have a very unique taste to them. They're definitely not your typical quesadillas. A bit of a kick to em.

This is the perfect place to go to if you're visiting!"
"PA","The food is mediocre, and the room is difficult to carry on a conversation in.  The building is neat."
"PA","The atmosphere and decor is amazing.  I tried a few of their beers and I recommend the Celestial Gold.  Their food was only average but eating and drinking inside a real former church makes up for that.  Service was also.out of this world.  I visited on a weekday afternoon for a late lunch and had no problems.  The only minor gripe is that its too dark and at the bar there is.no TV or anything.and you are stuck looking at their serving tanks."
"PA","An old Roman Catholic church turned into a brew pub/restaurant? Yes, please!

I love it!  The huge stained glass windows, pipe organ, beer!  It's pretty awesome to look at, and it has great food and beer.

Ok beer first.  I did the Celestial Gold.  It's a pilsner beer, that tastes like a lighter version of Magic Hat's #9.  So, yeah, pretty darn good!

For a starter I had the Cajun Risotto Fritters, chorizo, peppers, onions and cheese fried with a spicy sauce.  They were very good.  For my entree I had the Shinkasa Cheesesteak .  It was Kobe beef with peppers (no onions for me) and provolone.  The sandwich was perfect.  Delicious and not greasy.  Overall it was a great experience.  I will return next time I go to Pitt."
"PA","The Church Brew Works is one of those places where everyone has been and everyone raves about...but I just do not get it. I guess part of the reason I don't really dig it is because I'm more of a cocktail gal than a beer fan. Aside from the fact that it is a brewery and I'm not really a beer drinker, the food is only so-so. I got a perogie dish with chicken and my friend got salmon. Her salmon was ok and the same goes for my perogie dish. We shared some homemade chips with a beer/cheese dip before our meal. The chips were really good, but the same as any place that serves homemade chips, and the beer/cheese dip tasted like chicken broth. It lacked anything special. The atmosphere is awesome, and it would be such a cool place for a classic Pittsburgh rehearsal dinner or similar event...but the food is just ... eh. The atmosphere is the only redeeming quality that I can find. 

Also, our waitress was (I can't find a nice way to say this...I'm sorry) kind of annoying. She called us both ""Hun"" and ""Sweetheart"" the ENTIRE evening. It felt like those words are a verbal tic of hers...Every other word was Hun or Sweetheart. Her nails had been painted weeks ago...because there was a horrid spot of nearly gone green nail polish on every nail. It only takes a minute to remove nail polish, and when working in an industry that involves putting your hands in front of people it is worth either repainting them, or leaving them clean. The ""I painted my nails a month ago and haven't gotten around to repainting them or removing the polish"" look is NOT ok. Ok...I'm being mean. I'm sorry...but both my friend and I noticed her nails and her verbal tic, and we were both annoyed by both. 

All in all, it's somewhere that all Pittsburghers have to go at least once to see the awesome building, but don't have high expectations...it's just ok."
"PA","Probably better off skipping this place next time I visit but had to see the place bc a huge church turned brewery is a really cool concept.

A few of the beers here are ok.  The bartender initially was sort of a douche.  Either he confuses rudeness with having a personality or he was nearing the end of his shift and just DGF and it fails to reflect well on the establishment.  The girl that took over for him 20 minutes later was much more personable.

A couple of tasty beers here but fewer than other breweries in this town.  

What is really absurd is that the bar-keeps I talked to completely agree that the beers suck, but the place opts to serve the shit rather than dump it and just brew something better.  

Tried a beer sampler.  Four regular beers and four seasonals.  I liked the Celestial gold, and the Pipe Organ Pale Ale

The thunderstyle(i think that was the name?) IPA, some licorice mint concoction (sucked), the early summer brew ""confessional kolsch"" (again, i think that was the name) were not my cup of tea.  

Behind the bar was a mess.  Wet floors, a clusterfuck of tangled hoses, multiple Dish/glass racks stacks all over the place, wet floors, dusty display of glasses....just a general unsanitary/under-managed feel. That made me & my bro think things like the kitchen....which we cannot see....would only be worse off.  Eff-it, we wound up ordering a little food. Very little food.  Spinach-feta-gouda dip. That was pretty ok."
"PA","Beer made at the altar... Brilliant use of space!"
"PA","I like this place.  It is a go-to when we have out of town guests.  The beer is just okay, but the food has always been great.  The space is just fantastic though.  You can't go wrong with beer brewing at an alter!"
"PA","My prayers were answered - BEER! 


We arrived on a Saturday Afternoon for lunch and some beers.    I had read up on this place and was pretty amped to drink beer in a church.    I had read many good things about on Yelp.

I like this place but was not overwhelmed (more like undewhelmed :-( - I had high expectations)  There is nothing wrong with the establishment and i will go back.

They make their own beer in this big church.   I ordered quite a few and found the beers to be ""okay"".   My Pitt Native friend mentioned to me that his favorite beer was not currently available so I will need to revisit and rewrite my review.

Food - We ordered a couple of small pizzas.   The first pizza we tried was the Pirogie pizza.   It was pretty much flavorless (pizza, no sauce, with mash potato dumpings, covered with cheese)...   I had higher expectations.   The second pizza was pretty good.  Please note in Pittsburgh - there are some good pubs that serve great pizza - this is not one of those pubs.

All and all - nothing was bad but nothing was great.    I will be back and try some more items and rewrite my review."
"PA","Have been attending the church whenever I've been in the burgh for the last 9 years or so. The Church is always fabulous! From the spiritual guidance of my pastor behind the bar to the typically wonderful rotating brews to the menu hands down the best place in the burgh."
"PA","it's the typical looking church but with big beer tanks on the alter.  i was unaware of the outside seating so we made our way to the bar area and grabbed a bar table.  the service was a little slow and it was dead in here for a friday night.  we grubbed on a pepperoni pizza and some beer.  neither were amazing and the place was a little pricey for a pittsburgh joint.  it's worth a stop in to just check it out.  will it be a favorite of mine for years to come?  naaaaaaaa."
"PA","I travel for work a fair bit. In some cities it's easy to find tasty, unique (non-chain) places to eat; others not so much. So, when my colleague said, ""I heard about a brew pub in an old church,"" my response was, ""Say no more--I am SO there.""

It did not disappoint.

Was it mind-blowingly delicious food? No, but it was tasty and enjoyable as far as road food goes. 
Was it the most amazing beer I've ever had? I don't know--I'm not exactly a beer snob.
Was it a great place to kick back some beers with a colleague and a business partner? Definitely.

Sure beat eating in the hotel restaurant, or a mega-chain which is guaranteed to be uninspired and uninspiring fare.

As we left, I noticed they have a veggie patch out back. It's too early in the season for me to benefit from that garden, but I'm sure it makes its way to the table later in the summer, and that earns them an extra star in my book."
"PA","I am a Catholic and had no problem walking into this place!  Um, that is until I walked down the aisle and began to get that eerie feeling...like I was at a wake or something.  To be honest, it felt weird but I enjoyed myself.  The inside of the church was awesome...especially the tank setup at the altar and to the left of the aisle.

I went to Church Brew Werks over the winter and do not remember what I ordered for dinner, but I do remember what I ordered to drink - STOUT!  I had two of them and my co-worker had the sampler along with some pale ale, I believe.  I remember the beer being outstanding.  So much so, I took a growler back to the hotel and put it into my luggage to bring back home with me..."
"PA","This restaurant is in an old Catholic church which gives it a great atmosphere. The menu is full of great comfort foods. They offered pizza with pierogi toppings which I didn't order and it still haunts me to this day that I didn't get it. It's like my white whale......damn you church brew!"
"PA","It's cool that they brew their own beers. I wasn't a huge fan of the food and beer, but it is a neat restaurant in Pittsburgh!"
"PA","i was brought up catholic, so it almost seemed sacrilegious for me to be guzzling  beer in a former spiritual sanctuary.

however, i thought the beer was good (the hef was my fave) and the interior is impressive. definitely worth the experience."
"PA","They brew the beer on the altar -- enough said! 

Seriously though, this is a cool restaurant with tons of indoor seating in addition to a nice outdoor courtyard. The food I've had here has been good and they have a nice selection of beer. Definitely worth trying if you've never had dinner in an old church! Try the pizzas -- they're excellent."
"PA","I enjoy beer.  Real beer.  Not the watered-down megabrews that so many people somehow enjoy.  I've currently had only 6 of Church Brew Works beers, but they've so far been very underwhelming.  I will keep trying in the hopes that I can find a winner and bump up the star rating.

On that note, I don't think I'll ever be back for the food.  My table of 7 started with a pizza...and probably should have stopped there.  One friend got a steak hoagie that was basically salt-crusted, another got jambalaya that was oversalted and inedible, my girlfriend got a sandwich that was average at best, I got an overcooked buffalo burger...you get the idea.  And it's definitely not cheap; for Pittsburgh it's more on the expensive side.  

If you go, ask someone what the best beer on tap is, give it a go, and get a pizza.  Skip the regular menu."
"PA","Had a great afternoon meal at The Church Brew Works yesterday. On a previous trip to Pittsburgh we had tried to eat there but found not a single spare seat and did nothing more than peek in the door. This time we arrived around 2pm on Saturday and there were plenty of seats available. I won't speak to the coolness of the actual space as I'm sure many others before me have done a great job. Only thing I will say is how cavernous it is but yet you feel cozy - the low lighting helps lend itself to that mood as do the bright stained glass windows.

We started with the pierogi's of course (un-traditional). These were a mix of kielbasa, potato, and onion on the inside and on the top a mustard and horseradish sauce. Wish I had ordered more because they were gone way to quickly! I ordered the lunch size (9"") Portabello Pesto pizza and Dave ordered the Artichoke, Spinach, and Feta pizza. We both preferred the Portabello by far but both were yummy. Andy had a Char-Grilled Buffalo burger with spiced fries and said he enjoyed it. 

Dave and Andy ordered the Pipe Organ Pale Ale and the Celestial Gold. Consensus was for the Celestial Gold. Andy also ordered a bottle of Quadzilla - a Belgian Style Cherry Wheat and I found it similar to Lambic (one of two kinds of 'beer' which I do drink) and very tasty.

Overall - I would recommend it to friends/family and hope to go again.

PS - I think it's funny that there were 33 votes for Alcohol: None in the survey :-P"
"PA","The most outstanding thing about this place is the feel.  When it first opened, it was too well lit, and had antiseptic tables.  Since then it has begun to capitalize more on its clerical provenance--dimming the lights and making it a bit mysterious.  This is very much a fun/interesting place to eat.  I think that the food is decent, and the beer very reasonable in quality.  Ultimately though people come here for the overall experience.  We had some friends from Chicago come here to visit who were very Catholic, they had a great time eating there (although they felt like they needed to go to a confessional)."
"PA","Its a brewery inside a freak'n church...it looks and feels really cool inside, pulling up your thinking, not they didn't, but, uh, yes they did. 

The beer is not the greatest but still pretty good, it's worth checking out if your in the city."
"PA","I love Church Brew Works and come here often. They have some great brews and some not so great brews, but they have something for everyone. Their best brews (in my opinion) are the Belgian Tripel, the Mole Stout, the Coconut Stout, and the Dunkel. 

I've only eaten off of the bar menu, but I find the food to be consistently good. The pizzas are especially excellent. 

The service is sometimes spotty, but the servers are doing the best they can and are good about communicating about delays. There is one bartender who is kind of a jerk.

The ambiance is great. It's a stunning location that was the neighborhood's Catholic church for years. The stained glass windows are especially great. For those of you complaining about the smell - it's a brewery! That's what it smells like when they are brewing. 

My only complaint is that they sometimes close early at night depending on the crowd.

The takeaway growlers are a great value."
"PA","I am a fan, of the architecture and ambience of this building, and the stone oven pizzas.
I'm not a fan of their average beer, food prices, mediocre service. 
It's a great place to bring in out-of-towners. To me it's a seen it, liked it, move on."
"PA","I always want to love it here.  While CBW had *ahem* an excellent brewer for a period of time, I regularly stopped for a beer or lunch while walking to the Strip for summer grocery shopping.

That said, the food is great, the ambiance is great, and the beer is back to mediocre-at-best again.  It still is a fun place to take out-of-towners for dinner, but take them somewhere else for beer."
"PA","Great food, wonderful beer in the best room in the city....not to be missed.

Make it a point to get the bread pudding for dessert...and get it with the cinnamon ice cream, you'll thank me."
"PA","Atmosphere is crazy awesome..
Feels like a church when u walk in... Beer is good nothing crazy.. Service is up and down ... But still don't miss this place"
"PA","Church Brew Works is an amazing brewery situated in a former church that has great pizza, great food, and  great beer."
"PA","The ambiance is perfect... The concept is amazing... However the downside is the not-so-spectacular fusion of flavors in the food. I ordered the buffalo meatloaf which tasted bland and the side vegetables tasted weird and overcooked. The wild boar pizza had no extra kick and isn't extraordinary. The sandwhiches such as yinkasa cheese stake was surprisingly excellent. All in all we had fun dining in this place but perhaps attention to more diligent food flavors is called for."
"PA","This Place is awesome! They have Great beer and amazing food!  A must go to place in Pittsburgh!"
"PA","The concept is cool. A Brewery in a church. the architecture and environment are definitely there, but it is lacking on really the two defining factors of a brew pub -- the food and the beer. The beer is fine but nothing to write home about. The food is not great and service is slow. Overall it is worth a visit to experience it, but I dont think it is a place I will be frequenting often."
"PA","I gave Church Brew Works a star for the novelty of having a brewery in a church and a star for their pizzas. Besides that I haven't been too impressed with their food and beer.
It's a cool place to take someone whos from out of town, but don't go expecting a culinary experience."
"PA","Awesome pizza.  The beer is more bitter and if that's how you like it this is great.  I'm more a blue moon type so not really my taste.  Otherwise it was interesting to see a church turn into a brewery.  Have to check it out."
"PA","Best mussel sauce ever! Dunkel beer, garlic, butter and mustard! Pretty great! No pic! Was hungry!"
"PA","Personally, I love the Church Brew Works Happy Hour!  Half price appetizers with the exception of a few items and great brew prices. Their small beers are 12 oz, regular 16 oz, happy hour beers are 14 oz.  So normally a thunder hop IPA that goes for $4.21-12oz or $5.61-16 oz is only $3.74-14oz.  They have pizza by the slice for around $1.50.  I also have had dinner there numerous times; it's all very good.  Great restaurant, really cool place."
"PA","The location of the Church Brew Works is amazing but it's very loud.  The beers are great but the food is kinda meh.  If I go back, I would go only for beers and appetizers."
"PA","Inconsistant. I've been a few times and have had some great meals and some really poor meals served cold. The pierogies are pretty good though a bit expensive for what you get, the sandwiches are good and good portions, the entrees are all a bit higher priced for what you get.

One thing that's been great every time I have gone has been the beers, decent selection of great craft beers."
"PA","Church Brew Works has an interesting ambiance in the setting of an old converted Church.  The beers are quite good - the Celestial Gold is their classic.  Food is slightly overpriced for what it is, but I suppose the cost is in the overhead of such a surreal environment.  It's a good place for happy hour, but doesn't quite meet the mark to be a true dining destination in its own right."
"PA","If you have never eaten here, you should go just to see the inside of this old church turned brewery (unless you think that kind of thing is a sin). The place is amazingly beautiful. Even the bathrooms are pretty. The beers are great, some are a little too hoppy for me, but most people like that kind of thing. The pizzas are also great. Most of the entrees I have had could have been better. I would stick to beer and pizza or pierogies here."
"PA","I am an out of towner and we heard this place is all the rage. And it is!!! The beer selection was extensive (if you like IPAs, this place is for you). I was impressed by the waiter's knowledge of each beer. My other half got the beer sampler, an excellent way to try a little bit of everything. As far as food goes, everything I tried was delicious. My favorite was my entree - potato and cheese pierogi with garlic sauce (I also opted for the addition of pancetta). I couldn't finish it all, but I so wanted to! I was stuffed. If we visit again, I will probably be trying the pizza from their bar menu. Last thing - how cool to turn an old church into a brewery!? Thumbs up for originality!"
"PA","Church Brew Works is a Pittsburgh tradition.  Its the prototypical place that you take your family when they come to town and want to personally view the sacrilege of multiple beer vats sitting on an re purposed church altar.  

Thus the blessing and the burden of Church Brew Works: Its a great place that embodies Pittsburgh through and through.  Beer!  Wings!  Pizza!  Salad with French Fries!!!  Traditional Perogies!!!  Overpriced and over rated non traditional perogies like turkey dinner and bacon!!!  But its also notoriously crowded on weekends with customers from out of town asking if they are pronouncing ""yinz"" correctly and trying to insert ""n'at"" into conversation.

If you can beat the crowds to get a seat, I highly recommend the pizza and the Pittsburgh salad.  The rest of the menu is pretty hit or miss.  The quality of things like wings, sandwiches most appetizers vary wildly based on how busy the restaurant is on the given night.  Service is unremarkable but good.  Prices are a little steep, especially for the drinks."
"PA","We loved it! Plum tomato pizza was great. Larger than we expected. About 10 slices. Turkey and brie sandwich was also very good. Get the beer sampler and try out a whole buncha different brews. Overall, prices are pretty reasonable too and this old church is super cool inside! Great, great stuff! We will definitely be back."
"PA","The atmosphere and decent brews make this place worth a visit.  It just looks great, and the beers, while not the best, are good and inventive. Mint-milk stout? Not my favorite, but I love the attempt. 

Beer prices are decent too.  I'd recommend coming in here and grabbing a drink or two at the bar.  There is one TV, but this is a more relaxed, family and/or dinner atmosphere.

The food is hit or miss.  The 7 onion soup is awesome, but at $4.50 a cup, it better be.  The pizza are pretty good, made in a wood fired oven.  The crust comes out doughy, but not too thick.  I had the chicken and chorizo pizza, it came out with huge chunks of chicken breast and a tiny dusting of the smallest pieces of chorizo I've ever seen.  The service was really slow all around here; took a while to get both drinks and food.  Far too long considering it wasn't even crowded when I visited.

Bottom Line: It's a cool place that warrants a visit. There are some good beers, but expect slow service."
"PA","Q: How do you get this guy into a church? A: Serve beer and ensure that there will be no pedophile priests. Zing?

Beer replaces holy water. Meat replaces that one Jesus guy's body. Bartenders and servers replace alter boys. Brewing equipment replaces the alter. Tipsiness replaces enlightenment. I have more.

Walking in, I could not help but feel like I was in the presence of something holy. By holy, I mean holy shit, beer. We had a flight of seven 5 oz beers, most of which were pretty goddamn good. Although CBW's beer is nothing to necessarily start a religious holy-war over, I can't complain. Their rauchbier, Belgian IPA, and Belgian tripel were good enough for me to want to drink them post-resurrection. Their mint stout was a bit of a miss, but I cannot judge them for their sins. Call me a heretic if you must. But dear lord, the bison delmonico, tenderloin medalions, seared sesame tuna with cabbage, and bananas foster bread pudding made me want to convert to eat here all the time, but alas, I do not live anywhere near this fine establishment, nor state. Oh, and our waiter was great. By the end of the meal I felt like he was the Joseph to my Jesus.

If ever you immaculately conceive the idea to get some beers and require the body of a dead animal in your stomach, go to Church. Halleluiah. Jesus serves."
"PA","Big fan of the Church.  Their non traditional pierogies are almost always a great choice, paired with the pizza and their beer brewed on site, this is a must stop when in the Bloomfield area of Pittsburgh."
"PA","The atmosphere is excellent in this old church.  Service has been good both times I have been here.  Food is very good, sandwiches and burger both stand out.  Beer is good as well.  Not a big selection like other breweries, but what is on offer is usually very good."
"PA","Ben Frankin was misquoted as saying something along the lines of ""Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy..."" Well, it turns out he was talking about rain, and it's effect on grapes, and how wine is proof that we are loved... but that is all beside the point. 
Three things I am ""In to""-- Ben Franklin, beer, and churches. 
I loved the atmosphere here, and would take the time soak it all in again if I had the chance. The whole theme really had me at hello. I've seen the whole revival of an old church space into something of a place of drunken debauchery done before, it's pretty popular in trendy European neighborhoods, but the Church Brew Works has toned it down a notch to make it accessible and enjoyable without being cheesy. I think Ben Franklin would have approved. 
The brew selections were nice, and along with what I sampled, I thought I got a fair deal for what I paid.  
The thing that made this a three star was (and I hate to say it) was the service. Our bartender had an easy job. We were two thirsty people on a Thursday late afternoon, but still, she seemed unenthused at helping us quench our thirst. We made it work, but without even cracking so much as a smile, or offering any suggestions or sharing any history of the place, she slid our drinks across the counter only after we flagged her down. I am hoping that she's had better days before and since. 
My conclusion is, I'll be back. Next time for food, and anticipating some better service."
"PA","I just visited the Church Brew Works for the first time over the holidays after passing it many times in the city and being intrigued with the beautiful building.  

The interior definitely did not disappoint!  The sanctuary is gorgeous, with stained glass windows, gothic architecture, and old pews scattered throughout.

I would say the ambiance and beer were 4 stars and the food was probably a 3.5.  (I tried their holiday beer, which was a dark french beer and was quite tasty.)  The appetizer selection was extensive and I really enjoyed the smoked gouda/feta/spinach dip.  This place is also known for their pizzas, so I'd recommend skipping the rest of the entrees and just going for that.  I got their famous pierogie pizza, which was good, but needed an extra kick...like onions or olives, perhaps.

Overall, it's worth the experience and if you need a place for a large group, I'd recommend it!"
"PA","This place is awesome!"
"PA","Congratulations, Church Brew Works, for making it on to the opening scene of the movie 'Zack and Miri'. You looked great in that shot, as usual - beautiful and confident. You do the city of Pittsburgh proud.

As for my 3 star rating, I just don't think this is the place to go for good food. For a cool place to drink and chill with your friends, this location is okay. And, of course great for tourists and returning ex-locals. But, it's definitely not somewhere I'd go regularly to grab a bite and gulp. If you do need to order something, I'd recommend the pierogies. 

Church Brew Works is like the movie star that doesn't have to impress on things that matter (like food) because they have the looks and fame already."
"PA","meh...........as a native Pittsburgher, I think this place is trendy and overpriced.  I'd rather go to Penn Brewery at the bottom of Troy Hill."
"PA","I was in Pittsburgh for work and one of the local guys suggested we try the Church Brew.  I'm not very familiar with Pittsburgh, but this place was somewhat out of the way.  It didn't have many interesting things around it.  Basically it's a bar/brewery built into an old abandoned church.

The place has been restored and is truly beautiful inside, with gorgeous stained glass windows, church pews, alter, and of course dining tables.  

We sat down and I watched as 4 of the waitstaff walked by without acknowledging out existence.  It turns out one of the waitstaff that ignored us, was our waiter.  Eventually he stopped by and took our drink order.  I ordered the Mexican Mole Stout, which was pretty good.  As the name suggests, it is a stout with mole spices.  I like stouts and love spicy food, so this was a must try.  As I said, it was good, but far from refreshing, so I suggest a glass of water with it.  

After some time, our waiter again decided he should stop by and take a food order.  We both ordered the Shinkasa Cheese Steak because I was after all in PA...not Philly, but PA nonetheless.  When it finally arrived the sandwich was very good, but overpriced at $11 for it's size.  The fries portion was also small, but they were not that great anyway.

We waited again for the bill after completing our meals.  I would have actually ordered another beer because I wanted to try another of their varieties, but our waiter never returned.  My review gets 3 stars mostly based on the very cool setting of a brewery being in a church and the Mexican Mole Stout being tasty.  However the food is overpriced and the service was poor.  Cool place to try once, but I wouldn't consider this a ""must see""."
"PA","came here on a trip and i found this place on yelp. it sounded like a fun place to try. The food was average, i actually found myself liking the buffalo meatloaf more than the kobe beef i ordered. i got the beer sampler, and they were out of a few of the beers. it was fun, and loud which i actually liked."
"PA","Pros: 
1. The brewery is located in a gorgeous church. I mean, it is really really pretty. The novelty of eating & drinking in a church is pretty great. 

2. The brews served up are so delicious they could make a monk cry. If you love a good local brewery with a consistently good reputation, church brew works is a shining star. Fortunately, the brews are bottled & you can buy them around town in cases & six packs. I have drank multiple sampler cases of all their various ales, ipas, ambers and stouts, and loved every single one of them - that's saying a lot. I can be particularly hateful about subpar beer. 

Cons; 
1. The wait staff appears to be trained in assholism, to a degree that I have often been discouraged from going here. Too many times I have left swearing never to return for the abuse & neglect. Once I sprained my ankle here on some slippery stairs. Instead of offering me an apology and a bag of ice, as a decent person might, or offering a number of their lawyer in the event of a personal injury liability claim, the waiter was a complete dick & tried to up-sell me on an expensive bourbon shot, ""for the pain."" 

2. Some of the food is mediocre, but none of it is a good value. I am a person who loves garlic, but you have to wonder why you can't taste any other flavors in so many of their dishes. The food is overpriced without a quality to back the price tag. They have a tempting ""pierogie of the day"" dish -- don't fall for it, it is disgusting 99% of the time. If you have to eat here, try one of the pizzas. Vegetarians have limited choices here. Vegans will starve. 

3. Church Brew Works brings in people who would otherwise never venture to Lawrenceville, and gives them a totally mistaken impression of the neighborhood. This is not a place where you befriend folks at the next table. The majority of people here are not like you. And you should be happy you are not like them. 



Despite all this, it is a really really pretty church! Good place to impress parents & in-laws from out of town. Office ladies who live in the suburbs will eat this up. Your wait staff is likely to deserve less than a 10% tip, but if you are like me, you will be guilted into leaving at least 15% because the universal good tip karma requires that you pay it forward."
"PA","1. Awesome, awesome concept. Loved how the alter showcased the brewing 
2. Variety of award winning beers to choose from - definitely wished we ordered a flight instead.
3. Mussels for that day was absolutely delicious. I couldve easily ordered and finish two more plates.
4. Yinz cheese steak was pretty good, never had one with coleslaw and fries inside but a great compliment to the meat
5. Beer buffalo wings were delicious, not soggy with sauce or too dry.
6. Seats were old school pews"
"PA","I wish I could post separate reviews for the beers and the experience. The beer is great. It's fresh. Based on the quality, I presume CBW is a craft brew pub. There is an interesting selection of rotating beers. I will definitely attempt to acquire more CBW beer in the future; unfortunately, I don't think it will be at this venue.

To start, it took about 10 minutes to get the attention of one of the bartenders. That's just too long especially when everyone is ordering just beer. Also, the bartender brought us the wrong beers. We ordered the belgian tripels, and he be brought us american barleywines. I should have noticed from the color and said something immediately, but I decided to give it a shot with the likely chance that I was wrong. Upon tasting, my suspicion was confirmed; however, I really enjoyed the style, so I didn't ask the bartender to correct it. I'm glad I tried something new, yet it shouldn't have happened this way.

The atmosphere is very similar to Hofbrauhaus'. It's very loud with a eclectic clientele; similar to Hofbrauhaus, there are many family casually dining. one big difference is that no one is dancing on their seat. I would also assert that folks here appear to be less drunk which I'd attribute to the smaller serving glasses. Also, there didn't seem to be a beer garden."
"PA","Very cool ambiance! And tasty beer. No pee on toilet seats. What else matters?"
"PA","The food is okay but the beers and ambiance are the focal point. CONS: It is incredibly loud; and, food takes too long to come out. PROS: The beer is fresh and tasty; and, the church itself is gorgeous."
"PA","First of all these guys are like the pioneers of the Pittsburgh craft beer movement.   Cool concept, good beer, and decent food.  I remember coming here last time I was in the 'Burgh 5 or 6 years ago and I feel like I had a much higher opinion of it that time around.  Not that there was anything wrong this go round I just feel like the gastro pub scene has really stepped up its game in the past few years and these guys have remained pretty much the same.  Worth a visit if your in town for a few days, if for nothing else than the photo op of the fermentation vessels in the alter!"
"PA","Let's just say this... you're drinking beer in a church.  Doesn't get much better than that.  The Onion Soup was great as well as the Wild Boar BBQ Pizza.  Can't beat the prices either."
"PA","This place has legit beer and good food.  The atmosphere is a little noisy, but it's a fun place that I'll definitely re-visit!"
"PA","The ambience is awesome, but I thought the food and beer were really lacking.

We had the rattlesnake (the special) and potato and cheese pierogies.  The crust was  thick and chewy--not my favorite pierogie crust.  The fillings weren't great either.  The rattlesnake was similar to chicken in taste and blandness.  The potato was lackluster as well...I've had way better potato pierogies from the grocery store.

My husband tried the beer sampler, and while he found the beers pretty agreeable, I couldn't find a single one that pleased my taste buds.  I normally like wheat and slightly fruity beers, so that could be why...take my beer opinion with a grain of salt.

My entree was the mussels, which were cooked in beer.  Sadly I didn't enjoy those because the beer they were cooked in had a bitter/hoppy taste...meh.  My friend's pizza was pretty tasty, so I think pizza is the way to go for food here.

It was an interesting place to check out while I was in town, but with average food, service and pricing, I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."
"PA","Beautiful and full of beer.  I ordered fried Brussel Sprouts.  People are friendly.  Oh yeah... It's in a church."
"PA","This place is mayhem on a Saturday night.

We somehow managed to wrestle a tall, four-person bar table right upon arrival so the killer waits and crowd didn't affect us much. There is the waiting list for the restaurant side (right), and the free-for-all that is the bar (left) side. Every man for himself, regardless of how you slice it.

We had the pierogis and 'Belgian' fries to open, and split two pizzas amongst the four of us. The peirogis were excellent; the fries were just fries with a dish of aioli - i guess aioli makes them Belgian. One pizza (pierogi again) was solid, the other struggled with flavor - so much so that I can't even remember what was on it. The crust on that one was also undercooked, with the edges burnt (oven temp issue?). We also had two flights of the beer sampler, and those were excellent. I was checking out non-pizza items all around us and can safely say that the food is probably not great across the board - it looks like a lot of straight up, low-end bar food. That's not horrible, but just advice for the eating side of the world. It's a pretty cool place if you don't mind crowds and noise. Certainly worth a visit."
"PA","We have gone twice.  The first time we actually got a table after waiting almost an hour.  The food was OK as long as you stick to burgers and pizza.  The beer was pretty good though.  The cons were the service.  Once we actually got sat, the wait staff was very inattentive.  The second time we went we were told that they don't accept reservations on weekend nights.  We couldn't even sit at the bar it was that crowded.  And they told us an hour and a half wait.  For decent beer and OK food, totally not worth it."
"PA","I was back here over the holidays and I feel like I really needed to update this review to distinguish my previous rating about the food and the beer. First off, once again I tried several of their beers. Their rotating stout was a chocolate-mint and I found the mint flavor absolutely undesirable. I also tried a seasonal brown and was thoroughly disappointed. However, they did have a bottle-only IPA (the Thunderhop) that was drinkable. But once again, I would rate the beer  2 or 3 stars.

However, the food was absolutely phenomenal. We started with the hummus (good) and the spinach, feta, and smoked Gouda dip (phenomenal). Then for my lunch, I had, literally, the best French onion soup of my life. For anyone that makes it to the Church Brew Works I cannot say enough that you MUST TRY THE FRENCH ONION SOUP.  I also tried the nontraditional pierogies, which, were a green chile, cheddar and chorizo. These too were excellent.

So overall, the beer is a bust but the atmosphere and food make this place worth of a rating bump."
"PA","About the only way I would step into a church.......to have another drink and eat at the Chruch Brew Works!

If you are in the Pittsburgh area you definitely have to check out the Church Brew Works. It is a beautiful restaurant. It is a redesigned church and they still use parts of the pews and kept some of the decorations. The best part is they replaced the alter with the brewery! 

The food and beer was very good. I had the very large Cuban sandwich and it was one of the better cubans I have had outside of Key West. My friends had the bison burger which received rave reviews as well. Since it was a brewery I had to have the sampler. I was impressed with most of the beers. If all you like is commercial crap beer like Miller Lite or Budweiser, don't bother. Many of the beers are strong flavored. My personal favorite was the Chocolate Mint Stoudt. 

The waiter was bad, and a bit arrogant, but the food was good enough that he did not ruin the score. 

If church served beer and food like this every Sunday, I would have to find Jebus!"
"PA","Great craft brews.
Outstanding food.
A tad too noisy during prime time, but not enough to dock points.

Tourist trap? Far from it. Places like this (and D's) make me wish I lived in Pittsburgh."
"PA","Before Reading please note my review is mainly based on the service and food, as I did not try beer. I did try their wine and I was pleased with bottle pricing and taste so if you are just looking to make a pit stop for a drink consider this a 3 star review. If youa re looking to eat pass this place up. A couple of basic issues first there is little to no parking neighborhood or in the lot in the back if you are going on a weekend night so plan ahead. This is ok I can deal with it if I love the place, second I was supposed to be seated with a large group but my friend and I would have been split up due to the pew seating. This was ok it was our fault for being late. We chose to sit in the bar instead of wait for our own table. So we get in the bar and service at a table was super slow we get our wine within 10-20 minutes of sitting which is fine but I think the food took 55 minutes for two sandwiches. The food was just bleh not high on taste after that wait and the hype I have heard I was hoping for more. But it is just another chain resaurant hiding inside a church (let down). I got the philly cheesesteak sandwich my friend the crab cake because we were hoping for something quick and filling. Cheese steak was just ok bun was too big and lack of  generic cheese sauce made it dry, no sauteed onions or peppers ( again let down.) My friend had the crabcake sandwich and they had not put any sauce on it. The waitress did bring her a tiny bit of sauce as it was supposed to come with sauce. Here is the kicker the sweet potato fries we both paid  $2.00 extra on top of our 15$ sandwiches for are from Sam's club! Hahahaha I have to laugh because if you're going to serve me precooked fries which I am sure a lot of places do don't charge me extra and at least try to make sure they are wedges or something. Throw a cajun spice rub on but don't barely heat them they were super cold.... and buy them at Sam's club. If you're one of hte most hyped breweries in pgh! People notice these things lol. At least it provided me with a good laugh. So all in all 4 stars for atmosphere yea its a cool place young attractive crowd, but I am a food lover 1-2 stars for food, 3 stars for drinks. Part of town is tricky to maneuver at night. I would pass and try another brewery in town because food and beer are lovely when done properly together and maybe church brew works needs to build a better kitchen."
"PA","This was the most hyped place of the trip i went on and it did not deliver. All of the beer they had was pretty bad. The mint chocolate chip stout was horrible, no one could finish there sampler of it. There perogies were meh but there pizza was pretty damn good. 

Service was horrible. The bartender was an ass and our server said maybe 2 words to us. And there was an hour wait at the door and a hour wait for the pizza once we ordered. And of course they wouldnt seperate our order. 

This place it a tourist trap. Stay away."
"PA","I have eaten here about 5 times, over the course of 7 years or so.

I love the concept, design, and atmosphere of this place. I love that they've re-purposed a ""de-commissioned"" church. I love the beers they make. Their staff, also, have consistently been great.

My issue is with the food prices. I cannot believe the outrageous prices they charge for the food, considering the type of food it is (mostly high-carb, basic comfort food and bar food) and the quality of it (just OK). Seems very mismatched, considering the quality and the genre of food. But, maybe you will disagree with me-- see if you can check for their menu and prices online before you go, if you are concerned about spending carefully (many people are, these days).

Definitely give this place a try-- the experience of being there is great, it makes for a unique evening (although noise is a problem for conversationalists, on nights when they happen to be crowded) and if you enjoy beer, those are certainly worth tasting. But if you're watching your money, consider eating at home before going here, and just going for drinks or for something small to eat and seeing friends. The food is not the draw, here-- at least it definitely was not the draw for me. In my world, bar food should be priced like bar food."
"PA","The only reason worth going here is to ogle the scenery. It's a one-off tourist event, and I don't discourage out-of-towners to visit because everyone loves to drink beer in a fabulous church. However, this is not a place for locals. The food is snooty and over-priced. Head over to the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern if you want some good pierogies. 

The beer here isn't bad but you have to suffer through the insufferable waitstaff to drink it. Head to Penn Brewery for a good Pittsburgh brewery. 

Overall, walk in, look around, get a beer at the bar if you must, and take off for greener pastures."
"PA","i have to say, this must've been the most interesting renovation project when it was conceived.  i would've loved to have that as a design challenge.  

our experience was low key as we were here rather early (6pm-ish) before the crowds.  we were seated in one of the ""pews"" in the nave with a central view of the apse, whose altar worships brew kettles.  along the left side of the aisle is the bar area, and i think the transcept areas had additional seating.  

the beer was really affordable...had to be the lame-ass pittsburgh tourist and order traditional pierogies, which at first sight and bite seemed heavy and tasteless but actually grew on me.  the hummus dish was a bit much with the bread a bit over baked.  the food was excellent, and i would definitely go back with friends if i lived there.

faster service and exceptional food would've brought it to 5 stars."
"PA","They play on the fact this place used to be a church. You can drink in the pews and there are beer kettles on the alter. It even has that old church smell. Their beer and food are good. The location is a little off the beaten path, but it's worth the trip for the experience."
"PA","i realise that going to a brewery and not having beer is rather tragic, but there you have it.  however, the food and service here are great.  the wood-burning oven produces delicious pizzas, and the pulled-pork sandwich was pretty good too.  the best thing, however, about Church is just that -- it's in an old historic church.  the use of the former sanctuary space as a sprawling restaurant and brewery space is innovative at the very least, and rather brilliant at best (having the tanks in the former apse/ambulatory (i.e. the front) is quite visually entertaining).  the ambiance is definitely unique and makes this a worthwhile dining experience.  

(be prepared for a potential wait on weekend nights; reservations are only accepted for parties of 8 or more.)"
"PA","Located in a beautiful old church my eyes always have to adjust going inside to the dark interior.  When they do though, I am not disappointed.  The vast church has been carefully turned into a great restaurant and bar.  The staff is friendly, the food is good and beer is cold.

The reason to check out Church Brew Works, aside from the great pizza, is the beer.  This micro-brew has the tanks on the alter and a wonderful selection of local brews.  Also, it is a steal to take home a growler filled for only $7 for 4 pints.

Definitively a unique place worth checking out."
"PA","My experience was pretty tricky to review.  We entered and were really impressed with the atmosphere and then sat down at the bar and ordered some beers.  They all came out warm!  The bartender even said something about them being warm and they were unsure as to why that was.  She said all but one beer on tap was warm, and then offered a couple bottled beers that we could have.  After about twenty minutes they were all magically cold again so we tried some.  Between my group of 4 we tried pretty much all the beers and weren't really impressed with any of them.

The atmosphere of Church Brew Works is excellent, but the beers are not that great.  The food all sounded good, but we didn't try any.  If I'm in the area again I may come back to see if they have any different seasonal brews, and maybe try the food, but based on what I've seen so far I don't have particularly high expectations."
"PA","The Church Brew Works in the former St. John the Baptist church on Liberty Ave is one of my absolute favorite restaurants anywhere.  I've been here for lunch, dinner, happy hours, and special events (birthdays and wedding rehearsal dinners).  I don't even know where to begin.

They keep the place immaculate, and there really is no pun intended here.  It's gorgeous.  The atmosphere is unique, one could even say post-modern.  I could gush about the pleasure of having a tasty meal under a vaulting, airy ceiling with sunlight streaming through the stained glass windows... so I am.  I was raised Catholic in Pittsburgh and attended both the school and the church of St. Kieran's right up the road from here and, although not particularly holy myself now, have been broken hearted by how many of the gorgeous churches in the city were shuttered by the ruthless bishop, who ironically seems to have followed me to DC...  that's to say I think shutting down the spiritual centers of the inner city when they need them the most is more sacrilegious than turning one into a gorgeous restaurant and repurposing the building.

I digress to an absurd degree...the gouda dip appetizer is to die for here.  I crave it often  it's that good.  The pizza is truly delicious, and the Pittsburgh salad with chicken and fries on top is so much better than one could ever imagine just by thinking about that combo.  I get it with ranch and use it sparingly because the chicken is so flavorful and juicy.  Really, nothing here is bad - I've had the pierogies in many of their various daily forms and could easily make meals out of them they're that good.  They're ""real"" pierogies.  Delicious.  The chicken wrap was equally delicious, though I'm not sure if it's still on the menu.  Everything is fresh and simply seasoned but still tastes very sophisticated.  I've never had a bad meal here.

The Pious Monk beer is a must.  A must!  But if you don't drink alcohol, try their birch beer or ginger ale.  They make it all right there.

The ice cream is so good - I don't remember what's special about it, they use something left over from the brewing process like the sugar or something, but this with one of their absolutely delicious cups of coffee is the perfect way to end your meal.

Amazing.  I hope you'll love it.  Another place I'd recommend without reservation to out of towners - when I bring friends home to PGH with me I take them there and no one's been disappointed.  

Oh, the outdoor patio is wonderful!  It's intimate and comfortable."
"PA","Upon walking in the vaulted ceilings, stained glass, and brass brewing machinery really are a beautiful site to see. Like many other reviewers commented - the environment is pretty awesome. The food and service were pretty great--the meatloaf was delicious while the pierogies were only mediocre. Obviously there was a wide selection of self-brewed beers available. While portions were large the food and brews were a bit on the expensive side. Fair warning: When we went they were brewing something and the place had a definite hopps and cabbage smell...a smell that remained on us for a good 2-3 days. Nonetheless I'd recommend this place to anyone in Pittsburgh."
"PA","This place is great! Excellent atmosphere (it's so unique, you simply MUST try it), great beer choices (awesome sampler), cool food choices (and everything we had was good, not 5-star dining [come on, this is a beer pub], but definitely GOOD).  Our waiter was attentive and the musicians in the kilts with the accordions were darn entertaining (especially singing happy birthday to the entire venue)!  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and even took home some souvenirs.  We are definite fans!  

(Please ignore all the people who complained on this site, but didn't take the initiative to bring it to the attention of Church Brew Works so that they could rectify it immediately - the night we were there in September, the manager must have come by our table two or three times just to check on us - he was the one who actually took the initiative to get the musicians to play my guy a birthday song when I told him why we were there [his birthday] ... use your adult voices and say something next time you start to get that ""I'm not happy"" feeling - guaranteed a manager would want to fix the situation immediately. No one wants unhappy customers ""yelping"" dramatic negative reviews without the opportunity to make it right on the spot.)"
"PA","This place is awesome, if for nothing else the sacrilegiousness of the whole thing.  I love the stained glass windows, pews, and of course the brew kettles located right on the alter... It's a beer lovers religious experience. Also enjoyed the food too, but admittedly it's more about the atmosphere."
"PA","They have a good beer selection of which they make themselves. They had rattlesnake pierogies the first time I went.  Interesting to say the least but had a nice kick and enjoyed them. The pierogie pizza is awesome. i  have been there twice now and will make it a point to return."
"PA","Don't waste your time.

The pros:  Very pretty, beer is good, relatively inexpensive.

The cons:  Food is absolutely terrible.  In two trips, they served tasteless philly cheese steak (how is that even possible), and a quesadilla that was cold.  When I returned it to the waiter, they brought it back two minutes later, they had evidently just thrown it into the microwave.  Also the food took  more than an hour to arrive.

I will only go here if a group of friends forces me to go, and even then I will only drink.  Please don't bother taking anyone here for dinner."
"PA","It's sacril-icious."
"PA","The food is great.  I'd highly recommend the pierogies, Buffalo burger, or pizza.  My wife's favorite is the shrimp and grits.  We took our cousin from Atlanta, and he mentioned that he's never had better grits down south!  They have a lot of great brews, and the flight is a fantastic way to try them all.  We go here anytime we have friends/family in from out of town.  The venue offers a truly unique ambiance that you won't find anywhere else."
"PA","Really wish I had read some of the 1-2 star reviews before planning my fiance's birthday dinner here, which I had intended to be the perfect ending to a fun day touring Pittsburgh's breweries.   

I absolutely agree with every other reviewer that the service is appalling.  We were told to sit anywhere, so we grabbed a high table near the bar. We were ignored and made to feel unwelcome by our indifferent, bored, rude server with questionable hygiene.  The server, Antonio, did not introduce himself when he initially came around to take our order, the point at which servers usually welcome you to the establishment.  (We only discovered his name from the check at the end)  He simply asked how many were in the party, presumably so he could gauge what his tip would be.  Since there were only two of us (again, intimate dinner with fiance), he decided we weren't worth much effort.

We waited a long time for him to come around to take our order, so we decided instead of ordering appetizers and really savoring our meal, we'd just get a quick pizza.   The server realized the tab wouldn't be high since I wasn't going to be drinking and we weren't ordering soups, salads, or any appetizers so he decided right then we weren't worth even the most basic level of service.  

When the pizza finally came out, it had a 3-inch long curly black hair on it.  Both my fiance and I are dirty blonds, and the hair uncannily matched our lackadaisical server's unkempt black hair and unruly beard.    (hey I got nothing against beards by the way, my honey's got one, but this guy could use some trimmers)
 
After the hirsute discovery, we waited another 20 minutes or so for him to come around and check to see how the meal was so that I could point out the hair.  He didn't seem bothered but offered to get a new pizza for us, which took another 30 minutes. 

The pizza was so-so, and we had to wonder the whole time if there was anything 'extra' deposited in there by the annoyed waiter.

No surprise we waited a VERY VERY long time for the check.  I was considering just walking out but finally my fiance flagged down a waitress, told her we hadn't seen our server in a long time.  She asked for his name, which we didn't know at that point, and then asked for a physical description.  Since this place has 30 high- school/college-aged kids working there, our description happened to fit that of another dark-haired, beardy unkempt kid walking by.   (I know I'm making myself sound old here, but I've reached my third decade and I feel I've earned it, I have worked in the service industry and it's not that hard to provide the minimum level of service and courtesy).

FINALLY, Antonio appeared, perfunctorily provided the check and finally gratefully we were on our way.

I wanted to complain to management, but I never saw any, and based on some other reviews, I doubt it would have accomplished anything.  It seems management is going out of their way to teach bad manners to the waitstaff.

Oh and the gimmick of being in an old church with pretty stained glass windows and brewery equipment where the altar once was, wears off real quick.   

First and last time here.  Ruined our night and put a sour taste in our mouth after a day which had been fun up until this stop.  Not only will we NEVER go back here, we won't be buying their beers at any distributor ever again.    Do not come here on a special occasion, in fact, don't waste your time or money here at all.   There are plenty of other awesome microbreweries opening up who will be serving food, and eventually may put this dump out of business."
"PA","I had some of the best cheese pizza of my life here. The garlic level of the pizza was absolutely perfect. There was soooo much garlic, but still not too much! The beer was also delicious and the ambience was super cool. It has a similar feel to haufbrauhaus without the kitschiness."
"PA","Nice spot to grab a beer or three. Beer sampler was the way to go, every beer on tap and  3-4 oz each. Food was not a bright spot and staff at the pub side was a bit overwhelmed and unfocused."
"PA","My brother had his birthday luncheon at CBW today and sent us a pix message showing us exactly what we were missing.  I called up CBW and had them send over a dessert for him (which they comped) and the waitress told them it was from us.  EXTREMELY satisfied with how they went about helping us out and helped him celebrate his birthday.

The beers are great, the pizza is great, the pierogies are great. So go there.

Big ups to Blaise and Susie at CBW. Many Thanks!

The only negative thing is we weren't there to enjoy it with our family."
"PA","Great place to take out of town guests.  My best tip for you is to ask for the bar menu, the food is better, and less expensive.  The Pizza is delicious and creative.  The decor is impressive, although I find the lighting a little too dark.  This place has excellent food and wonderful beer.  Great for groups.  There's additional parking in the back, but I often park on the street."
"PA","For a place known for its beer, the food is shockingly amazing"
"PA","Now this is my kind of church!!  I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing when I made my first visit earlier this week!  It was a real church, serving food and beer.....and I loved it!  We had the wood-fired pizza and some Celestial Gold.  Beer was good, and pizza (Spinach, Feta and Artichoke) was excellent.  Service was good as well.  Will definitely return!"
"PA","I am a fan though the smell is something to be aware of. I went for lunch and the food is fantastic. I did sample a couple of beers and they were very tasty. We got great service as well. I would not do another lunch for fear that smell may linger on me long after I leave. I recommend trying this place when you are interested in a good night with your friends.

I would not take my wife (read girlfriend for you single folk) here although she may want a pizza or burger brought home..."
"PA","Great venue. Hence the 4 stars.

2 hour wait?! I had high expectations for the food.
Food was nothing spectacular. Had the mushroom pesto pizza, which was good. Again, nothing special for the price and wait for a seat. I was excited to try the curried pumpkin soup with spicy shrimp and cilantro crema. I was hoping it would have been more pumpkin than curry. The curry was a bit overpowering so I felt like I was literally eating curry. :/

My beer was delish and worth it. Home brews and brewed well! I think they're all great."
"PA","The food here is probably 2/5 stars, but the view is amazing.  Maybe it's just because I'm new to the Burgh, but how cool is it to walk in to a church and see the light gleaming in from the stained glass and landing on half a dozen polished brew tanks?  It feels so wrong, but looks so cool!

I would definitely come back here to show visiting family and friends...probably not on my own though--at least for the food."
"PA","Let me start out with saying... when I order a wrap from a menu at a sit down restaurant, the only time it should be cold is when I am digging into my doggie bag the next day at lunch. Although it was tasteful, why was it cold?!?! 

The only beer here worth your time is the seasonal xmas ale. The rest is meh.

And the server? HORRIBLE. He was completely rude to me the whole night. Even my boyfriend brought up that he was short. And I am not talking height here. I was a server once, I understand one gets ""in the weeds"" so to speak. But this guy had a snood comment for everything I tried to say, which to him, was only trying to order. 

I think my issue with this place is I think the concept is so good that I want it to live up to it's expectations. Sadly, it does not."
"PA","Twister, a fantastic movie showing the true power of mother nature along with the splendid acting of Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton. Who can forget the moment they survived an F5 tornado due to the sturdiness of a belt. I am 99% positive leather belt sales skyrocketed in the tornado alley region that year. 

Who knew that the sometimes dastardly mother nature was also able to make an appearance within Pittsburgh itself? The Church Brew Works is a twister of dark Belgian flavors and delicious edibles making for a destructive good time in ones taste buds.

Like the dark clouds rolling in during a storm, the Church Brew Works has dim lighting which really works with it's church like atmosphere.

Last evening I tried the southwest wrap which really was a cyclone of flavor that dances along the roof of your mouth and slides into your stomach to make a splash of satisfaction. The sweet potato fries refuse to be bullied by its larger counterpart, the cyclone and make a bold statement of sweet goodness that will in fact explode on ones tongue as it creates fireworks of sensational prowess (Yes I said prowess).

But alas I bring you to the beer. The decision was made to try the seasonal due to the festivities that are afoot with Christmas. The Biere De Noel is a lightning storm of electric charged bolts that will pierce through the frowns of any person to find them joy despite their Grinch like nature. The only issue with this storm of a beer is that you will want more than you should have. A designated driver is recommended on this twister of a tale my friends. 

In conclusion, twister is a great movie but more more importantly The Church Brew Works is the sequel. That is all."
"PA","Talk about a one-of-a-kind place, a church that was converted into a brewery. Pure genius! I was told about this place before visiting my friend in Pittsburgh and made it a must stop.

I feel like this is a place you find in some town in Ireland and England, but I think it's a good fit in Pittsburgh. I wish DC had more places like this and less of the wine/tapas bars variety.

I really like how the owner kept the original decor of the church intact and didn't try to alter it too much.

This place is more than just gimmicks, it's microbrews were delicious and the service was very friendly."
"PA","This is my kind of place - an old church with a lot of gothic architectural detail, converted into a bar and restaurant with their brewery equipment upon the altar.  I can dig it.

My room mates and I went here for a celebratory meal, this being my first week in Pittsburgh.  Our waitress was super friendly and helpful.  We ordered the brew sampler (the dunkel and the stout are definitely my speed), which included some seasonal beers.  I'm looking forward to what they might brew this winter.  Additionally we ordered the Spinach, Gouda & Feta dip as an appetizer and it was nothing short of spectacular, I highly recommend it (comes with pita triangles).  We shared a Chicken & Andouille pizza which tasted good with its high quality ingredients, including fresh tomatoes.

Whenever you feel like chillin' in a church, sippin' a brew (which for some people might be every Sunday), this is the place to go."
"PA","I'm so a fan of this place! It's an actual old church with a brewery on the pulpit! The food is good, the pizza's are great, they're made in a brick oven (or taste like they are), the couscous salad is phenom, and the while they have a small selection of brewed on-site beers, it's totally quality over quantity. I haven't had a beer there that wasn't yummy and interesting. 

The mango curry was very disappointing, and the chipotle ketchup for the sweet potato fries is lacking any major flavor (the fries themselves are yummy though).

Beautiful decor inside and wonderful quiet beer garden outside. Always a blast!!"
"PA","Sweet place, but a little sacreligious with the distilleries on the church's diases...  Ergo, it's an awesome time!  The micro-brews are cool, and I'd recommend getting the seasonal ale!  The food is on par with high end chain restaurants, their appetizers are out of this world though!  It's wallet friendly, but not so nice to the arteries!"
"PA","My expectations were shattered.  
This place has the best potential ... NEVER realized.  

The ambiance was sad.  They could do so much better.
The service was just ok.
The food was awful.
They only brew 3 beers, and only serve those 3 on tap.

We had the daily special perogies.  They were grose.
We had the 5 cheese pizza.  It was slightly burnt, and the bottom was all icky black from a dirty pizza oven.  So it tasted like burnt crust dust.

This place looks like it'll be cool .. don't get fooled."
"PA","A lot's been written, so I'll try to be brief.  I was here on Saturday with a couple friends, place was packed but found ample seating at the bar.  The space is gorgeous, high ceilings, organ, pipes, stained glass, etc.  This place has outdoor seating, however I always seem to forget.  It has delicious brick oven pizza, with fresh sauce, and perfectly cooked cheese.  I only wish their crust was thinner.  The wine selection sucks, but the spirits offered are pretty ample.  They won't offer samples of the cask conditioned, which is okay because all there beer is pretty good and they offer samples of all the rest.  The stout was below average.  I had their ""kobe"" steak sandwich, for $11,,, really?? ""kobe""?? Either way, perfecty acceptable sandwich and the sweet potato fries are a nice touch.  Friend had the salmon, she said it was delicious and cooked perfectly.  We tried the brie, which was about c level brie with nice breading and figs (nice touch!), the non-traditional perogies were no good, overcooked, overpriced and underflavored.  The service was better than most.  The bathrooms were big enough, with no lines that I saw, which was surprising with so much beer being drunk,,, Oh well, I guess it's not possible for me to write a short review.  There's always next time."
"PA","The third piece of the trilogy - read my other reviews - is this microbrewery-turned-church, the last one of my three most favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. With Catholic background and dwindling population and culture, Pittsburgh has lots of old church buildings that are converted into a completely new venue. One of the other places is called Sanctuary, which is a three-story club now, and it's quite awesome inside. This place, when you walk in, imposes the brew house that's sitting where the altar used to be. Above the setup it has a Latin phrase that went something like ""our god, eternal light..."", and the angels flying around in the stained glasses are smiling down on you with bottles in their hands. I don't know what will happen to the religious state of mind if a devout Christian walks in here. Maybe it will explode. But I think it's awesome that instead of tearing this structure down they decided to add a spin to the place and make a great use out of it. It's part of the memory of the community - not that I was part of the specific neighborhood, but still - and you should be able to live with the changing times and at least be thankful that most part of what the church used to be is still providing people shelter and utility.

Anyways, back to more important matters. The setup makes you feel you're at an indoor beer garden. The echoing of chitter-chatters are somewhat unique because there's no church music or bar music playing in the background. So imagine you're a monk and you step into the dining area of your monastry, except you're in the 21st century. Food: excellent, the large pizzas are quite massive and massively tasty so be prepared to share it with at least one other people (two guys should share one, or three girls, or four kids... you get the idea). I think the pizza guy Their other food was also great. Beer: fantastic. The most memorable one was their dark ale, which they roast the malt enough so that the color is darker and the flavor is, duh, roasty, and grainy. I wonder if they sell their bottled beers in other states too. Again, I miss you too. I'll be back someday."
"PA","The novelty of the setting can only carry your experience so far. The food itself was sad and frustrating - especially considering the price of some dishes.

As I looked over the menu, I noticed one consistency: most dishes sounded very ordinary or even boring except for one or two incongruous ingredients. It is as if they are trying to make everything different or special by adding an arbitrary distinction.

My dinner started with the Seven Onion soup. Arbitrary Distinction #1. Are onions really so varied in flavor once cooked in broth and cheese that using seven varieties will create a nuanced dish? Well, it was decent but no different than French Onion soup anywhere else, made with six fewer onions no doubt.

After the dinner menu failed to pique my appetite, I ordered the Turkey and Swiss sandwich from the pub menu. It arrived on pumpernickel slices, plain and untoasted like an elementary school lunch. This brown bagger of a sandwich consisted of dry turkey crumbles paired with greens and red onion but no moisture. The occasional taste of cranberry? Arbitrary distinction #2. I found myself painting it in ranch dressing and sucking down water just to be able to swallow without choking.

One table mate ordered the mussels dish. I noticed him rubbing the white sauce from the meat onto the garlic bread and I soon realized why. After biting into the bread with the sauce, I found myself being force to spit it into a napkin. The white sauce was so salty, bus loads of Jewish tourists could float on the surface of it. The bread was harshly peppered. They were inedible.

Another table mate's dish included a lemon aioli (#3) that was runny and astringent, as if flavored with Pledge Multisurface. Another had the southwesty wrap (I forget the name) and only ate the insides. The reason was a tortilla that was spicy enough to choke a person (#4). Want to dip your fries in my chipotle ketchup (#5)? I'll pass.

I'm glad that the service was attentive because my palate needed those four water refills. Some advice, Brew Works? Pick a dish one at a time and refine it. Make it delicious. Your food doesn't need novelty condiments and bizarre pairings to be unique and memorable. It just needs to be good."
"PA","This restaurant ruined my New Year's Eve! My husband and I made a reservation for 10pm, thinking it would be a fun place to be at midnight - we were wrong. We were told we had the table for 2 hours, and there were all sorts of rules about how you couldn't cancel or be late or else they'd charge you. We were a few minutes early, and pretty much the first thing our server said to us when we sat down was, ""Our kitchen is about to close."" Why they take reservations for 10pm if that's when the kitchen closes, I can't imagine. So, we quickly put in our order (we both wanted their special New Year's Eve 3 course prix fixe menu), and continued to be rushed through the entire meal. 

The appetizer was disappointing - my husband ordered Fried Goat Cheese and the portion was so teeny tiny; the cheese pieces were about the size of a dime. I had the Cioppino, which was supposed to be mussels, scallops, and shrimp in a lobster-saffron broth. There was no shrimp, and the mussels and scallops were so miniature that they had no flavor whatsoever. The broth and garlic bread were good.

While we were still eating our appetizers they brought out the soup/salad course, which is so rude and made us feel rushed. My husband's Lobster Bisque was good, but again, very small portion. I had the Roasted Cauliflower Salad, which turned out to be an arugula salad, garnished with a few small shavings of cauliflower.

Again, while we were still eating our soup/salad, they brought out our entree, and by that time we were pretty annoyed and asked if they could keep the entrees hot while we finished our current course. Our server was visibly impatient/annoyed and said that her manager didn't want our entrees in the window, but agreed to bring them back anyway. When we were finished and she brought our entrees back out they were lukewarm. The flavors were good, but would have been much better if prepared/served at the appropriate time.

Then we asked to see the dessert menu and our server said no, the kitchen is closed. We asked to speak to the manager. Miraculously, the kitchen was not actually closed. We had dessert - my Malted Bread Pudding was good, but my husband's Carrot Cake was way too gingery.

Through each course, the staff was cleaning around us, making us feel even more rushed, and we couldn't even have a normal conversation because they were hovering so much. Our server was acting like she couldn't wait for us to leave.

When we were finished and it was time to pay, the manager finally came out. He glazed over the whole issue and did not listen to our complaints. By that time we felt so unwelcomed, we just wanted to get out of there. So, we were actually driving home when the clock struck midnight. So disappointing!

I don't know how this place would be on a regular night, but I definitely would stay away from it on any sort of special occasion. I am just shocked by how unprofessional they were on every level."
"PA","Updating my original review--  on these cold winter days, I strongly recommend the perogie pizza.  It really warms you up.  I think this menu item is much more appropriate to order in winter than on a hot summer day, like what I did last time.

Still five stars, great restaurant."
"PA","Church Brew Works was one of the highlights of my visit in Pittsburgh. The church where they've set up shop is in excellent condition, and the huge amount of space inside is all used effectively.  The entire place was packed when we visited on a Saturday night around 8:00. They had a large number of draft selections in an equally large range of styles, all available in taster flight portions. Our server was quick and attentive, the prices were reasonable, and the overall setting was comfortably between calm and lively.  Parking was easy to find just down the street and we found seats at a table near the bar right away."
"PA","Cheap beer, neat setting, lots of seating but fairly quiet on a Saturday night around 11pm...I was pretty hyped in coming to this place but the vibe there was just too quiet and they didn't really have a lot of beer selection, altho they did have their own brewery in the background"
"PA","Let's just throw it out now - if I have guests or friends coming to town, this is the top place on my list. So unique, good food, great beverages, and usually very good service.

I have been here many times, for office parties, and just for snacks. I don't think I have ever had to wait for a table, the food is high end bar food (I mean that in the nicest way) and is well portioned so you are always on the verge of finishing or having a small take-home, and the beers are great with an always available seasonal variety along with the regulars. They have a nice outdoor patio for the good weather seasons. 

I guess the only thing that is inconsistent here are the servers - we have usually had above average servers but occasionaly you will get one that feels too busy and is just running the food around such that you may wait on drinks. That is how I would capture our most recent visit - sat in the bar area at a table and the server was friendly at first but eventually had trouble coming back to check on us very often.

Some cool things - they give you samples normally if you want to decide on a drink, and if you want to buy a growler to take home, these are a good deal because they allow for cheap future fill-ups on your next visit."
"PA","Now you won't find Friar Tuck swigging away the mead at CBW, but you'll be sinfully delighted to partake in a little yourself. And no, you won't hear Handel's Messiah here, just the hiss and pop of the stills. The smell of hops and barley has long ago replaced sacred incense. Imbibing home crafted brews has since supplanted conducting elaborately scripted and ritualistic rites.

And the monks would doubtlessly have had it no other way. 

Places like this really bring out my inner apologist. So come to CBW to see brewing, consuming and selling alcohol in a sanctuary. Then buy a shirt, have a shot and flirt with a waitron.

The owners have truly gotten back to the whole point of Christendom."
"PA","This place holds a special place in my food-loving heart. As two people who love irony, my husband and I thought after eloping in Allegheny County Night Court, there would be no better place to have a ""reception"" than a church converted into a brewery. It's a cool space and worth a visit, though it is packed on weekend evenings.

My favorite on the dinner menu -- chicken pot pie! I love that it's not thick and goopy and that the topper is puff pastry and not traditional pie crust. On the pub menu -- LOVE the Southwest Chicken Wrap and traditional pierogies. Husband is a fan of the salmon. 

I am giving it a 4 because the service has never been stellar -- typically if you're not sitting at the bar, you have to ask for the pub menu, which has pizza and sandwich options. I don't really get that -- because it's pretty much the old center aisle of the church that divides the bar side from the ""dining room"". But I have gotten a surly hostess (same one) on two occasions. No real greeting, no eye contact. So yeah, if you can get past that, the food is always spot on and tasty in my experience.

Oh! And the smell, it is distinctive. It doesn't bother me -- however, if you're turned off by woody, earthy smells -- you might want to skip.

Hehe, update -- another Yelper read this review and messages me that they actually changed their menu several months ago and don't have Chicken Pot Pie. Bummer to hear, but please note -- I was there 3-4 days before I wrote that review, I went there specifically for it and I didn't bother checking the menu. Our server simply  told me ""they didn't have that tonight"". Wish I would have known they don't have it ever!"
"PA","Sippin beer and church pews in the bathroom.
Sounds weird right?  

We went here for a staff dinner our first night in Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere was visually awesome.  So many things to look at and the beer was amazing.

I will say if you intend to take advantage of the specials of the day, you should plan to get out earlier in the evening."
"PA","Really fresh, unique beers. Loved the pumpkin stout.
Good food, had the pierogies, very buttery. 
Excellent friendly service"
"PA","I had been wanting to visit the Church Brew Works ever since seeing it featured on the Food Network show Outrageous Food. In that episode, they featured the restaurant's ""rattlesnake pierogies"" I was disappointed to find this was not a regular menu item, instead they offer either ""traditional"" or ""untraditional"" pierogies- on the night of our visit the untraditional ones were Bufflale Chicken style, and boy were they good! I still want to try those rattlesnake ones though...

I also had the onion soup and the bison meatloaf which were both delicious, especially the meatloaf. My spouse enjoyed the jambalaya which was nice and spicy. As to the beers, there was a decent selection of styles from lager to dunkel to belgian to stout....and our server accomodated our request to sample some of the brews before deciding. Our favorite of the night was the Thunderhop which had a wonderful hoppy flavor. 

As to the ambiance- well I think it is well worth a trip if you are in Pittsburgh. The restaurant is a converted church complete with stained glass windows and wooden pews (ok they are not the most comfortable seats but it adds to the effect!) and where the alter would have been are the giant beer tanks.

We found the service to be very prompt and our server answered all our questions concerning beer and food.

I thought this restaurant was a good value for the money. Dinner for two was just under $70 before tip- and our meal included 4 pints of beer, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. 

Visited August 2011"
"PA","This place is a one-of-a-kind  paradise that EVERYONE should visit at least once whether they live in the 'burgh or are just visiting. No doubt about it, the atmosphere is incredible with the huge multicolored glass of the large window that sits behind the pipe organ in the balcony. The high vaulted ceiling, incredible stained glass windows, and magnificent positioning of the brew equipment at the altar all contribute to this stunning effect. 

Sadly, if I was still underage like when I used to visit as a child, I'd be giving this place 5 stars. But unfortunately, since this place emphasizes the quality of its beer I am forced to subtract stars. I tried about 8 of their different beers and did not fine a single one that I would enjoy a pint of.  Additionally, I find the food is overpriced for the amount and quality.

So definitely check this place out. I always take out-of-town visitors here and continue to hope that I will find one of their beers that I enjoy. Until then, I'll enjoy the stunning environment and the satisfaction that I get out of drinking in a church."
"PA","This place was awesome (well except for the fact that smoking is allowed in Pittsburgh).  Felt very much like it should be in Seattle.  The stained glass and gothicness very much made this place quite sweet!  was kind of a long walk from downtown but worth it."
"PA","Great place great atmosphere!  Was a Sunday afternoon so was fairly low key but loved the atmosphere inside (not to mention the a/c, a necessity for me being from Seattle).  Food was great - only complaint is I ordered a beer that was supposed to be some type of ""blueberry"" beer - didn't taste a hint of blueberry, only beer.  Friendly staff and nice place."
"PA","Driving around Pittsburgh in search of the quintessential Pittsburgh dining experience, we motored past the Church Brew Works and had to stop. A church? An altar mounted with brewing equipment, producing luscious beers worthy of the Viking gods? 

We hit the brakes and parked the car. I've never spent more than a few minutes in a church save for the requisite dull hum of a wedding ceremony, so I was rather amazed at the scale of the place. The literal cathedral ceiling, tables as far as the eye can see, a lone pizza man plying his trade just to the right of the altar, where beer was in process before being transferred to kegs or bottles and served at the restaurant. The church, oddly, has the feel of an Eastern European brewhouse; outside of the setting, it doesn't have much character or charm.

We ordered perogis and pizza. The perogis were good, but the pizza wasn't anything special. The crust was too sweet and too short, the sauce lack brightness or vigor, and the cheese just sat there, holding the whole thing together. The beer really stood out as the star of the show. I had the summer special hefeweizen, and my companion had the IPA x2. We loved them both. 

This is definitely a must-see for anyone passing through town. Come for beers and atmosphere, but plan to have your dinner elsewhere."
"PA","A fun place to go with a big group of people.  GREAT selection of beers.  I had the pierogies last time I was there and they were excellent.  Also tried a bit of someone's pizza and it was excellent as well.  

Can't beat a place that has great food, beer, and interesting atmosphere."
"PA","I mean. This is ok. The atmosphere is great, the whole converted church to brewery thing is cool. The food is not vegetarian friendly. Very few options, and really the food is only alright. So go for the beer not the eats."
"PA","Arguably, the Church Works has the best atmosphere I've ever encountered in a restaurant, as their location inside an old church is certainly unique.  With a pizza oven and a brewery near the old altar, it almost feels sacrilegious eating there.  But in a good way.  

Food wise, The Church Works is pretty good, with large portions, and a big and diverse menu.  Their pizza is probably their best dish. 

If you're ever in Pittsburgh, definitely stop by, as it's one of the few places I've encountered where you can sin and eat at the same time."
"PA","Drink of this beer, for it is my blood.
Eat of these pierogies, for it is my body.
Do this in remembrance of me.

AMEN.

In the land of Pittsburgh sits a beautiful church that was decommissioned and tanks of beer were placed at the altar to be exalted.  Thank you baby jesus!

Church Brew Works & Restaurant is an amazing place. I suggest checking out the website to really see what this place looks like.

It is sorta like a beerhall inside and they have an outdoor courtyard in the back which is equally beauteous. They brew lots of yummy beer and the munchies are primarily German influenced.  Eating pierogies and drinking big glasses of beer was just like heaven. The only sin was this flavored creme brulee, which tasted burnt and just awful.

On the way out, friends and I saw a humongous slug on the landscaping retaining wall trailing a nice snotty line behind it."
"PA","Just got back from Pittsburgh for work, and enjoyed many of the restaurants the city had to offer.  This one especially, which we visited twice on our one week stay.
Yah, one can say it's sacriligious to drink beer in a building that was once used as a Catholic Church, but I think God has a sense of humor too! The building is beautiful, stained glass windows, and the alter used as a brewery.  The restaurant brews their own beer on site, and has many options, ones I've never tried before. I ordered a beer similiar to a budlight. The food is delicious!! We had the spinach dip and pita bread as an appetizer, and the vegetarian pizza and fish sandwhich as entrees. Both were very tasty and the portions were humungous. Definitely not somewhere to go if you are on a diet, even if you order a salad, everywhere in Pittsburgh they put french fries on their salads!! Weird.
The service was great both times we went. Very helpful and informative of the city and the restaurant. I even purchased the beer glasses that said ""And on the 8th day, man created beer!"" I would defintely recommend this place if you are ever in the area, and feeling a little adventurous :-)"
"PA","This place is a must see. It's all about the experience really. Walking through the doors of a once Roman Catholic Church for dining is truly unique. We never forgot that we were dining in an old church. Beautiful building inside and out with stain glass and pipe organ nestled in the back of the church. The beer was fantastic! The food was very good but the menu was not what I was expecting. They didn't have the normal pub menu choices but that did make it unique. The beet salad with honey vinaigrette and goat cheese was good and the Cajun sweet potatoes were the best I've had.  Main complaint was parking was hard to find on the weekend and the food was pricey. The beer was reasonably priced."
"PA","The church itself is absolutely stunning and it blows you away as soon as you walk in. The food is good, not exceptional but good - try the Mexican pizza if you are a vegetarian. Our party was split on whether or not we liked the pierogie pizza. The beer is nothing to write home about - but everything else made it a great spot to stop by as we drove through Pittsburgh!"
"PA","I very rarely give anything 5 stars which should go to saying how much I liked this place.  

My wife and I stopped in on a Sunday shortly after they opened while on a road trip. We were kind of apprehensive based on some of the reviews on yelp but since this was the only brewery open on Sunday we figured how bad could it actually be. 

To our great surprise it was amazing.  

The service was top notch
The food was great and very original
The beer was well balanced and while they had some simple flag ships they also had some amazing experimental brews.
The space....Whats there to say about a church being turned into a brewery other than AWESOME!

If you are ever in the area make it a point to stop in and check this brewery out. They have been around for 17 years so they are not just jumping on the craft beer crazy but have put years of work into perfecting their brand and beer."
"PA","I want to like this place, I really do.  That's part of the reason we go back, that and the friendly staff. 

It is a great setting, I love the concept and I am convinced that they are on the edge of really having something special.

However, at the end of the day the food is letting down what has the potential to be an awesome overall experience.

Tonight I had the meatloaf.  I'm not a big fan of meat loaf, but as is one of their signature dishes so I thought I'd try it.  Ugkh!  The entire meal was incredibly salty, way over salty.  I mean borderline inedible.  The meatloaf itself was dry and not appealing and the rest of the plate just went down hill from there. 

My wife had the Salmon.  Salmon is usually a pretty safe dish, but in this case it was again, a little dry and just not appetizing.   However, the it came with similar sides to the meatloaf and bam there goes the saltiness again.

Our three kids had three different meals, hard to screw up pasta or perogies or pizza.  Well you would think, except the pizza arrived a good 5 minutes after the other meals, was overcooked and again heavily salted.  

All in all we want to like this place.  The staff are always friendly, as they were again tonight, and I'll admit to having a soft spot for their Celestial Gold, but we may have to take a break for a while.  Been stung once too often lately to be going back anytime soon.

I really hope that they sort out their food."
"PA","Unique location and good food, the flags remind me at my original home (Bavaria), can recommend the pizza and the carrot cake :)"
"PA","The fries are the perfect combination of crisp and salty and, of course, they are served with Heinz ketchup. I enjoyed sipping on the Pious Monk Dunkel, but wish I had tried the Pumpkin Stout. The Chicken Sausage Sandwich had a bit of a spicy kick to it, but the kick was tampered by the aiolis that coated the soft sweet bun."
"PA","I wish I lived in Pittsburgh!!!!!!!

Church Brew Works is the neatest restaurant I've ever been to. Talk about re-purposing an old, unused building! Let this be an example to all cities with churches (and buildings of any type) that are sitting unused and/or derelict. This restaurant gives ""re-purpose"" a whole new meaning. 

Only downside with re-purposing a building like this is the acoustics. Because the walls and ceiling don't have any shock absorbancy, sound is not absorbed and it gets *very* loud in here! We came here late at night, 9pm on a Friday. It was packed and loud. The way tables and booths are laid out gives every party privacy without putting up huge dividers. It's reminiscent of being in a mess hall or what I think of a dining area to be like in Henry VIII's court back in the Middle Ages. Just an openness you don't get in most dining experiences. 

The church has pews, stained glass and a pulpit area, which has also been re-purposed into a brewing station, which may or may not be considered blasphemous! 

The food was very good, though a little on the stodgy side. I made the mistake of eating some of a pierogi appetizer that my companions ordered, forgetting that I had ordered the special that night which was cheese and potato pierogis. Way too heavy; I would have been better off eating a salad. I also tried some of the spinach and cheese dip, which was incredible!!!

Of course, the main attraction is the beer. And boy, do they make good beer! I had the Octoberfest, which seemed to be the most popular. It was the best I've had. Also tried the pumpkin beer, which was delicious, as well!

Can't wait to come back here next time I'm in town."
"PA","This is one of our favorite places in Pittsburgh. We always bring out of town guests and they always love it.

Last night we had a special experience there. We went for their Oktoberfest Brewers Dinner, a five-course dinner with paired beers. It was wonderful. All of the courses were delicious and the beers were a good match. They started it off with an off-menu pumpkin stout. You could drink it all night it was so good. But, it was just the start. There was definitely a lot of beer to be drunk, pun intended. They also included some of their souvenir glasses at the end.

Sitting down with us was one of the brewers, Justin Viale. Justin was a lot of fun to be with and his sharing of his brewing knowledge and CBW experience added to the evening. The chef, Joe Kiefer, came out with each course to explain it. Great job, Joe.

Finally, we learned these special dinners are put on every other month. We thought this was an Oktobefest only event. We'll be going back for more!"
"PA","Our lager, 
Which art in barrels, 
Hallowed be Thy drink, 
Thy will be drunk, 
At home as I am in the tavern...

Ok, now that that's over with I do have to say this is by far the coolest brewpub I've ever been to. Granted, it's a long way away in PA, but thankfully I get to take regular trips to get my pierogi and church fix. 

Not like I really needed a church fix.

Anyway, here's my lowdown:
- Get the beer sampler and then choose the beer you want. That is, of course, if you don't already live in Pittsburgh and don't know what the hell kind of beer they brew.

- Then get the IPA. It's hoptastic.

- Order some pierogies. There are two types - unusual and usual. Why get usual? Go for the unusual.

- Then there's a pierogi pizza. If you're getting the pierogi appetizer you probably don't need a whole pizza. But I'm real tempted to go back and try it because honestly, pierogi pizza. Some Italian Russian is spinning in his grave.

- Skip the pulled pork sandwich and beer cheese. Neither is all that good or special or memorable.

Oh - and make sure you use the bathroom. I don't know about the men's room, but the ladies is awesome. It's like a choir green room in a bar! A BAR IN A CHURCH! AH!!!!!!

And the booths use the pews for chairs! Gar! I love this place."
"PA","I have been to Church Brew Works twice now when visiting friends in Pittsburgh and I wish that I could magically transport this place to New York.  It's a cool concept, but I can see how it could have gone horribly wrong and been really cheesy - thankfully, this is not the case at all.  I absolutely love the feel of the restaurant, especially the stained glass.  The servers are knowledgeable about their beers and happy to offer suggestions (I went with the excellent Celestial Gold).  We started out with pierogies, which were nothing short of phenomenal - order them, they are a life-changing level of good.  I also had the Shinkasa cheesesteak (Kobe beef, grilled onions and red peppers, and melted provolone), which was quite tasty.  All around a fantastic experience!"
"PA","What could be better than drinking beer in a place that used to be a church? NOTHING! I love to be sacrilegious as much as the next beer swilling fiend and this place hit the nail on the head. Church is giant, and full of people, but don't let that detract you. The wait staff are very efficient and the food and drink are worth the wait. It's always a great time in the Burgh and I can't wait to visit church again!"
"PA","This is my first review on Yelp, as I was waiting for a truly inspirational experience about which to write. After Church Brew Works, one might say I was born again.

I was in Pittsburgh for the first time this past week, attending a conference for work. The conference, while worth the travel in and of itself, more importantly provides an excellent chance to reconnect with colleagues from around the country. Thus, I was looking forward to the unstructured time in evenings, and choosing the gathering place for such periods is a delicate art. I ended up spending two nights at Church Brew Works, and it's not as though there was a lack of options. This place is special.

The first night, I went to CBW after dinner. Upon arrival, I ordered the sampler to split with a friend, to get our bearings and at least have a taste of the four mainstays and the four seasonals. The sampler was priced right at around $14 for eight five-ounce glasses. While I was less excited by some brews (like the Celebration), I was amazed by the complexity of both the Rotating Stout and the Four-Grain Harvest Ale. I drank Harvest Ales until they kicked us out that night.

The second night, we headed back to CBW for dinner. This night, I drank Rotating Stout exclusively. Very crisp for a stout, with an awesome smokey finish. I ordered the salmon entree for dinner. For $19, I figured it had to be good. Plus, the drafts were very reasonably priced, so I didn't mind spending a bit more on food. The salmon truly exceeded my expectations. It was perfectly cooked with minimal seasoning and placed atop a refreshing quinoa salad with cucumber. Sauteed oyster mushrooms accompanied the fish, which were delicious. The plate was ringed with a tasty soy reduction to provide salt, which complemented all the items perfectly. I could see how the soy might have been a bit strong for someone else, but I think it brought an appropriate kick to the dish.

I continued to drink the Rotating Stout all night while we discussed the eventual collapse of civil society. Perfect conversation against the backdrop of an altar filled with heavy brewing equipment. There is something post-apocalyptic yet fantastically optimistic about CBW. Perhaps it's the not-so-subtle notion that our reverie should not be focused on a deity hovering in the heavens or a member of the clergy thumping on the pulpit, but rather, toward one another, in a place where the provisions nourish the soul and the communion is about building community."
"PA","Good food great atmosphere as long as you don't mind being in a church... or a place that used to be a church"
"PA","The setting is gorgeous.  The beer is good.  And the jambalaya is nice and spicy."
"PA","Sean & Staff, Autumn & myself totally enjoyed everything off your food menu as well as the great Brew's. Was a great experience, & i was reluctant to go. I'm a transplant from Md. & i  have never seen  anything like your great establishment, and will recommend The Church Brew Works to anyone & everyone ! Just another reason why I love this great city of Pittsburgh, & that I'm proud to say is home. See you soon."
"PA","Just went to the restaurant last weekend for the first time. The ambiance is great. I loved the stained glass, and big open space. As a former cathlic it felt slightly sacreligious but I got over it quickly when I tasted the food. It was so hard to decide the menu was so diverse. It was great. We shared a pierogie appetizer, so creamy and delicious. Mom had the seven onion soup and she loved it. We were going to have a pizza but there was an hour wait for it to even get in the oven. So we ended up sharing a pulled pork sandwich and home-made fries.

Sept 2008 = Just went back for a second visit and it was even better, if that's possible. I finally got to try the pizza and it was AMAZING."
"PA","Maybe the best beer in the burgh (though the sharp edge's selection really can't be touched). The pizzas are great (better when they had the southwest). 
They'd get all 5 stars if they brought back the southwest pizza. the managers and staff are really cool people too. My wife and I became regulars for a time there and got to know a lot of them. 
The desserts are really good too!"
"PA","Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop...

in a church setting.

Not like hofbrauhaus, however it is still a very nice place to go. The ambience however is kind of odd, but if you like beer, it is worth a trip definitely."
"PA","Just as Soba is THE place for a cozy cocktail + conversation combo, CBW is THE place for party pitchers + pizza pleas-ahhh.

Many, MANY a happy drunken night spent at CBW. Fabulous micro-brews (really, really delicious) + great wait staff (well, most of the time... Props to Joe, my long-suffering long-haired hilarious hero. Always fun) = YAY!

P.S. Sorry about the alliteration. Sometimes I can't keep the dork at bay."
"PA","This was always a ""must see"" when I had visitors in town.  I never loved the food, but the atmosphere is what makes it.  Oh... and the beer.  So this was a must stop for a night cap with co-workers while back in town for work.  I love all the ales - the amber I had last night was very hoppy with a good bite. 

Being catholic, I always kind of feel a little sinful here, which is very thrilling!"
"PA","Ok, this place has such a mix of reviews that I know they can't be all true. Come on, give me a break. If I hadn't eaten here on numerous occasions, I wouldn't know what to think. Some days the beer is fantastic and some days it sucks? I think NOT!  

I think that the ups and downs noted are just a matter of individual taste . . . or perhaps, lack of.

I say . . .go try it for yourself.

The fact that it is a restaurant and brew works that has been put in an old church is worth the trip alone. Worth it just to see what can be done with a great old building and a little imagination.

Try the beer. Have lunch or dinner. See what you think. Don't let a few misguided souls scare you off. 

I've usually found that when a place has so many reviews that are so across the board it is because some folks get out of their comfort zone . . . they begin to get uncomfortable when things deviate. Or when you put them in a church.

Well, I'm here to tell you that good food comes in all sorts of shapes & colors & flavors. Of course, so does bad,  But the one thing I know is that . . .  it can't be both. 

Which review to believe?  None! Go try it for yourself!

So my vote is for 5 stars. I have never been disappointed in the food or the service . . . and by jove, the atmosphere is as close to heaven as you are going to get in a Brew Works!"
"PA","The beer is great. The service is sometimes good, sometimes not so much. The room is lovely. The food is meh. I've been here at least 4 times and the food has never been more than just adequate. I think the menu ideas  are interesting, but execution is generally a problem. The unique pierogies aren't very good. They don't even wrap them in pierogy dough, but rather wonton wrappers. I'm still waiting for Pittsburgh to prove themselves as the world capital of pierogies. 

Basically I wouldn't go here for dinner, but drinks and snacks. The brie with figs and port reduction goes well with beer."
"PA","One of the top 10 microbreweries in the US, and its a great place to go even IF beer isn't your thing.  All kinds of creative different kinds of pizza and Pittsburgh favorite dishes--all really tasty.  And the atmosphere is awesome.  It's such a gorgeous space to eat a meal."
"PA","I'm not a beer drinker, so I can't comment on the beer.  

Great conversational location with its being located in a church.  Really neat place to take someone from out of town.

I've never had anything other than their brick oven pizzas, which are excellent with the combinations available.  I also love the hot Gouda cheese dip with pita bread appetizer."
"PA","Water into Beer

On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there and Jesus and His disciples had also been invited to the wedding. When the beer was gone, Jesus' mother said to Him, ""They have no more beer."" ""Dear woman, why do you involve me,"" Jesus replied, ""My time has not yet come."" His mother said to the servants, ""Do whatever He tells you.""

Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind the Jews use for ceremonial washing, each holding from 20 to 30 gallons. Jesus said to the servants, ""Fill the jars with water,"" so they filled them to the brim. Then He said to them, ""Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.""

They did so and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into Beer. He did not realize where it had come from although the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside and said, ""Everyone brings out the India Pale Ale first and then the Pale Blue Ribbon after the guests have had too much to drink, but you have saved the best till now.""

This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He thus revealed His Glory and the disciples put their faith in Him. (John 2:1-11)"
"PA","Pierogi pizza is amazing!!!! They ran out of traditional pierogis which was a total bummer but then we saw the pizza. It was more satisfying than pierogis on a cold rainy night. The red leaf side salad was tasty but over dressed and didn't come with the blue cheese the menu promised. The special pierogis of the night were not amazing because the butter added in unwelcome sweet flavor to the jalapeño, cheddar bacon yumminess. The beer was great and the interior of the place is fun. A large brewing system sits on the alter and is  quite beautiful. The reason the place did not get 5 stars is because honestly out service sucked and the fact that they use styrofoam to go containers. The waiter did not greet us, tell us specials or attend to us. At one point when we were finished (napkins on plates) for a few minutes waiting for the check he was in the corner watching the game."
"PA","Great atmosphere but average food.  Coupled with the less than stellar neighborhood and this was a once and done for me."
"PA","The ambiance is better than the food or beer and it is QUITE expensive. Seriously though, it is almost breathtaking when you walk in the door. A huge church renovated into a brewery/restaurant...what a sight! The altar is very impressive, full of giant beer tanks. The stained glass is beautiful and they even have a few of the confessional rooms used as storage behind the bar! Definitely worth stopping in for a drink, but there are much better places to get food.

We had the cheesy spinach dip as an appetizer and that was pretty good, although a small serving. I was very excited for the brisket...which turned out to be under-cooked and very rubbery. I didn't even eat half of it. I was able to sample some platters that others with me ordered. I was impressed with the Buffalo Meatloaf. The Pierogie entree was very good but was almost $20! 

The best part of our dinner was our server, Ally. She was pleasant, energetic and patient with our indecisive party of 8. She was very knowledgeable about the different types of beers and made great suggestions for our table.

As far as the beer goes, Thunderhop and Unholy Matrimony are pretty good...Not sure if they have a happy hour, but if they do, that would be a great time to sample their beers, take in the sights and then head somewhere else for dinner."
"PA","I can drink beer in church!?!?! That is the appeal of Church Works, drinking in a church converted into a brewery. The pierogis.....delicious. That is what I want to eat every damn day. I was pretty bummed the coconut beer was not available and instead tried the licorice flavored stout (sorry, poor memory and I can't remember what it was called). I wasn't too fond of it and my sadness over the coconut beer was probably pouring into the beer. My gf and I snacked and only had the pierogi, side salad, and beers but we mostly went to say we drank beer in church.

And there are PEWS in the ladies's restroom!"
"PA","We have been going to Church Brew Works, probably since they opened off and on for years.  The beer has always been good, as well as the food.  I always get excited for Oktoberfest and the Wiener Schnitzel Holstein.  Could not wait to get there again this year.

Sorry to say, the cutlet was thick, and overcooked in the deep fryer as were the potato pancakes.  My husband and I still looked forward to the bread pudding for dessert.  It was as dry as the desert!  The waiter was kind enough to take the bread pudding off the bill, but when my husband handed him a $20 and asked for change, he thanked him, did an about face and walked off with a more than generous tip that was not deserved.

Needless to say, this place has turned into a tourist trap that we will never again return.  There are plenty of good food and beer establishments in the area, with much better service."
"PA","Once we got over the fact that we were in a church-turned-brewery... the whole gimmick faded and we realized that this was a pretty sub-par restaurant.

First off, this two star rating is due to the food and service. I hesitated giving it a 3-star because the beers were pretty good. But we're in Pittsburgh and by default, good beers are expected.

- The waiter our group got was seriously one of the worst waiters I have ever gotten. The moment we sat down, our waiter came over and asked if we wanted anything to drink in a tone of ""I do not want to be here."" We asked if he could have a moment to look at the menu because it was our first time and asked for one more menu. He walked over to a table with a cute couple and took the menu right off their table and gave it to me without asking the other couple if they were done with it. He then stormed off and didn't come back till way later. When we were ordering food, he gave us attitude for everything and was extremely rude. My friend asked a question and he answered with a sarcastic remark and walked to the next person, never bothering to actually wait or answer the question honestly. When we got our checks, he threw them onto our table. I was extremely annoyed by his attitude towards us, which started before we even spoke to him. I understand that you have bad days and just don't want to deal with anyone, but that is no way to act to someone who is trying their best not to anger you and now completely confused as to why you are treating them like crap. Anywho... rant over. Bleh.

- The pizza was alright. A little dry and not super unique. I felt like it was missing something in flavor. The portions were huge, however.

- I got two beers, the Rotating Stout (which is actually a light beer brewed with coffee and chocolate) and the Dunkel. The Rotating Stout was certainly unique, it didn't have the heavy, silky finish of real stouts, but had it's own unique, refreshing tart with aftertastes of coffee. The Dunkel was smooth and not super strong, again, a good beer to drink. Both beers were great and decently priced, but I would not come back just for the beers when there are other great beer places in Pittsburgh.

The only reason why I would come back is if I had run out of things to show visiting friends or they saw this on a flyer and HAD to see it. Otherwise, there are so many other unique, amazing things in Pittsburgh that I would love to show friends and family.

So luckily, I was in good company because the experience here would've been absolutely miserable."
"PA","i don't doubt that many people have bad experiences at this restaurant, because I can see how a lot of the food is overpriced the hosting station seemed to be a little lackluster.  My experience went quite smoothly however.  I went with four people, after our slightly confused looking hostess found us a seat, we were provided with great service.  The service was intelligent, but in a very scripted manner.  The beer was good, great compared to american craft and decent compared to european breweries.  The building is a lot of fun, huge renovated church with shiny stainless steel fermenting silos covering the side wall and the altar.  I chose the special for the night, which was rib-eye finished in the wood burning oven and a cranberry chutney.  It was good, charred on the outside, not overdone and a good cut of meat to begin with.  The prices are high for what you get though, meaning I wasn't stuffed after my meal.  Main Pro: Good local beer
Main Con: The smell of the bar, not the fermentation, was fairly strong."
"PA","A brewery that used to be a church? Does it get any better than this? They brew the beer right where the altar was. It's pretty neat inside. Still churchy, stained glass windows, etc. Once or twice when I went it was a little humid and smelled a little...funky, but it IS a brewery. It's nothing overwhelming that made me have to leave though. To be honest I don't care for their beer too much, it's more of the idea of this place that I love. But the food IS good, I'll give them that.  I would try to go for lunch instead of dinner, because the prices are much higher after 4pm. It's definitely worth trying."
"PA","The location would sell the place even if the food and beer were only OK.  The former church is an amazing place to visit in its own right.

Fortunately, the beer and food stand up equally well and made for a tremendously enjoyable evening.

We were in town for a pre-Christmas get away and went to CBW for dinner on a Wednesday night.

We feared the worst when we pulled into the side street and the their lot to see it quite full and figured that were in for a wait inside.  Thankfully, our concerns were unfounded as the place was busy but not crowded.

We sat on the ""pub"" side to the left of the aisle.  Our server arrived promptly with drink menus and quickly gave excellent descriptions of all of their seasonal beers.  I go to a lot of brewery restaurants and one of my biggest peeves are servers who have no clue about the product that they are trying to sell.  It was a pleasure to hear someone enthusiastically describe their beers.

I settled on the Mexican Mole Stout.  It was peppery and complex yet really balanced and enjoyable.  It didn't feel ""contrived"" like many infused beers.  After that, I went on to the barleywine ad have to say it was excellent as well with lots of alcohol warmth, complex malt tastes and very nice notes of the bourbon aging.

My wife enjoyed the SteamHammer very much.

As an appetizer, we couldn't turn down the fired risotto balls.  They were a wonderful treat and I'm going to try to replicate this recipe.

For dinner we settled on the portabello mushroom pizza and it was equally good and adequately portioned.

Highly recommended restaurant."
"PA","Restaurant/brewery in an old church you say? I'm intrigued.

Church Brew Works gives you some really good food in a cool atmosphere. I'm not a drinker so I can't report on the brews. Had a pasta dish with shrimp. It was very good. I think all of us really liked our dishes except for maybe the couscous salad. Didn't try the pizza but some of those looked really good.

We had to wait about 30-45 minutes for a seat but in part because we didn't mind waiting and didn't feel like hovering in the half of the restaurant with open seating. They take reservations for groups of 8 or larger. Prices are a little on the higher end, but so is the food. Main dishes are in the 15-25 range but they are filling and taste great. Good, knowledgeable servers.

My only real complaint, the very poorly marked front entrance. FYI, it is the center door at the front of the church, which seems logical but when you are there, it is not easy to tell."
"PA","I was here for the first time this past week while visiting Pittsburgh. What an amazing idea-a brewery/restaurant to a huge old church. The place is so big, just viewing is an experience. The beer and food are very good. My family had a really nice lunch and would definitely go back."
"PA","Had not been to CBW in years,  Some old friends were back in Pgh and eager to visit as they are beer fanatics.  I'm not a beer guy -- scotch is my drink -- so I didn't go for the beers.  I was there for the food.

The pro:  
 - Service is good.  Attentive, prompt, friendly and very competent.  Even on a VERY crowded Saturday night when the place was absolutely packed. 

The con:
 - Bland and poorly done food.  The soup was tasteless.  The bison rib-eye was all gristle.  Wilted lettuce on the salad and if there was ANY dressing on it, I couldn't taste it.  The fries were typical dive-bar fare.  The only exception were the two pizzas at our table.  Both were very good.  

So I guess if you're looking for great beer and tasty pizza, this is your place.  If you want good food, done well, head somewhere else.

HINT:  We had a reservation but were told that we'd have to wait about 30 minutes ""until our table was ready.""  We saw a bunch of empty tables in the bar area and asked if we could wait there and have a drink (or three).  When the server arrived, she said that we could order from the full menu in the ""bar.""  So if you're stopping by and the ""dining room"" is packed, head to the bar and have dinner there.  No difference!"
"PA","I LOVE CHURCH! I heard a lot of good things about this brewery. Granted that I am not a beer drinker, i decided to check it out since the food critics on here made it seem good. I'm happy that I listened. The decor is kind of shocking because it is a church indeed w/ beer everywhere BUT once you try the food, all of that goes out the window. One word: AMAZING! Church is a place that is cool to hang out on a Weekend night w/ friends to just kick back & relax. I will definitely be a returning customer."
"PA","I have only eaten here once.  I loved it.  I had a spicy artichoke pasta.  It was a vegetarian dish.  I have been meaning to go back, I love the atmosphere"
"PA","Great food, great beer ... and in a church.  

Loved this place."
"PA","Truly bad food.  I hear the pizza might be edible.  Atmosphere is cool, though, no kidding.  Maybe go for beers."
"PA","The atmosphere is wonderful...I mean, where else are you going to see beer brewing on an altar, and a bar in the confessionals? The perogies are awesome, and that's high praise from someone from the south who didn't even know what a perogie was till a few months ago."
"PA","Holy crap people....this is a brewery in a church.  Like literally a church.  They still have the basin for the holy water in the vestibule.  The pizza was fine and the buffalo tenders were decent.  And to be honest, I've had better been in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  

BUT THE BREW TANKS ARE ON THE ALTER, FOR CHRISSAKES.  This place could serve dog crap, and it would rate 5 stars just for the ability to tell your wife you're going to church on Sunday and not be lying.  

They don't try that hard with the service, but then again they don't have to.  If you still have questions about why this place is cool, you must have lived in a home with a lot of lead-based paint.  

God wants you to drink here."
"PA","This is a great place to bring visitors from out of town.  The ambiance is most excellent and the food is not too bad.  

I like the lunch menu better than the dinner menu.  Lunch is a bit more affordable and they usually have some interesting specials on the menu. 

I'm not much of a beer connoisseur, so I can't review that end.  However, I am surprised that they do not have bigger tv's in the bar area.  I was once there during a Steelers game and could hardly see the screen from the dining room!

They also have a few good vegetarian options as well, with a more vegetarian friendly lunch menu than dinner."
"PA","Shitty.  I stopped by at midnight on a Saturday and was surprised to find an almost empty church.  Although technically open till 1am, our server made it pretty clear that they did not want to deal with customers anymore.  We ordered a beer each, all of which were pretty good but not exceptional.  Overall we felt very unwelcome, and were appalled at the rude service.  Maybe it was just a bad night, but I was far from impressed."
"PA","Its an Interesting location. The food was quite average. the service was good and friendly. They also had their own brew. I tried the sampler and I thought the stout sucked.

Its an ok place."
"PA","The beer is great.  The location is amazing.  The atmosphere is the best around.  There are huge, shiny, copper beer casks on the altar, as if to offer their delicious beer to the gods.   Or something. 
The pierogies are delicious.  The rest of the food is hit or miss, but when it hits it is great.
And of course, it's a brewpub in a church, which makes it memorable, hilarious, and fun."
"PA","On a recent trip to Pittsburgh this was the first place my friends took me, and I loved it!  It really gave me an awesome first impression of how unique and interesting the 'Burgh really is.

The Church Brew Works is actually an old church-- amazing!  The microbrewing equipment is right on the altar!  So irreverent, much to my delight!  We were seated in a section where I'm sure pews used to be, and had lovely views of the original stained-glass windows and open cathedral architecture.

The beer was really great-- I tried a dark wheat and an amber, both really excellent.  We had pirogies, which seem to be popular around the area, and they were really excellent.  I then moved onto a pasta dish with different veggies in a light tomato sauce which was really great too.

Definitely check this place out!  And Pittsburgh natives, bring your friends here when they come to town!!"
"PA","This place is simply amazing. Our party of five ate on the pub side since there was a longer wait for the fancy side. We feasted on puffy pierogies, meaty wings and such fantastic pizza. For a drink, I had a soda (I believe it was brewed there) with vodka which was a good choice for me since I don't drink beer. This place is a bit pricey, but you've got to think about the costs that you rack up when you set up shop IN A CHURCH! Super Holy Hell, I will definitely come back to this place the next time I'm in PGH! I was actually bummed that Zachary wasn't with me because this place would have blown him away!"
"PA","Summer of '02. I don't know if it was planned but Al Roker's Microbrewery special was filming there. I was eating and drinking and the film crew stopped by and asked me a question. ""How does it feel to drink in a church"" and I replied ""I'm not religious so it doesn't bother me"". National TV and I couldn't think of anything clever. Looking back I should've said ""god wants you to get wasted"", which still isn't clever.

I was on TV one other time at a beer event in Chicago. They asked me how I was and I yelled ""I love Germans!"" It was a german beer festival."
"PA","I'm from Seattle so I know good beer and Church Brew Works has great beer. Food was really good too and the atmosphere is aweseome."
"PA","This one rates pretty high on my list.....

It has some of the best atmosphere of all time.  Yeah, there are huge beer vats where the alter and crucifix used to be.  The holy water is still there.  You can dine in a pew.  The bar is set up right outside the confessional (remind me to throw in another Act of Contrition, it's only been about 10 years since my last confession).  AND if that's not enough, the beer is actually tasty and the food is surprisingly much more creative than the usual pub fare.  They even throw in a couple of Burgh favorites, like the pierogie.  

I really want to go back, but don't have many reasons to venture to Pittsburgh......."
"PA","I give it 3 stars, but my husband (the craft brew expert) loves this place.  In fact; we usually entertain out of town guests here.  

The building is beautiful and it smells like brewing beer.  I just wish the menu lived up to everything else.  The food is good, but that's it.  Just good.  The beer is great and it's a quirky unique place.  Defiantly worth checking out."
"PA","A brewery in a church?  Interesting and unique for sure. I first heard about this place two years ago during my residency interviews.  Two years later I made the visit, on my first night of what will be at least four years in Pittsburgh.  So how did my first visit go?

Food (5.0/10) = Before I moved here, I did some research on foods unique to Pittsburgh.  One of the items that kept popping up were the pierogis.  As such, I was excited to order pierogis as my first dish in this city.  So what exactly did I get.  Hmmm.  I saw four pillow-like objects that looked like Chinese dumplings, but a little larger.  They sat in a pool of butter, and topped with a big ass dollop of sour cream.  Hmm, ok....so now to find out what juiciness awaits on the inside.  Mashed potatos?  Wait a second...what the hell is this? A blob of fat laying on top of carbs stuffed with more carbs, all swimming in a pool of fat?  My attention was then redirected to my friend who had just ordered the pierogi pizza.  Using my imagination, I visualized a thick crust pie with chunks of dough and mashed potatoes as toppings.  I was almost correct.  It was essentially a mashed potato pizza.  Now this concept is great if executed properly.  In fact, a pizza joint in New Haven, CT called Bar pretty much perfected this (Bacon, mashed potato thin crust pizza).  However, the pierogi pizza fell flat.  Just carbs on more carbs.    I also ordered what I thought would be a turkey breast sandwich.  I received grocery store deli turkey meat (the slimy processed kind that swims in sodium nitrite preservative inside a plastic container) in between two dry pieces of bread.  And this sandwich costs $9-10?  Where's the actual real turkey breast I thought I paid for?  Needless to say, the food was a big disappointment.  

The only thing that I can say positive things about is the beer.  Great beer selection.  Hell, it's a ""brewery,"" so better get the beer right, right?

Ambiance (8.0/10) = Certainly a unique set up.  Beer everywhere. Stained glass.  You can pray to the beer gods here.

Service (8.0/10) = Our waitress was great.  Allowed me to sample several of their beers before selecting one.   Was attentive.

Overall Opinion = A cool place to check out at least once.  Beer is good.  Food is meh.  $9-10 for a crappy sandwich worth about $1,...hell no.  No amen to that abomination."
"PA","Heard about this place for a while, and finally got the chance to check it out.  The atmosphere of the Church is very fun.  It's like a German beer garden.  We went on a sat and it was fun and loud. 

They have about 7-10 different beers to try. It's all open so all the beer tanks are inside the main seating.

No comment on the food though .

It's a really cool addition to Pittsburgh."
"PA","So good! Great food, beer, and atmosphere. The wild boar quesadilla was amazing...I wanted more! We also ordered the beer sampler. It gives you enough to try all the beers and share. The building is beautiful. It's a great space and all the brewing equipment is right in the main area.  Lots to see. Had a great time!"
"PA","The beer was good. The atmosphere was quite unique but rambunctious servers and a stressed staff added to a very live environment. It also didn't help that there was no music. It sounded like a cafeteria. Staff didn't take time to actually talk about the beer and seemed it just run around in circles. The food: PASS. Didn't opt for the pizza, but the cheesesteak was awful. My opinion, go for a quick drink, and get out."
"PA","Pierogies and Sweet potato fries, awesome. Beer, good. Flight was good to order with nice sized portions. Location is original and a must visit while in Pitts."
"PA","Awesome place to put a brewery. We were lucky that our hotel's shuttle would take us there and pick us up, because getting a cab on a Saturday is, apparently, impossible.

Food was... Meh. Beer was decent (I didn't love most of them). Service was also OK. She wasn't wonderful, but she was fairly attentive."
"PA","I don't know who these people are goofing and gawing over this brew house. While the church interior is impressive that is where the wonder ends. 

Not a beer person myself so I ordered a sangria which they were out of so had the bartender made me a mixed drink. My first mistake. It was overly sweet and had no alcohol very college style. 

We ordered the Belgium fries that turned out to be soggy hand cut fries that were not twice fried. The white aioli sauce (which should be yellow since it is made with egg yolks) was just mayonnaise that had been dumped with dill and salt  - in other words, it was terrible. 

We ordered the vegetable pizza which is a white pizza but no where is that mentioned the the menu. It was dry, dry as dust and flavorless. The crust was really good and would make good pretzels.

And now for the important part. My husband the beer snob was excited to try the beers! First the Coffee beer he thought was average and wouldn't drink again. The second was a Smokey Sour which was just lightly smokey and no sour. Disappointed with the brews he ordered a sample of Inside Out Stout which golden on color and was in no way a stout. Husband said all the beers were just weird and not in a good way.

He also didn't like that the beers were served with a LOT of foam/head.

We can't recommend this place, sad face. Maybe this place is fancy eats for college kids but our tastes have long matured."
"PA","Okay, it smells weird in here - musty church + beer brewing? But the atmosphere and the awesome beer and food make up for it.

Pierogies are awesome, the pierogie pizza is good (is it sacrilege that I want to add bacon or sausage to it?) The seven onion soup is heavenly as is the bread pudding.

As for the beer, I can only comment on the Millenium Trippel because once I had it, I did not want for anything else. It was that good. 

Minus a star for Pepsi products....(when I ask for a Coke, tell me you have Pepsi so I can change my order. I can tell.)"
"PA","For people into the basics here it is short n' sweet:

Location/Building: 5/5 Beautiful. Unique. Interesting. Very open and airy. A distinct smell of yeast and a mix of delicious food smells.

Service: 2.5/5 I'm horribly disappointed by our reservation not being a reservation at all and really rushing our meal which had originally intended to go from around 8pm - 10pm.

Food: 2/5 While it was not bad food by any means, for the price I could make entire meals with far more flavor. The portions were big, but even big portions of mediocre food isn't all that great.

Beer: 5/5 Outstanding. I will definitely be back for more beer, and maybe I'll allow the food another pass. 

The details:

I went to the Church Brew Works for the first time last night. I pass it twice a day 5 days a week and I've been curious for ages as to this fabled fine eatery and brew house within a church. I have to say though, maybe my expectations were too high. 

The entire point of going was for a friend's birthday gathering. An initial party of maybe 15. She had called days ahead and they said they could accommodate us. Upon arriving we were told it wasn't actually a ""reservation"" so much as a ""request."" Regardless of the fact that we had told them how many, what day, and the exact time DAYS in advance. After sitting for 15 minutes we down graded the party to 12 as some people hadn't shown. We grabbed some Pumpkin Stouts and waited another 30 minutes before downgrading to the 9 of us that had shown up and we still waited nearly 10 minutes more. 

Being under some time constraints this really put a damper on the evening. Although after the almost 50 minute wait we walked through the restaurant which is lovely with gorgeous high ceilings, a festive air, and a glass wall behind the altar through which you can see some of the brewing happening. We were seated on the altar which provides an amazing view of the entire restaurant. Our waiter was efficient, friendly, and apologetic for the wait. We had quick service and refills as often as we needed them. The food though, this is where I was really turned off from ever coming back for a meal. 

They have two menus; a regular and a pub menu. The regular is very pricey and the pub menu is moderate to somewhat pricey. We all ended up ordering from the pub menu and while the food tasted good I don't think it was worth the 8$ - 12$ a pop. At all."
"PA","Oh no.....this is now a fallen angel of a formerly heavenly restaurant.  Seraphim and cherubim must be weeping....what happened?!   This has always been my go-to spot for out of town friends....and was again last night.  Alas, it will be no more.  Service was spotty, the food was extremely disappointing....even the drinks were off.  Let me 'splain.

The Moscow Mule I confidently ordered wasn't even a glimmer of what one SHOULD be...not even a sprig of mint, let alone muddled mint.  Sigh.  Tasted like vodka (well, you couldn't actually taste it, WEAK drink!) and tonic with a sliver of lime....sheesh.  Where was the ginger beer?  They even make their own ginger beer...or maybe they don't anymore.  The Pittsburgh salad?  Come on.....the fries on top were fine, but the rubbery, melted mess of cheese covering SPROUTS (dear Lord, sprouts on a Pittsburgh salad?  Mon Dieu!).  The grilled shrimp were more like previously cooked, warmed up rubbery (again with the rubbery) things.  

At my recommendation, my companion had the buffalo meatloaf which was dried out on top of dry mashed potatoes.  I used to CRAVE the buffalo meatloaf, dream about the moist, mushroomy wonders of it.  No more.  Even the bread was just boring sliced Italian....what happened to the wonderful multi-grain bread they used to make?  

Apparently thiere is new management or a new kitchen staff.  Please, bring back the former glory that the angels used to spread their wings and sing over....until I see that sight over Lawrenceville, I won't be back.  So sad."
"PA","Pros: great food (love the un-traditional pirogies), great beer, great service, cool ambiance - it's not just housed in a church, but a pretty impressive-looking one if I do say so myself. My dad got a kick out of waiting in a pew to be seated.

Cons: no smoking in the pub area (although I understand not wanting to damage the church with prolonged cig exposure), and a bit pricey for the quality of fare. They try to straddle Pittsburgh food and NY sophistication to middling success.

I always bring out-of-town visitors here for dependably good food and beer with a bit more excitement than is found in most of Pittsburgh."
"PA","My favorite restaurant in the Burgh, this place has yet to let me down.

I love that they have a specials page in the menu, so I make it a point to order something from it every time I visit. From chanterelle soup (with a nice story about the owner picking the mushrooms himself), to the Octoberfest pizza, to the bolognese lasagna, to the special pierogis - nothing on this menu has disappointed me in the least. I like that this part of the menu goes along with the seasons as well, it keeps the food fresh and keeps me on my toes when searching for dinner.

On a special note, the pizza here is definitely underrated. The crust is fantastic and you can actually see the pizza station tucked away in a corner of the church, so you know exactly what work goes into making such a delectable dough delight.

Along with the food, the beer is good as well. One of my pet peeves is a brewery that makes a watery stout (see: rock bottom), and thankfully the beer at the Church meets my expectations. Their seasonal/rotating beers are a great way to switch things up as well, and I have found myself contemplating the finer points in life while enjoying many of their brews.

If you hate good food and good beer, the setting itself is worth a visit. On my first visit, I couldn't believe that this place is actually just a church that was renovated to a brewpub. Stained glass windows - check, pipe organ - check, pews for seating - check. This place has it all.

So go for the food, beer, and atmosphere, get one of the specials and a new beer, and leave happy."
"PA","Good Beer and Good Pirogies, what else could a connoisseur want? Having this all in an old church makes it that much better. Whenever I'm in da Burgh I make it a point to stop here. 

Just go there, you won't be disappointed."
"PA","umm, a beer hall in a church?

that's even better then a club in a church:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limelight

Interesting choices of beer, great pizza, and a decent menu of dinner choices."
"PA","not to be a pooper, but this place was not all it was cracked up to be. the ambiance is fantastic. i mean come one, a brew/pub in a church?? who wouldn't love that? (cept for those ... well you know...). the beer was good, but i thought the food was way too overpriced for what it was. maybe it was the nausea and lightheadedness from several days of long hours in a studio... but shoudln't that make food and beer extra tasty?

overall, i'm glad i didn't miss it, but i don't think i would ever go back."
"PA","Great place. Great atmosphere. Great beer. Okay, the food is good or very good, not great, but the pizza - Great. I never believed I would like a pizza with cheese and sauce only. No other toppings. Very strange for me, but I LOVE it here. The crust is exceptional. And remember, the other food is very good, also. Don't forget the outdoor dining area and the gorgeous bar. The wait staff has always been very friendly and helpful. All first time visitors should try the sampling of beers."
"PA","Restaurant/bar that used to be a church.  Mmm... sacrilicious.

miss l's review is right on - beer is pretty tasty, the spinach/cheese artichoke dip is great, i don't think i had anything else to eat.... i'm sure locals come here somewhat regularly but def. the kind of novelty place you're sure to find visitors esp. on weekends.  like me."
"PA","""When the moon hits your eye, like a big pizza pie""
the pizzas son delicioso!  The crust has a soft inside but a crispy outside. By far the best pizza I've ever had!"
"PA","If you're around stop by and have the wood fired pizza! I promise its the best pizza you will ever eat. And not to mention the fantastic atmosphere! It is such a beautiful building with original architecture still in place. Amazing!"
"PA","this place.

this place is just..  well its just awesome.

went there for the first time a couple weeks ago and i'm sorry that i'm just now writing this review, because i can't remember the name of the bartender, but let me tell you about what i DO remember - this guy was incredible.  he honestly made our experience unforgettable and because of him, we will most definitely be going back.  I didnt eat any food, but the 2 people i were with got pizzas, and they seemed to enjoy them.  then of course, there's the beer.  now, i'm not a huge beer drinker, but if i was, this place would be my go to.  sure there are other great places to grab a local (or not-so-local) beer, but how many of them are brewed and served inside of a church?  The inside of this place was incredible.  I loved how they kept the church feel to the building, but then, of course, there's all the beer.  

This place is just a really great, different kind of place to go grab a drink and some food, and, if your lucky, arguably the best bartender in PGH."
"PA","I've heard people talk of this place and thought to myself that I must go here one night.  The deal was sealed when my mom had told me she saw on national TV that it's one of the best places to eat in the Burgh.  She was salivating at the thought of a pirogi pizza.  So when my mom came down to cash in on her Mother's Day gift, my sister and I decided to bring her here to eat first.

There was ample parking behind the building so no need to worry about finding a spot on the street.  Walking in, being that this restaurant is located in a old church, you feel as if there is a spiritual awakening about to happen.  And there is one about to happen.

When you enter, make your seating selection wisely.  You can either sit by the bar, or in their 'dining area.'  Depending on what side you sit is the type of menu you are handed.  We chose the dining are and because we were thinking about the pizzas, we had to ask for the bar menu, even if it was just to look.  Also, don't forget to check out the board on your way in to check out the specials and what the untraditional pirogi are for the day.

After looking over the menu, we opted not to have a pizza because we were afraid it wouldn't hold up in the car after we left here.  My mom chose the traditional pirogi with the homemade chips.  Sister decided on Yinzer Cheesesteak with fresh cut fries.  And I couldn't pass up the untraditional pirogi for the day: asparagus and cream cheese.  I also got a side of Belgian fries with lemon caper aioli.  These pirogi were amazing.  I was a bit worried at first when I saw the mixture, but totally surprise by how good the combo worked.  The Belgian fries hit the spot as well, the dip was a nice sweet combo.  My mom loved her traditional perigees and had so much of the chips left over they went home with her.  My sister's Yinzer cheesesteak looked good.  It's just a cheesesteak...Pittsburgh style, i.e. read that as a cheesesteak with fries and cole slaw on it.

The service was top notch here too.  The server knew every answer and was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.  The hostess when we walked in and I asked a question about the untraditional pirogi did not know the answer but told me if I did get them, let her know how they tasted so she could pass it on to other customers.

Everything in here is interesting to look at.  While we waited for our food, we just looked around a lot.  Each of us pointing at various items throughout the building.  Even the bathrooms were nifty.

I, however, cannot speak of the brews.  As I was driving, but I'm sure I will be back to partake in one or more."
"PA","Nice location for a brewery.  Everything was good: the beer, perogies and pulled pork tacos.  The ambiance is what makes his place special.  I will be back to try more of their seasonal brews!"
"PA","Visiting from Milford, Ohio.  My husband was very excited about checking out this place.  WOW!  Beautiful!!  I took a ton of pictures, loved reading about the place.  I'm not a beer drinker but my hubby says the IPA was good; the others he tasted were not as memerable. I felt like the food prices were too high.   The experience was great:)"
"PA","A very good brewpub. Unique and beautiful setting and tasty, interesting beer. Food is hit or miss. I had excellent onion soup and good pizza. Fries were a bit soggy, and the server was okay but not great, getting confused about what we had ordered a couple of times. Overall, very good, though!"
"PA","Started off date night with a stop at the Church. My husband and I hadn't been there for awhile and were really interested in the seasonal and specialty brews. The bartender was able to provide a flight of most of them, which was not standard - very appreciated. 

The beers were unique, but not awesome, and one of them came in a glass that hadn't been rinsed thoroughly; it tasted like dishwasher soap. We both know beer, and this wasn't right. It wasn't some kind of cilantro beer or anything.

We ordered the homemade chips, which were delightful, before setting off to the next destination."
"PA","What a gorgeous place. We chose to eat on the patio out back, which was a good call due to the slightly-loud interior. Such a lovely and unique dining spot, with great food and an awesome beer menu. 

I loved my super-fat salad, with fries, melted Jack cheese and buffalo chicken tenders on it; my favourite when-in-America dish, indulgent and tasty, with two buckets of dressing on the side. The perogies were pretty nice, well-filled and solid. I also really liked the spinach dip with smoked Gouda, as a shared appetizer. 

Note that this place is out in the middle of nowhere, relatively, so plan ahead; we waited for a cab for quite some time."
"PA","Personally, Church Brew is one of those places I never venture myself, but I always take visiting company to...  I mean, it's a brewery...  in a church, and a beautiful one at that.

Relative to beer, Church took a major hit when its head brewery ran down the street to open his own gig (on my list of beers to try!).  Thus far, it seems like the quality of their brews hasn't been majorly affected, but CBW is one of those places that I either absolutely love or absolutely hate their beer.  A monthly rotating ""blast furnace stout"" (different flavors/methods of brewing) always presents an interesting drink, and their Cherry Quadzilla is good if you like fruity interpretations of Belgians.  Thunderhop IPA is that staple of the bunch, and a good representation of the type at that.

Relative to food, Church is generally also hit or miss here too.  Most of their food is average, however their pizza (particularly the wild boar) is extremely good (just be prepared to wait an hour plus if the oven gets backed up).

Overall, I'll give Church the nod as it truly is a unique gem to the city (one that's gotten a lot of national attention, including Brewpub of the Year), but it falls short of a five considering its roughness around the edges and a lack of consistency."
"PA","I cannot speak to the food here, but drinking beer in a church seems so wrong and so right at the same time.

We sampled 3 or 4 of the beers brewed in house and they were all wonderful. One of the Belgian Style Ales (I forget the name) was absolutely delicious.

Along the same lines as many other reviews the service left a bit to be desired. Oh Church Brew Works I wanted to give you 4 stars but servers that get salty because we aren't ordering food? Minus 1 star. I mean c'mon the name of the place has Brew in the name. Maybe we should've stayed sitting at the bar...

Regardless, an awesome place to check out simply for drinking beer in what used to be a church!"
"PA","Great brick open pizzas... my favorite is the southwest pizza

Great variety and taste of home brewed beers.

My friends had the filete mignon and the mat loaf and both were really good."
"PA","The building= 5 stars

Drinking beer at a church= seems a little blasphemous but a unique experience (4 stars)

Service= The waitress was NO help in explaining any dishes or what was popular, and we didnt have enough place settings at a large booth for only 4 people (2 stars)

Food= nothing special at all...maybe I should have waited the hour and a half for a pizza, but my stomach wasnt down for that.  I had jumbalaya, my sis had some sandwich, and we got perogies which were somewhat tasty (2.5 stars)

Beer= asked for a glass and gave me a pint...Just wanted to try it because I was at a brewery, and I didnt even finish it.  (2 stars)

Ambiance= had this weird, hoaky vibe to it that I couldn't quite explain. (3 stars)

Overall, the only thing this place has going for it is the fact that you can have beer in a church...and the building is historical."
"PA","Sorry, Church Brew, I'm just not that impressed.  You have the potential to be a seriously hip place, but you're just not there yet.

First off, I know you were a church at one point, but what's with the lingering old-lady-smell?  Not very appetizing...

Second, what's with the tattered menus?  I was kind of grossed out just touching the menu--it was old, stained and falling apart.  Unfortunately, it kind of made the contents look unappetizing, too.

Third, the beer was pretty tasty, but served lukewarm!  The sweet potato fries were served cold and limp!

The service was okay, but felt kind of like Applebee's service--not service you'd expect to find at a Pittsburgh ""establishment.""  

Step it up, Grandma."
"PA","First impression, quite an awesome building. 

I walked through the front doors of the church (flashbacks/guilt kicked in automatically) to a camera crew. Apparently the Food Network was filming some sort of show because of their pierogies (which is pretty cool).  It was a bit hectic inside so we decided to take advantage of the weather and sit in the courtyard. 

The outdoor courtyard was nice and cozy. I have been in better ones but I have definitely been in worse ones. 

Food: I got the a Mediterranean salad, although I was a bit hesitant because it was $16 with shrimp.  The old man was footing the bill so I went for it but was a bit underwhelmed when the salad came out.  For $16 I was excepting a Mediterranean island on my plate...but no. My sister got the pierogies which were decent.  They were a bit cold by the time I got to them which was my fault. My dad got a fish sandwich which was the best thing on the table. Crunchy, flakey, moist (eww) 

Drinks: Solid beer list but I opted for wine tonight. It was a chilly night so I went with red. One glass of Cab Sav and one glass of Zinfandel. Delish. 

Pros: Architecture, Great drink list, outdoor seating, nice but awkward waiter, changing specials

Cons: Strangely expensive for random items, cheesy plastic furniture on patio (really? you spend how much money on redoing the venue but you couldn't throw some wrought iron furniture into the mix), food took a bit but I think that was because of the Food Network event. 

Overall: Will go back. I think I will just get some apps and focus more on drinking my meal."
"PA","Such an interesting and mixed experience.  

Atmosphere: Very cool.  Your booth is a pew.  The interior is gorgeous.  Its awesome.

The Service: Quite underwhelming.  Waited a LONG time before we saw a server.  When he eventually showed up he was good, but he was obviously milking a big group for a big tip while we sat and waited.

The Food: Delicious pot pie, decent cheesesteak sandwich, underwhelming perogis.

The Beer: Had one great ""Fresh Hop"" ale and then one kind of lousy Pale Ale (weak carbonation).

I'm glad we went to enjoy the experience.  If service improves it would be an excellent destination."
"PA","I will start by saying we didn't have anything to eat. However, the beer was good and the atmosphere was incredibly unique. Worth a stop."
"PA","I went here to eat last week and it was beautiful,  The waitress/ bar tender was GREAT! 
Just curious has anyone noticed an awful smell?! I think its part of the brewing process but I really couldnt even eat it bothered me so much. Does anyone know if its liek that ll the time. There was a gentleman working on the alter so perhaps it was just bad timing? any input, id like to go back but scared ill be sick!? Food was good and beer was GREAT though."
"PA","Beer is off the charts good...food is average. Pizza crust doesn't hold up to the toppings and could be crisper. Pierogi very average didn't feel like homemade.  Atmosphere in bar really cool however dining area feels like a mess hall, church pews cool for booths! Great looking brew tanks!"
"PA","It's beautiful to walk into this brewery.  Total hipster concept, but lots of fun.  The beer, pizza, and dessert were phenomenal.  I am remiss that I did not purchase a case of the dunkel and bring it back to Baltimore.

I am deducting a star because the wait staff was not particularly friendly.  The hostess was nice, but the others seemed either rushed or inattentive."
"PA","My fish was excellent once it was cooked after being sent back twice.   I like sushi, but not when it is still transparent in the middle.   Little disappointed with the menu as well.  I guess had I gone only to drink I may have been happier"
"PA","I really loved the place.  When the hotel shuttle pulled up, bf didn't notice the sign on the corner and said ""Are you sure this is really a restaurant?""  It was busy inside, but we were able to get a seat at the long, winding bar. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but the bf makes up for that.  His favorite pour was the Xtreme Thunder Hops.  I took a taste and it was so hoppy, it felt like an assault on my tongue, but he likes that kind of thing. I had a glass of wine and the Cajun Risotto Fritters appetizer. Wow, they were great.  Altho I will say that considering they're just little fried rice balls...$8 for 5 or 6 of them is a little steep.  Due to the church interior, it can get very loud inside, with voices bouncing off all the walls.  I just loved the interior of the building. Just a gorgeous place. Our bartender was a sweetie and we met some nice people to talk to at the bar.  I'll definitely go back."
"PA","The interior is gorgeous; a high-ceilinged church with the stained glass and mason work in tact. However, the hummus was just average and both of our side order of fries were SO salty that it honestly made our mouths wrinkly like when you swim in the ocean for an hour; disgusting.

I had the pulled pork and it was dry, so either it was not slow cooked or it was slow cooked and sat as the juices evaporated around it.

It's a shame that such a cool building has such crappy food. Since it's a brewery I kept feeling like they should serve German delicacies but the menu is a hodge podge of pseudo pub food and not very good. A shame."
"PA","Fun place to go with a group, but go for the experience, not the food. The beer is pretty awesome usually - I love their Trippel and had a combo IPA/stout the other day that I liked too. Take away their growlers or 750ml are great values. 

Traditional pierogies are really yummy, and I get them every time. Also enjoyed the onion soup. Friends had pizzas but they're nothing pretty to look at and I didn't try them. I had the filet mignon because I was feeling extravagant, and for under $30 it might have been a steal. But the medium-rare I ordered was grey throughout (not that I was surprised, Pittsburgh consistently does not know how to make beer to order). Our waiter had absolutely no time for us, or I probably would have asked him to take it back or off the bill. All bitching aside, I enjoy going to this place, will go again, and will tell my friends to go. It's a necessary experience."
"PA","The quick rundown:

- Pretty decent selection of pretty decent beer. Nothing mindblowingly amazing, but above-average across the board, at about the price you would pay for an American macro elsewhere. 

- The pizza is quite good; other than that, everything is respectable but I don't know that I'd call it 'good.'

- Relaxed atmosphere, interesting setting.

- $13 filled growler is an absolute steal.

From a general food-centric standpoint, this rates at a 3.5. For people who enjoy beer greatly, this is closer to a 4."
"PA","Awesome place to go for a meal. The building is absolutely beautiful. The food was good. I only tried the traditional perogies and a regular pepperoni pizza. The pizza was delicious but I wasn't a big fan of the perogies. They were a little to bland for me."
"PA","Loved the atmosphere and the beer. Great place to meet up with friends and have some good beer and food!"
"PA","The staff here is super friendly.  The beer selection was really good too. The food was amazing! We sampled a little of everything but the onion soup was absolutely ridiculous good."
"PA","This place has a lot of unique food but let me tell you... Best pizza in the burgh. I accidently found this out last night. Little pricey but great historic landmark."
"PA","The place is excellent. Really well done inside.
Untraditional perrogies were very tasty as was the beet root salad.
The flight was well worth it and the sign up membership for 2 free glasses was worth it.
Would recommend for the experience. Some food like the burgers looked basic though although based on viewing only."
"PA","Love the beer and unique atmosphere. This really is a one of a kind place that I highly suggest coming to if you like beer. The building is an old church and declared a historic landmark. They brew a variety of beer here, which makes it a fun trip for a beer lover. Typically I think the food is good, however I never had a dish that I would specifically make the trip for. On my most recent visit the service was inconsistent however the waitress was very nice. If it gets pretty busy the noise can carry oddly and make it hard to hear. They have something on the menu for everyone but it can get pretty pricey for some items. I like that food items that have some Pittsburgh flair to them, which really adds to the experience. Also, the bar has seasonal cocktails and offers mixed drinks and wine in addition to their in house brews."
"PA","Neat concept but lacking in execution.  Wait staff seemed disinterested.  He seemed to want to be anywhere but here.  The food was ok and the beer was towards the low end of what I would expect from a brew pub.  This is definately a place to check out once for the unique concept of a brew pub in a church but is not somewhere I would return for a second visit."
"PA","I went here for lunch the other day. I had the shrimp etoufee, which was a little pricey for lunch at $13.50. I was hoping it was going to be a decent size portion, but it was on the smaller side. It was pretty good, but it was small and there wasn't much shrimp in it. I had a feeling it was going to be a smaller entree, so I went ahead and ordered a side of fries to get started. I should have asked first, but I didn't, and go figure, the fries are frozen (ie, not hand-cut). Personally, I feel, restaurants at this price range should be serving hand-cut fries standard. They do have Frank's hot sauce though, which is a plus always. I did not have any beer this day, so this review is only for the food. Service was decent, though I did have to ask for water a couple times before I got a refill at one point."
"PA","3 stars for the food and atmosphere.  Their beer sucks there is really no other way to say it- I just do not like it.  Since they brew their own you may want to try it I recommend the sampler so you can get a small taste of each beer.  Love the atmosphere and great for large parties. An old church turned into a brewery neat concept and great place to take out of town guests.  You can sit in the bar and order off the pub menu or the dining room which has a more upscale dining menu. I always ask for the pub menu as it has the pizzas and sandwiches on it.  Recommend the pizzas which they cook in their brick oven. You can't go wrong with the pierogi pizza and they also offer their homemade pierogis as an appetizer.  The pulled pork and turkey with brie sandwiches I also recommend."
"PA","We've only been to Pittsburgh twice and we've visited this place both times. I mean, a church converted into a brewery?! That's just awesome.

I greatly enjoyed sitting in a pew and drinking a beer, plus every beer I've tried has been great: the first time I visited I chose a red ale and the second time I tried their winter ale, plus I tried my partner's tripel belgian and our friend's IPA.

On our second visit I ordered a zucchini pasta dish, which was spiraled zucchini with mushroom and lentil falafel-like balls and tomato sauce, it was pretty good, but way too salty and they should seriously cut back on the amount of salt they use in that dish. If I were reviewing just my dish, I would give 3 stars, but since the concept is so cool and the beer is great, 4 is fair. We also ordered pita and hummus and that was delicious.

I'd definitely go back, but I wouldn't order the same meal again."

"PA","I give this 5 stars in every way. It's worth the trip just to see an honest to goodness cathedral converted to a beautiful brewery and restaurant. It is truly a marvel.

We were just in the city for one night (family of four from Philadelphia passing through on our way further west) and I am do glad we spent it here. We had: hummus, wings, buffalo burger, pulled pork taco, and pulled pork tostadas, and shaved asparagus salad (yes we were hungry and put kids are growing!) The only thing that was just ok was the hummus (it was fine but not great)--everything else was great. We also sampled: cherry quadzilla (very different and tasty) Kenya coffee pale ale (unexpected combo that worked). 

Service was friendly and attentive and knowledgable. Crowd was nice. Comfortable having a family there but not overrun by kids and families. 

Try this place!!"
"PA","We really, really enjoyed our lunch here. It was our first visit to Pittsburgh and our first meal in the area.  I've never actually had a Perogie but the Perogie Pizza was very good (and filling) with mashed potatoes, onions and cheddar.  When ordering something like that you just need to have a lot of trust in the restaurant and an open mind, and they really came through.  The pizza crust was excellent and I would be very interested to go back and taste a more ""normal"" pizza from there.  

The beers were also excellent.  We had the sour wheat beer and the brown ale.  If I could return I'd probably try the sampler, which looked very robust."
"PA","Fantastic setting.  Wonderful service.  Good food - but not great.

I've been here three times now, and the place is consistent.  It's a very satisfying place to be - great setting (albeit a bit loud due to the beer brewing setup), great people.  Good food (not divine but definitely tasty!) and the beer is pretty good quality - a tad watery.

Overall, though, I'll be back again, I'm sure, because it's just such a fantastic experience overall."
"PA","Darren took me here before I joined Yelp, and I liked it as much then as I did the other night. 

The Coconut Stout beer was scrumptious. 

Our server Megan was all-around awesome. 

I loved the Wild Boar Quesadillas and the Belgian Fries with that superyummy lemon-caper aioli.

My Chicken Madrid was excellent. The braised chicken came with sofrito, smoked pineapple, crispy polenta, and a salad of fennel, radish and celery. So good!!! 

Darren and I both shared the Chocolate Mousse Cake and the Malted Bread Pudding with malted chocolate ice cream, and they were each amazing. 

We never smelled anything funny. The interiors are huge and gorgeous and resemble a chatty dining hall.

If this place is a ""tourist trap"" (and I don't understand the debbie downer reviews it's been getting lately), I am trapped! I love Church Brew Works and recommend it a bunch."
"PA","For years...and I mean YEARS, I've heard of it, avoided it, and never had the least curiosity about it. It seemed like a waste of a ginormous building, and hype, hype, hype.  Plus, not being a beer drinker at ALL, the 'Brew' part certainly wasn't going to draw me in. But this past week, someone that I've been playing dueling restaurants with took me to Church Brew Works to see what it was all about.

Well, I guess it's pretty cool, if you're a tourist, a beer drinker, or don't mind busting a bank account on one meal.

The atmosphere is kind of cool in a kitschy way. Take a building once used to drain the soul, and turn it over to something that FEEDS the soul (or at least the liver). Not only is the enormous brew machinery on the altar a very cool replacement for bleeding martyrs, but it finally gives da burgh the centerpiece of worship that is befitting them. In addition to the apse-de-brew, all of the seating has been created from the old pews. Even the menus reflect old church programs.

Speaking of atmosphere and menus...I don't eat atmosphere, as I've pointed out in many other reviews. I ultimately go to an eatery to EAT. So after five minutes of taking in the 'atmosphere', I delved into the menu to make a selection.

I wasn't terribly impressed with the offerings, and I definitely was not impressed with the prices. If I end up planning my meal according to the menu prices, I've gone to the wrong place. And that is pretty much exactly what happened. We both chose a steak with cheesy potatoes and a corn salad, that was in the $15 range. My friend chose the 'beer sampler', which was like ten small glasses of beer that were supposed to be drunk in a specific order.  So our order was placed, and now on to sucking in more 'atmosphere'.

And I DO have to say that whoever places the orders for the wait studs in this place has impeccable taste in dark featured hunky real looking men. I was ready to take communion at any moment, or study up on what it means to be an altar boy.

Ok, atmosphere over, on to the food. The steak was cooked the way I liked it, and was very tender and flavorful. The cheesy potatoes, which I firmly believe are the leftovers from stuffing home made pierogis, was very pleasant and tasty as well. The corn salad, I could have used a few more words on the menu, or a heads up as to what all was in it, as onions are not my friend. I also think they could use a little better aim when putting it on the plate, or not use it as a sauce to top everything else on the plate, which seems to be what the aim was. I really didn't need the corn salad on the steak, or even dribbling over the potatoes. 

On the whole, except for the potential acid reflux from the surprise onions, the meal was satisfying and pretty good. 

Then came the dessert menu, and my friend opted for coconut cheesecake, and I had the tiramisu.  The tiramisu itself was great. My suggestion would be to drop the kind of fakey tasting chocolate poo blobs decorating the plate. They did nothing to enhance the flavor of the tiramisu, which would have been absolutely perfect by itself.

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, the meal was good, and my friend liked most of his beer (with ten of them, it's naturally going to be hit or miss). The atmosphere was pleasant and not TOO over the top 'sports bar' video screenage, and the eye candy just kept walking back and forth.

But once again, I am drawn back to the high pricing, which is what will prevent me from becoming a regular. I'm not even a fan of being treated when the prices are that high. And as I said...if I'm choosing my meal by price more than by desire...I'm in a FTLT situation.

I can see how the place would appeal to a tourist, or to a black and gold anniversary dinner.  But as a regular haunt...not so much."
"PA","Good beer. Decent food."
"PA","Let's just say this place was the first time I could say ""I'm going to Church!""  I love the whole concept of turning an old (and beautiful) church into a brewery!  The ceilings are so high and the whole floor plan is just open.  You can see every corner of the room and it's so inviting.  One tip a friend offered is to sit on the bar side to get beer specials and a cheaper menu.  

We actually had a fairly large group so it was impossible to find seating for all of us at the bar on a Friday night around 8:30 pm.  Instead, the hostess accommodated us with a long family style table in the corner and we were still able to order off the bar menu!  I started off with the Pious Monk Dunkel, which was an exceptionally smooth and tasty lager.  I followed up with a spiced ale, which was surprisingly pleasant and fitting to the season.  Many of us tried the Buffalo Burger, which they all raved about and made us all wish we had ordered the same.  Love this place and hope to return to try some more brews and the Buffalo Burger!

Note: there is also outdoor seating!"
"PA","This place is pretty amazing.   Big old Catholic church repurposed as a brew pub with vats where the alter was.  It ended up looking like an old german beer house with long benches for communal-esque enjoyment.  I Went with the pub menu, though they have quite an extensive regular, i guess, menu.  Buffalo burger was perfectly cooked, med rare, and tasty as can be.  Grabbed an excellent dark beer I don't recall the name of and I was happy as can be.  Hopefully I'll get a chance to venture back here and try some other fare next time I'm in Pitt."
"PA","LOVE THIS PLACE!!  We stop here every time we visit friends.  Awesome building with awesome food and beer.  I usually get the Steak salad.  I haven't found one any where else that comes close yet.  It may be the fries on top or the best ranch dressing around.  It could be the beer too!  The Pilsner is great.  Wish they had an amber but I'm not complaining.  We have also had the pizza which ask anyone...I am not a big pizza person, but it was very very good.  Brick oven pizza that is hot and delicious.  Hoping we get to sit outside this time.  Large private area with a hop garden.  Really cool place to stop and grab lunch or dinner!"
"PA","Just went back, still in awe of the place.  

Wanted to throw my vote behind the smoked gouda spinach dip.  Quite tasty."
"PA","I came here with a friend of mine while visiting Pittsburgh. 

We were driving down some street and I noticed this old church-style building with a big sign that read BREW WORKS outside. On a spur of the moment decision, my friend pulled the most illegal u-turn to pull into a side street while we went on a new adventure. 

Inside, I couldn't decide if I was walking into Sunday mass (this also happened to be a Sunday that we went) or if it was a restaurant. All of the original stained glass windows are still in place, and where the alter used to be is where they now have all of their beer. 

We sat at the bar and ordered a sampler platter of beer to try. It came on this cool place-mat with descriptions of each beer that we were drinking. The bartender was very nice and helped us with every question we could come up with. 

The food was alright. Better than average I would say. But it seems like you don't come here for the food so much as you do the setting and for their beer. It was an awesome experience that I wish I get to experience again the next time I am in PA. 

Plus, we got our picture taken for the local newspaper for a story on this place! Couldn't get any better than that! Definite recommendation in my book"
"PA","get sloshed in a.. church.  heck yeah!  whoever thought of putting a microbrewery in a church is a genius.. try the 5 spice beer.  food is not bad.  stay away from the pittsburg salad.  french fries on top of salad is not a good combination.  come on pittsburg.. u can come up with something better than that!"
"PA","This is one of my favorite places to eat and drink in Pittsburgh.  The beer is awesome and where else in the city can you get a good bison burger.  Oh yeah...it is housed in an old Catholic church which gives it a great atmosphere.  If you're in the 'Burgh, definitely check it out!"
"PA","Amazing!!! 

I must say I'm not big on beer so I wasn't very excited to go here for dinner.  Being new in town we were excited to try this place once we heard it used to be a church turned Brewery.  

We sat at the bar and got the best service ever! Our bartender ( I don't remember her name but she was tall, skinny with straight blonde hair) was AMAZING!!! She happily pointed out some of her favorites and helped us guide our way through their menu.  We ordered their 5 cheese pizza and added Spinach and Pepperoni.  It was so good! I can't eat to much tomato sauce things so it was nice that it was a garlic and olive oil base.  We also ordered their side Caesar which had homemade dressing.  Yum Yum!

My partner ordered their beer sampler and I got the Moscow (Something...damn it I forgot the rest of the name.) But it was vodka, ginger beer and a little lime.  It was so good I'm going to try and make it at home.  

All in all this place was yum yum good! And she even gave us some tips on places to go around town.  

Great place, Great service and yum yum food!! I'm going to be back sooner than I'd like to admit!"
"PA","Voted Pittsburgh's best eatery many years in a row. This old Roman Catholic church turned brewery/restaurant had great ales and specialty brews, an extensive wine list, a huge vodka selection and the best menu in western Pennsylvania. The brick oven pizzas are incredible with imaginative toppings.  Try a sampling of all the beers including the bottled fresh Thundergod IPA, and the Pius monk dunkle. All of the stained glass windows are intact and all of the tables and bar stools were fabricated from the church pews. The outdoor patio area reminds me of eating outdoors in Germany. One is completely surrounded by red brick ivy covered walls. I've had friends from New York, Vancouver, and Toronto visit Pittsburgh and I've taken them here for dinner and they all had a great time. They also have said that the Church Brew Works is a one of a kind place and only Pittsburgh could pull it off."
"PA","This is a pretty cool place!  The food was really good the service was ok.  We got flights but the server didn't know a whole lot about the beers....kinda important at a Brewery!!  She was polite..but you kind of expect a knowledgeable.  We bought a couple pint glasses to take to some friends..........and specifically asked if the one we were purchasing would come without the sponsor logo that was printed on the table glasses...and were assured that we would get glasses with just Church Brew Works logos...but, low and behold our serve grabbed and wrapped up to of the table glasses that has another business logo on them....she was kind to wrap them up..but we then didn't discover the mistake until we were home in Ohio.....we did call the rest. and they went out of their way to ship us two new glasses!!!!  That was VERY nice.   So, our experience was not bad by any means...and with a little more time, I'm sure our server has learned the details and is providing not only friendly service, but now is much more knowledgeable.    We definitely recommend you give it a try.  The Church atmosphere is awesome, fun and a great job at re purposing!!!"
"PA","Took our out of town family here over the Thanksgiving holidays and they enjoyed the atmosphere but the service left something to be desired.  Our waitress seemed a bit flighty/distracted and we thought it was due to the crowd but found out later that we were only one of two tables she had so not sure why she was struggling.  

It took a while for beers to be replenished and in one incident she said that they were replacing the tap for the IPA and when we followed-up with her about it when no beer arrived 15 minutes later, she said she would ask but then stopped herself and said that she remembered they ran out...What?!?!  I was thinking to myself at what point where you going to mention that and that's an important detail to remember when there's a table of thirsty individuals waiting for beers.  Needless to say, that's where the night ended.

For food, we ordered the ""featured"" pierogies which had a thousand island dressing with mushroom filling.  It was suprisingly good - I didn't think thousand island dressing on pierogies would be good but it worked.  Also ordered the spinach, feta, gouda dip with the ""oven-fired"" flatbread but was disappointed as the flatbread was cold and didn't seem ""oven-fired"" at all.  The dip was ""meh"" - not that great.  We also ordered the pesto mushroom pizza and four cheese pizza which were very tasty.  More than enough for 5 people to share."
"PA","This place is pretty awesome, as it's not every day you get to dine in a church...and that's what makes this place so unique. The atmosphere is just cool and so different from any other place, if you're a first-timer it's hard to pay attention to others at your table. 

The food actually isn't too shabby, either as the menu is very accommodating for varying palettes and even the gluten free. Plus, they have a more than adequate beer selection along with some good, mixed spirits as well. 

All in all, come for the atmosphere, bring some friends with you, and take in some good eats...with a few ""beverages"" to wash it all down in the house of the good Lord above!"
"PA","Way to create customer loyalty not taking a To Go order at 9:02pm when your kitchen closed at 9:00. Well done!

I love your food and I live in the neighborhood but will most likely start ordering take out from other places instead of CBW like I have been every other week for the past 6 months."
"PA","Beer was good but food was just ok.  Ordered the Gouda dip and paella.  Dip was luke warm and paella was over spiced."
"PA","I saw Church Brew Works on some sort of Buzzfeed-type list which coincided nicely with a visit to Pittsburgh happening a week later, and so I decided to give it a shot.  I figured the chances of me catching fire in a deconsecrated church were much lower than in a regular church, and there was beer. Check and check.

Overall?  Novel, but overrated.  Everything from the exterior of the building and the faux-billboard sign to the bar and brewing equipment in altar/sanctuary area inside the church is a bit of a head trip to see and experience, but once you get past the novelty of it all, the food and beer itself is pretty average.  A colleague I was visiting in Pittsburgh put it best by saying 'it's a place you only visit once, usually with friends from out of town'.  

A group of colleagues and I visited Church Brew Works on a Wednesday at 7pm, and the beer wasn't the only thing that was hopping here (it was pretty busy).  We were seated immediately (reservation), however it took us about 20+ minutes to get the first round of drinks after we ordered them.  I don't know what took so long - perhaps he had to climb all the way up to the belfry to fetch them? Regardless, instant strike one. They have about 15 beers to choose from - 25% seasonal and 75% fixed) and you can also order sampler flights of up to 8 beers. I sampled 4 or 5, and really didn't find any of them to be very impressive.  The rotating coffee stout I ordered was pretty boring, although I did enjoy the pale ale.  Unfortunately it took me another 20 minutes to get it after ordering.  Seriously, what's the deal with a brew pub not being on top of drink orders?  Strike two.  I will say that despite the delay, our server was very friendly and helpful.  

We ordered food, and I got the bison corn dogs (yum!) and the boar jambalaya (meh).  I've never eaten either meat, and I was happy for the opportunity.  The corn dogs were breaded and cooked perfectly, and came with honey mustard and ketchup condiments.  The jambalaya was not very impressive.  Actually, it was boring. It was more of a rice dish than an actual jambalaya, which was disappointing. My friend really liked the pierogies, and all of the desserts were well-received.  I liked the bread pudding that I sampled off of someone else's plate. 

The server split the check 10 ways for us without asking, so that was a nice plus. I found some of the dishes to be a bit overpriced for what they were, but perhaps you're also paying for the novelty of it all? (and maybe the heating bill for a church in late November).

I recommend visiting this place for the novelty, but a place with 'Brew Works' in the name needs to have better beer for me to give it a better review."
"PA","Beer was good
Food was decent but not extraordinary.

Converting a place of worship into a brewery is the best thing I can think of doing to a house of worship."
"PA","The beer has made a huge improvement! Try the coconut milk stout, it's amazing."
"PA","Always on my list of places to take people that are not from Pittsburgh.  The best things to get are beer and pizza (on the bar menu) for sure.  They have full dinners as well but they are a bit pricier and maybe it's just me but I feel like a trip to the Church Brew Works is not complete without the pizza!

The beer is also quite good.  They have a few that our always on tap and then do seasonal beers as well.

The coolest thing about this place of course is the fact that is it an old church.  You would not even know it was a restaurant if you happen to miss the sign in front (not on) the building.  They left almost everything as it was.  It still feels like you are in a church.  You still walk through the vestibule when you come in from the street and church benches are still used for seating.  Such a cool place, you have to see it."
"PA","I have been to Church Brew Works several times over the years, and must have never yelped about it. I have even lived within a few blocks of it for the past 3 years.

I will say this, it is not the Church Brew that I remember.

The beers are OK- from their usual rotation to whatever sort of seasonal they are churning out. I had the Millenium Trippel, and my girlfriend had the coconut stout. Both were reasonable.

Our appetites were slavering, having just circumnavigated the downtown looking for somewhere to park for the Jazz festival, yet leaving maligned due to the usual parking issues of downtown Pgh during an event. On the way back, we figured we had not been to Church Brew in a long time, so it would be just the ticket. 

They had an insert with southern/ creoleish dishes as the specials. This really got my tastebuds raring to go, as I love spicy southern food. To start, we had the alligator peirogies, and for entrees, the Cubano, and the Pulled Pork.

The peirogies were tasty enough, but I really did not get anything related to an alligator out of that. Hide I been blind, or blindfolded, I would have assumed they were regular peirogies with a bit of chutney on top. 

My girlfriends Cubano was a huge disappointment. This is the second time we have tried to get a Cuban Sammich somewhere and left thinking ""WTF"".  This sandwich is about 1) Well toasted bread 2) A good slathering of mustard 3) an evenly spread layer of crunchy pickle and 4) meat.

In that order. 

My pulled pork was flavorful, but no world beater by any stretch, and was paired with rice and beans minus anything to complement them in terms of flavors. Dont get me wrong, I think those ingredients go together, but some extra spices or textures would have made the dish superb."
"PA","If the prices weren't so high, I would have given this restaurant more stars.

The environment is beautiful.  Much like in churches of the time, you aren't sure where to look because there are so many beautiful features.

The menu is extremely unique with everything from run of the mill pastas to pizzas to alligator pierogies.  And the food we tried was great.  But the prices are quite high for the food you get, especially considering they are double most other brew pub restaurants in the area.

I ordered the pierogi pizza at the recommendation of several Yelpers.  I can see why it was pricey - it was HUGE.  I wish they had size options for the pizzas as this pizza could have easily served three people.  It is a good thing I loved the pizza as I'll be eating it for the next three meals.  My husband had the pasta in peanut sauce and thought it was very tasty.  Again, the portion was HUGE.    We had both ordered appetizers and would not have if we had known the food portions were so large.  

The french onion soup was fantastic but the wings were nothing to write home about.  I ordered the peanut sauce version and expected them to be tossed in the sauce.  Instead, I had plain wings with a side of the sauce delivered.  I did dip them, but tossing the wings adds to the flavor because some of it soaks in.  I'm not sure if all of their wings are served this way or just the peanut sauce ones, but it seemed strange.

We were originally hoping to try some dessert, but with the giant portions, we had no room left.

In all, an enjoyable experience with good beer, food and service, but a little to pricey to be more highly recommended."
"PA","A few familiy members were in town to see a Pirates day game and they had gone to the Church Brew Works last year and enjoyed it, so I joined them this year to grab a beer and small bite to eat before the game.  I hadn't been here in awhile since I had lived near Philly for the last 5 years, so I was looking forward to it.
     The atmosphere is unique because you're drinking in an old church and because of all of the tanks of brewing beer throughout.  Mmmmmmm.  I had 2 seasonal drafts, Lavender Summer Ale and Ambrosia Ale.  Both beers weren't what I would normally care for because they were light and floral tasting with citrus notes, but on that particular day it was about 91 outside and muggy and they both hit the spot. Not too heavy and very refreshing.                                             
      I ordered the Cajun Risotto Fritters for a quick bite and they were very good.  Crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside with chorizo and jack cheese.  They were served with Tabasco aioli which was a little spicy and just made me drink my beer a little quicker.  Not a bad thing.
     We sat at the bar and our bartender was very knowledgeable and pleasant.  The only negative about our visit was that the hardwood floor near the bar was very sticky.  I don't know why since they had just opened for the day. Maybe someone forgot to clean it, but it was just a minor annoyance."
"PA","When I lived in Iowa, I would come to Pittsburgh to visit my girlfriend. One of the first places we went out to eat was here. We got a pizza and a microbrew and both were simply amazing. I flew back home reminiscing about the perfect crust, the chewy and substantial cheese and the sauce which exploded with flavor. 

Since then, my girlfriend (now wife) have come back numerous times. Only problem: we can't remember what it was we ordered that first night. By now, we have tried virtually everything on the pizza menu, and all are very good--well above average--but we have yet to have a repeat of that first experience. Perhaps it was just the magic of budding romance that made everything taste so good. 

At any rate, we bring out of town friends here often since the space is so neat--high ceilings and pipe organs towering next to glossy stills. The beers are complex and classy--a must try."
"PA","We heard about this place from a fellow out of town conference attendee, and loved the idea of a brewery in a church a la McMenamin's Chapel Pub in Portland, Oregon, so we grabbed a cab and headed out.

The restaurant is indeed housed in a former catholic church and for that gets 2 stars. Seating options were outdoors or indoors; bar or restaurant. We selected the restaurant which we later learned has a separate menu from the bar seating. This is important, since the restaurant menu doesn't offer the pizzas which were pretty much the best thing there. I mean that in a good way, the pizzas are similar to the kind you might find in northern Italy, in fact it might have been the best pizza I've had outside of Italy. Also recommended: the spinach, feta and gouda dip. The menu was interesting and we enjoyed the bison and mushroom meatloaf, wings  and several types of perogies, but the dip and pizzas were the high points for us.

The beer was excellent. We ordered a sampler and then each had a pint of our favorite. The Dunkel was a winner as was the seasonal hopless Ambrosia. Really fine beers for all palates. While not cheap, the prices were reasonable for the quality of food and ambiance. Service was excellent, and in later conversation we tabbed our waiter Shawn, ""Porter Laureate"", for his artfully accurate descriptions of the various beers.

I would return here if the opportunity should ever arise."
"PA","If you aren't freaked out by the fact that this place realy is in a church, you'll have a good time.

I've been here several times over the years.  The beer is great and the atmosphere is fantastic.  The high ceilings in this place are the perfect antidote to the closed in and claustrophobic feelings that you get at most bars."
"PA","I had high expectations for this place as its a Pittsburgh legend as far as restaurants go.  I wans't necessarily let down, but I can't see what all the type was about.

The beer was good.  We got one German style beer and one American style brew with 3 types of hops.  Both were great.  We split the tuna appetizer (4 stars) and the black bean soup with cilantro sour cream (4 stars) and a salmon salad (4 stars). 

So why three stars?  Over priced for what you get - luckily we were not too hungry our we would have left craving more.  Also, the service was so so at best and the food took more time than usual.   I didn't really like the environment of the outdoor seating either. 

Overall, I would return but have mixed feelings about the reputation this place has been able to build for itself."
"PA","We just spent a weekend in Pittsburgh and heard from several people that we had to try the Church Brewery!  I'm glad we did.  We went with a good sized group (7 of us) and sat outside - initially.  We ordered a few beer samplers and hummus to start - hummus never came, but we didn't care b/c we also got the special perogies.  

Then - the rain came - the manager opened the fancy-shmancy awning....to no avail - the rain kept coming down harder.  Just as our server was bringing our entrees - we were making our way inside to avoid the deluge.  Fortunately we had no problem getting an inside table to enjoy our meals.

Our vegetarian friends weren't impressed at all with their meals (it's definitely more meat-friendly of a menu).  However, my partner and I shared:  appetizer perogie, crab cake entree, and a side of poblano mac and cheese.  We ate every last little nibble - and it was all fantastic.  

The beers were very good too!  All of this was just capped off by the beautiful architecture and decor within the old church.  Next time we're in Pittsburgh, we're definitely going back!"
"PA","This is somewhere you go once.

It's awesome that they've turned a church into a brewery. Throwing the kettles onto the altar: perfect. The beer itself is pretty decent; I'm a fan of the Pious Monk Dunkel especially.

The food is good, but not stellar. The biggest problem is that the menu that they had the last time I went (last month) is *the exact same menu they had when they opened.* Everything on there is good, but nothing on there will blow you away--and after you've been there a couple times and it's the same menu over and over again, you realize that this business is trading on the novelty factor, not making any effort to actually be a real restaurant. Very disappointing."
"PA","I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Church Brew Works. The collapse of the steel industry in Pittsburgh left quite a few parishes without a congregation and led to the creation of this very unique brewery. How often do you get do drink beer in a church? The fermentation tanks are literally at the alter. Something about the combination feels so wrong that it is right.

Apart from the atmosphere, the beer here is great stuff. Grab a sampler to try them all, each had its merit. It's looks like you can grab growlers and mini kegs as well. Certainly worth checking out."
"PA","Incredible venue for taking our guests visiting from out of town -- church turned brewery/restaurant.

Parking lot in back and on-street parking available.  Nice selection of brews plus other libations if you, as I, are not into beer.  Menu is very unique -- ostrich/boar/pizza/chili/pierogies  among the offerings.  I selected the pierogies with tomatoes and broccoli.  Definitely satisfied my taste buds.  

Bass and accordion players played and sang ""Happy Birthday"" to several patrons, while toasting their beers, as well.

It's a lively place that definitely still has the looks of a church with organ, stained glass windows, and pews abounding.

Bottom line -- it's fun and tasty.

P.S.  As of this post, scan QR code from table sign, sign up for email and get free glass. Sweet!"
"PA","Great prices, if you come early you're seated quickly. Good service. Awesome beer samplers. Perogies are yummy but the best was 7 onion soup, even the bread and butter. Live polka music right now!"
"PA","Hello Pittsburgh! The Catholic school girl in me has never been happier than at Church Brew Works. Seriously?! An old church turned brewery...ok, I'm in! 

Real talk, this place is bad. ass. From the outside I got nervous...""oh no, have I led my friends astray? Are we about to walk into mass? All this walking to explore a church"" alas, my fears were assuaged when my party walked into this little slice of heaven and everyone was ohhing and ahhing at its pure beauty. I mean literally, the altar is full of brewing beer! Check out my photos, the floor is still the original and the benches remain as seating options. 

Onto the food: hella good. We got the bbq pizza and oh mylanta. Hell yes. So good! And I don't even like bbq pizza!! It came out hot and delicious straight from the oven and it was everything you could ever want out of 'za.

The beer. Unfortunately this is the only reason for that last little star remaining blank...it was ok. Wasn't hop out of my seat and start cheering. BUT the names are all relics of the church life which was pretty sweet.

I'll be back next time I visit for certain!"
"PA","I've been to this pace a few times the food isnt bad, but I've never had anything so good that I would order it again.  I got the pork porterhouse dinner, the pork was over cooked not to tender, it came with two patotoe pancakes they were really good.  I did have  the white mango sangria to drink. So good I had two!  This place is really cool inside, because its in an old church, lots of people take pictures when they walk in. They get really busy here if you dont come earlier for dinner on weekend dont be surprised to have an hour wait!"
"PA","I couldn't try their beer when we went, so this is more of a review on their food and location.  It's different.  We were visiting and friend brought us here.  The food wasn't anything special (we had sandwiches) but the location was interesting.  Worth a visit. Seating was quick."
"PA","I think the environment is so creative and fun. The entire restaurant is made of wooden throne-like chairs and pews, and the altar has been turned into a mechanical brewery!

I've only been there a few times to take my visiting friends there and it's a fun experience for them. I'm not sure about my friends, but honestly, I can't say that I've ever had an amazing meal there. It's not terrible by any means, but I never leave thinking, ""I have to come back, like tomorrow."" However, the beer selection is it's highest point for sure. I have always been extremely satisfied with the different brews I try every time.

The service is good, and the employees have always been knowledgeable of their menu and beer selection, and have always been very speedy with their service. There is a somewhat limited parking lot behind the building. I've never had trouble getting a spot but on it's busiest nights it might be a hassle?

Overall, you must go at least once! But I probably won't be convincing myself to go anytime soon."
"PA","This restaurant would have rated 4 stars but for our Server. I've heard about Church Brew for some time and had not set out to eat here, but the restaurant we originally planned had closed. The setting is very nice. The food we had (pork tacos verdes and pierogie saute) was excellent. Unlike the station next to ours, Anthony did not explain the beer list, despite our question about a sampler offering we'd seen on the way to our table and questions about the beer selection. He did not take time with our questions and was inattentive after someone else delivered our food. He never refilled our drinks or offered refills or dessert. I noticed the table next to ours asked for a dessert menu and he delivered it without comment or highlighting and no order was placed. We are normally generous tippers, but Anthony got the minimum 15%. I write this for the purpose of constructive comment. All of this cost our Server and the restaurant money. The Server next to us, on the other hand (blonde/white-haired female) took time with each of the two tables we watched to go over the menu and specials in great detail and regularly followed up with her patrons for questions or refills, etc. She also brought the dessert menu and highlighted a couple items which resulted in an order. The food was excellent and although some light background music and a tad more light would have been nice, I will return with visitors, but Anthony needs a slight tune-up and he will be rewarded for his efforts."
"PA","Where can two babies and families go to eat a dinner without feeling like they're ruining everyone else's night?  Besides Applebee's.  

The casual but darn cool atmosphere of Church Brew Works was a pleasant surprise for us out-of-towners.  We couldn't stand the wait for the restaurant side but, turns out, the seat-yourself bar side had free tables, the same menu and table service.  Sweet!

I ordered the Pittsburgh salad - a salad with french fries which the natives said is a Pittsburgh thing.  It was tasty but not particularly interesting besides the fact that there were fries on it.  The cheese and potato perogies we ordered were yummy as well.  The service was very nice.

The food wasn't outstanding but it was a nice change from some chain restaurants and pretty good overall.  My friends and husband enjoyed the beer and I hear good things about the pizza.  We were there for a while and didn't feel any pressure to leave as long as we kept ordering a beer or two."
"PA","-What is there to say about this place...it's a brewery built inside of an old church. This place is HUGE! So much space and the bar itself is just massive.  Depending on the time of day, you may get a strong yeast smell which doesn't make everyone in your party happy.

-I got the sampler of course, not much to say all the beers were good none stood out as AMAZING.  I actually preferred their pale ale over their IPA. But the sampler is worth trying.

-The pizza is fantastic, I've been twice and both times enjoyed it very much.

-All in all if you are in the area check this place out, it's got good food, good beer and just the scenery is fantastic"
"PA","I came here for lunch and was rather disappointed with both the service and the food.

We were a large party of 8, but the restaurant was not very busy and service was still slow. The waitress had to be asked multiple times to bring napkins, etc.. and didn't really check in. Even getting the check and getting out was slow.

The food took a long time to come out. I had the pulled pork tacos and was very disappointed. They were SO greasy and didn't have a ton of flavor. I got the ""bottom of the barrel"" fries, which did not impress either.

I wanted to like this place, but would not recommend it based on my experience."
"PA","Love yourself enough not to drink here.

If you have to dine here, do yourself a favor and only order a pizza--the pizzas are actually quite excellent.

Why the single star review?  This place has EVERYTHING going for it, all the ingredients for an awesome restaurant are there, and yet the Church Brew Works still completely fails.  

Their beer is awful.  I know a thing or two about making beer and here it the thing:

You need to hire a brew master experienced enough to know WHEN beer is finished, and I can also tell that this beer is 'messed around with' too much during the brewing process.  get a better brew master, seriously.

NONE of these beers taste finished.  Not one.  At best, the IPA is kind of alright.  the rest of the beers just smell like urine, and they dont taste much better either.

oh--and the restaurant STINKS inside.  its the yeast they use for the beer, but it's off putting.

The last time I dined there, I ordered the meat loaf and it took forever to come to the table and when it did arrive, it was cold and it had sat so long in the kitchen that a skin had formed on the gravy.  Yuck.

our waiter was an asshole.  Very patronizing, to the point where I almost said something. 

I WANT to like this place.  I really do.  It's lovely inside and it always seems like its going to be great when you first walk in.  Every single time this place dissapoints me."
"PA","I LOVE this place!!!!
Had a buffalo burger...A little dry, prolly cause it's buffalo....
Maybe mix in something with a little fat to give it some much needed juiciness...
Still overall a great time!!!"
"PA","WOW!  Hidden gem of Pittsburgh.  This is an actual church turned brewery. If you like beer and good food, you need to get your rump-de in this place.  The aromas when you walk in are incredible."
"PA","If I could give 6 stars, I would. Tasted 8 of their 10 beers in a sampler and really enjoyed all of them, which is rare. Highlights were the winter Saison (which was not very saison-like- more of a vanilla winter ale) and stout which had a nice smoky flavor. Food was above par for a brewery with good local flavor. I tried the perogies which were great as well as a fairly basic but good turkey, Brie, and cranberry sandwich. Staff was very friendly.The highlight (apart from the beer) was the amazing setting- an old Roman Catholic Church. I am not much for church tourism (as a Jewish girl) but this one is well worth a visit. Formal confessionals now sell merchandise. This place is a must on your visit to Pittsburgh breweries."
"PA","This place is COOL.  The only micro-brewery located INSIDE a church in the country, according to their brochure.  We'd likely change religions if we lived in Pittsburgh.

$15 to sample 8 different beers, and they are generous 5-oz pours.  We went home with 2 growlers.  There's something for almost every taste."
"PA","This is an old church that was turned into a brewery.  I think people mostly go here to drink beer, but since we don't drink, we like to go here for the cool atmosphere & their pizza is pretty darn good."
"PA","After starting a new job about 2 weeks ago, my supervisor thought it would be a good idea to go out for a bite to eat and a few beers, as part of my introduction to Pittsburgh and as a way to build some rapport outside of the office.  He suggested the Church Brew Works as the venue, with the caveat that he has found their beers to be rather uneven, their food to be suitable, and the location to be quite remarkable.  I had heard about the Church Brew Works before, and I was eager to try out this restaurant.

My supervisor was correct when it comes to the beer.  I had a pint of the Heavenly Hefe Weizen, which I found to be rather mediocre.  It was a bit watery for my taste, and there was a flavor I couldn't pick out that seemed a bit off.  For our second round, we chose the Pipe Organ Pale Ale.  This brew had an assertive hoppy essence that was quite enjoyable.  It was pleasantly bitter, and definitely the better of the two beers that I tried.  Compared to other pale ales, though, it was simply OK.

We split the Chicken & Chorizo Pizza, which was quite good.  The crust acquired a nice flavor in the brick oven and was crispy.  Toppings were fresh, although I found the grilled chicken to be underseasoned and the chorizo to be a bit bland as well.  I was expecting a spicier sausage.  On the whole, though, the pizza was good.  It was the perfect amount of food for two strapping young men to share.  At $15.50, I thought the price was fair for the amount and quality of food.

The real star at the Church Brew Works is the building.  It is clearly a unique setting, and it was a lot of fun to enjoy a few beers at this location.  For a Wednesday evening, it was quite busy so they have clearly built up a following.  I would certainly return, in search of a better beer from their selection."
"PA","We were confused on where to enter because it was actually a church.  Its been a while since i had to call the place and ask where the front door was.  Even with the call, I was still confused.  So I went to the building that looked like a church, and went inside.  Then boom, beer flowing the rooftops...ok that's an imagination that I have.  We went down the middle aisle and seated half day the church.  There was beer filters, bars, tables, and tvs.  I wasn't sure if it was blasphemous or simply a restaurant that was renovated in a church.  That's exactly how it is.  Interesting and eerie with a twist of humor.  

I ordered the Cod Fish Sandwich which I imagined to be small for only $10.00.  The fish was a bit dry, mainly because I didn't  put any type of dressing on it, so that's my fault.  I don't drink beer...or try not to, so I can't really tell you about the beer.  My coworker liked it.  He had like 10 glasses.  Alki!

service is ok."
"PA","Just got back from Church Brew Works, as we had a pretty good experience. There were probably 40 people in the restaurant, but the sprawling size of the place makes it seem empty with that size crowd. It's a really cool space, between the brewing equipment and church relics, so there's a lot to look at and discuss. There's even lots of helpful info about the history of the place and beer brewing in the menu.

We started with the ""Nontraditional Pierogies"" (as opposed to the Traditional Pierogies) which change periodically; today they were stuffed with potato, chicken, andouille sausage, peppers, and pepper jack cheese (that I can remember) and DARN they were tasty, just needed a bit of salt though.

We also had fries with beer cheese. The fries themselves were okay, Potato Patch style but a little overdone. The beer cheese was pretty tasty as well.

For an entree we had the ""Cinco Formaggio"" (a name I find quite odd, since cinco is Spanish and formaggio is Italian...but I digress). The combination of cheeses plus pine nuts is mild and yet very yummy, the pine nuts add a nice crunch. The crust is heavenly, though I wish it had a teensy bit more salt and perhaps some butter or olive oil to moisten it a bit.

We also, of course, tried a couple beers, which were good in my book but I'm not by any means a beer connoisseur, so I can't do much describing other than to say I liked it.

Our server was very friendly and helpful -- checked on us enough times, refilled my water, all that good stuff. All in all we definitely enjoyed the meal and hope to come back for more soon!"
"PA","I give them an A on creativity and a C on execution. The hall seemed more like a cafeteria then a restaurant. There is little privacy and too much reverberation. The beer is really good which wins most of the stars. The pierogies..., let's just say that they were hard to finish. This is a great place for a tourist but not a local favorite."
"PA","Drinking beer in a church? This I had to experience. Several of my friends were also former alter boys and felt a bit of guilt, just for a minute ;)

From the outside it still maintains the facade of the former church, nothing changed except for a sign of restaurant's name, and even that has been made to fit with the church. When you do enter inside it really has an amazing ambiance. The stained glass has been kept and some of the pews as well. The large brewing casks against the wall and in the back fit well with the cavernous interior.

They had some great choices of their own beer and priced very reasonably considering the microbrew quality. I chose the stout which had chocolate tones with a bit of coconut, and no kidding the first sip I had made me think I was drinking a Mound's candy bar!

They had a choice of choosing from their dining menu or their bar menu. I chose the BBQ chicken slaw melt. It was a a good size chicken breast that was juicy topped with cole slaw, and melted provolone cheese, and bacon :) Yum!

It seemed everyone else enjoyed their meals as well, although the buffalo burger seemed a tad small.

Our server was great. He even brought individual checks for our group of 10.

Although it's not in the most convenient location it is well worth the trip to go out of your way to get here."
"PA","What a cool place! We were totally taken in by the gimmick of the brewery in a church. It's a gorgeous place and much more relaxing to visit for beer instead of prayer. We split a tasting flight and the beer was quite good. We also had a hummus plate which was not great, but hey, you win some you lose some. Overall, pretty sure God is smiling down on this place."
"PA","Great place to take out of town friends. Excellent happy hour specials & delicious pizzas. There was a period where service was a bit lacking (waiting over a hour for food) but things seem back to normal now. I've been coming here for over 10 years & overall the service is great and you can't beat the ambiance."
"PA","Church Brew Works is one of those places you go to just to say 'Hey I went to this brewery which is inside of a church!' Granted I didn't eat here, but it seems like traditional sort of fair. Me and the other half came to grab a beer and a martini. Good prices, nothing flashy. It was fun to take a look of the remnants of the past, but I don't think it would be a place I would come time and time again. It was a fun stop, and I recommend just to grab a drink and take a look in"
"PA","Church Brew Works provides a traditional beer hall atmosphere in a transformed church.  For a local craft brewery, Church Brew Works does offer some very tasty options on draft and what I would consider to be the best beer flight in Pittsburgh - in terms of tasting experience.  From a brewery standpoint, Church Brew Works certainly does not disappoint. 

From a food perspective, the brewery provides the standard pub options that would be expected.  There aren't many stand out options on the menu, but it is certainly not difficult to find something to hold over ones appetite between pints of the enjoyable craft beer.  The food selection leaves more to be desired, however, the food taste is pairs nicely with the beers on tap. This is certainly a location where the drink rules supreme and the food merely follows.  A great location for an evening out with friends or for private events."
"PA","Love love love this place! It's the go-to when my roommate and I have out-of-town guests or whenever we want non-Mexican food and alcohol for dinner on a Sunday night. (A surprisingly hard to find combination in Pittsburgh) The wait staff is always friendly and professional...they've let every group I've come with sample multiple beers and were very accommodating about special dietary needs or explaining the menu in greater depth. It's a good place to go with friends, as the pizzas are large enough to split and it's fun to get several of the delicious appetizers to share."
"PA","Visited this restaurant while in Pittsburgh for the day. Aside from the novelty of a brewery being in a church, the experience was not good. The service was incredibly slow and inattentive. I ordered a $20 ""speciality"" pizza (chicken & sun-dried tomatoes) and was extremely disappointed. It had no flavor. There was no sauce of any kind, the chicken wasn't seasoned, and the so-called sun dried tomatoes were dry and flavorless. After delivering the meals, the server never checked back. Our drinks were refilled as he handed out the checks. The only positive thing I have to say is the bread and garlic herb butter were tasty. Would never go back and quite frankly, wish I hadn't have gone in the first place."
"PA","Most overrated place in Pittsburgh, in my opinion. Their beer is nothing special. Neither is their food. And their service is routinely awful. If you're looking for a cool, unique Pittsburgh experience, I'd recommend Fat Heads or Hough's over this ANY day."
"PA","Love their beer!"
"PA","I get it, they have a really cool concept and it's a great tourist-y spot, but I have never really enjoyed a meal there. 

The inside of the church is beautiful but the ambience feels weird to me. They don't play music (at least not while I've been there) and it really throws me off because I feel like I can hear everyone and everyone can hear me because of the acoustics of the building. Also, I just think some background music is crucial while you're out to eat--it sets the mood! 

The service here is decent but it almost feels like a chain restaurant rather than a funky, local brewery. Last time I was there my server didn't know much about the beers, which I thought was weird. They do have good pizzas and the beer selection is good but I think everything is over-priced (probably due to the tourist-y factor.) 

I've taken people from out of town there twice, hoping to show them a good time at a fun local spot but was disappointed each time and wished I had gone somewhere else. It's not awful, but definitely doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion."
"PA","Hungry for a late-night bite to eat after visiting friends and their brand new baby, we headed to Church Brew Works.

I'm a little obsessed with old historic buildings repurposed for new causes.  While it probably started with the old firehouse converted into mansion circa The Real World: Boston, I've always liked the idea of living or working in a historic place.  Church Brew Works, as its name implies, is a brewpub in an old church.  You're definitely struck by the unique setting when you walk in.

While the beer is great, they're also noted for good food.  We were starving, so we started with the Bison Corn Dogs, served with honey mustard, pickled veggies, and a chipotle ketchup.  They felt like saltier, meatier versions of state fair corn dogs, and I liked the subtle kick from the ketchup.

My absolute favorite part of the visit was the brick-oven pizza.  We chose the Garden Plum Tomato Pizza, which had garden plum tomato sauce, basil, garlic, olive oil, and some really fresh mozzarella.  The whole pizza tasted super fresh, and the ratio of cheese and sauce was spot on.  My favorite part was the crust.  They are used some beautiful dough here, because it was pretty much my ideal consistency for pizza... chewy, with a fluffy crust!"
"PA","Didn't pick these guys - my home warranty company American Home Shield did. AHS has a history of sending very poor contractors and this was no exception. These guys were rude and unprofessional (they couldn't even close the door behind them and my cat almost got out several times). I submitted a ticket with three items. They claimed that all they had was one (but managed to check and see the 2nd issue wasn't covered???). They were very obviously looking to do as little work as possible. They were attempting to fix a light which was part of a ceiling fan assembly - in the process of fixing it, they discovered it had a feature that allowed it to operate with a remote control. They refused to fix it so that I could order a remote to operate it. As a new home owner who didn't get a remote when I moved in, how was I supposed to know it was remote control??? They demanded that I produce the remote control if I wanted that portion fixed, and without it they chose to bypass the capability and rip out the remote receiver. They told me if I wanted it fixed I would have to place another service call through the warranty company and pay another $60 deductible. Nice to know this trip cost me $60 and lost functionality of my light/fan.

Perhaps they were only operating under the guidelines that AHS sets - AHS is a horrible company to begin with (I'll save that story for another review)- but these guys were very unprofessional and rude in the way they dealt with the entire visit . As a home owner, I wouldn't dream of having them back when the choice is up to me. 

They also don't accept credit cards, with the repair man pointing out that they are too risky and insinuated that by expecting his company to take my credit card, I was somehow trying to rip him off."
"PA","they are expensive but did a good job and my house passed the pittsburgh city inspection.  upgraded to 220 amp service and charged $1600 but recommended by coldwell banker ----- i didnt want to pay for each bid estimate ------the estimate fees ranging from $75 - $125  for a bunch of electricians coming out for bids--------i am from out of state and didnt want to get ripped off since i didnt know who was good except checking better business bureau."
"PA","Had these guys come out to fix my bathroom exhaust fan per my home warranty.  They were fast, had the equipment they needed and worked me into their (very likely) busy day.  Fantastic!!"
"PA","Great bar. The prices are very reasonable and the band isn't bad either. The fish sandwich rivals Armand's in deliciousness though it could not be more distinct from it.

I have heard the bar organizes a shuttle to Punxsutawney every year to see Phil. That sounds like a ball!"
"PA","If you're in the mood for good ol' bar food with quick service, this is the place to go.  I've heard not much has changed in the past few decades, and it definitely seems that way.  We ordered the famous fish sandwiches, which were pretty darn good.  They were HUGE too!  

The highlight of the night was the Nied's Hotel House Band performing in the courtyard next door.  The crowd spilled onto the street.  The band was great!  Definitely a fun atmosphere."
"PA","We went to the Nied's Hotel for an outdoor fundraiser.  The Nied's Hotel Band performed.  They rock!  They are always a good time. I highly recommend you check them out. 

That aside, the outside of the building states ""famous fish sandwich."" Everyone ordered the fish sandwich at our table and we were not let down.  This fish sandwich was hands down the best I've had.  It is lightly coated on the outside so you don't feel like you are eating a bunch of breading. The fish is tasty and it's a really large sandwich. We will definitely be back and I won't be able to help myself but to order the same thing every time."
"PA","Great little old school place in upper Lawrenceville.  Ordered a fish sandwich for take out so didn't eat there,  but the sandwich was delicious.  Large portion and flakey texture.  Exactly the type of fish sandwich you'd want. Comes with the option of onions and pickles on top. 
 
Bar and restaurant was decently packed for a 5pm weeknight.  People drinking beers while watching KDKA on the Tvs. Classic Pittsburgh. Would definitely order again!"
"PA","Get the fish sandwich.  Best I've ever had.  The cole slaw is homemade and is awesome as well.  French fries are lousy. 
 
Don't get anything other than the fish sandwich, it is what they're known for, and their other food just isn't very good."
"PA","Great bar. The prices are very reasonable and the band isn't bad either. The fish sandwich rivals Armand's in deliciousness though it could not be more distinct from it.

I have heard the bar organizes a shuttle to Punxsutawney every year to see Phil. That sounds like a ball!"
"PA","This place was horrible. Went in on a Fri. night and ordered fish, clams, oyster sandwich, fries and shrimp. All fried food and we waited about 45 min to get our meals. We only got them after I told the waitress we would have to go so we could make other commitments. At that point I left half the party to take the other half to their art class. Upon my return to hook up with the people I left this oyster sandwich was waiting for me. The picture is what I waited 45 min. for. I won't be going back there ever."
"PA","I love the sandwich, but the rest makes this place a standard dive bar."
"PA","This place has the best fish sandwich I have ever had.  Better than Wholey's, better than Roland's.  Only sandwich better is a pickled herring on rye at a schnell-imbiss in Germany.

Walked in, and was immediatley amazed at how clean it is, and how old it is.  It is in Lawrenceville.  This is basically a hip little area of old Pittsburgh, where the young and happy have discovered they can live relatively cheaply, and have a neighborhood that allows them to bar hop, eat good food, commmute a couple miles into downtown Pitt and have a great standard of living.

It was Friday.  I wanted Indian food, but the wife's birthday is this weekend, and she had been saying for the past few weeks she wanted a good fish dinner or sandwich.  And I mean, this is not like a blue fin tuna with arugala on a brioche.  I mean it is like your basic standard Lent fish sandwich that you would find in your basic standard catholic neighborhood.  Nied's Hotels is the place!

It is a mixture of old style bar and fry restaurant, mixed with late night bar and bands.  You can come in at 7 a.m. and get a beer and a breakfast.  You can come in at 10 p.m. and get a beer and listen to a band and eat a clamwich.

We struck up a converstaion with the cook/servers.  I knew we were in a place that was worth it, when the one lady said ""Oh yeah, when we used to open on Sunday in 1975..."".  WOW!  One of those places where the employees have been there longer than Guy Fieri or Rachel Ray has been making the big bucks by telling folks how to make a hamburger.  

Anyways...  We both got the fish sandwich, with cheese.  $7.45.  And, yes, the fish was as big as the plate.  Twice as big as the bun.  And it was taken out of the fryer, drained, put on the bun, the cheese put on it (they melt the cheese on the flat top before they put it on the fish) and put it in front of you with a great big smile.

It was absolutely perfectly cooked.  The fish filets were covered in bread crumbs right before they fried them, then they served it righ to you.  There is absolutely NO WAY that you could get one fresher or better.  Well, you could.  But really, this was great.  If you dont like this place, you are just too trajically hip for your own good.

I like a blackened red fish on brioche as much as the next person.  But to me, to what I would think is your average person.  This is what you think about when you get a fish sandwich.  And, the way they make it at Nied's, is exactly correct.  Nied's fish sandwich is the best in Pittsburgh.  And I am guessing it is consistant.  The way everyone came and went, and the way the staff all interacted.  This place is great.  Just 20 blocks up from Round Corner cantina.  

Just to make it clear.  Nied's fish sandwich is the best sandwich in Pittsburgh.  Best fish sandwich I have ever had.  Best Best Best.  Period!!!"
"PA","The prices here are cheap, but you don't even get what you pay for.  Everything tastes like it was frozen, freezer burned, then fried, and I felt a bit of apprehension bringing certain items to my mouth.  The famous fish sandwiches are large, but not worth ordering more than once.

Note: this is a rating of the food alone.  I didn't drink here, nor did I attend any musical events."
"PA","Woohoo!  Haven't done a ""first to review"" in a while on here.  

Nied's is a Lawrenceville institution - in business since 1941.  They're known for their fish sandwiches, which are okay as far as taste goes and humongous, and I mean really humongous.  The only have IC beers, too.

Ambiance is very dive, but the staff is very friendly and service is great.  (I haven't seen much of the supposed ""nice"" out of locals since I moved here a couple of years ago, but Nied's embodies it.)

Keep in mind: this is four stars for a place that is very much a dive.  It's well above average for what it is and what they're trying to be, but it's not what you'd be looking for a little further down Butler."
"PA","Best delivery in Lawrenceville hands down! Ask for extra cheese!"
"PA","Great pizza and hoagies at good prices I always stop in for a slice when I'm near by."
"PA","Solid pizza joint with cool and friendly staff. Slices are cheap, $2:50. Also I tried a  turkey bacon 12 in. Came to $9:00...not bad deal for the size and was delicious."
"PA","The trick here is to ask for extra sauce."
"PA","My business is very near That's Amore, and without a measure of planning (which is usually beyond the scope of my skills on any given day) I wind up sometime in the afternoon realizing I have neglected to eat anything all day, and have no idea what I'm going to do for lunch. Now, you can only eat SO MUCH pizza in any given week. Seriously- trust me. I have experience with this. So, much of the time, I'll order a sandwich from That's Amore. My particular favorite is the Italian sub (I get it without onions or dressing). I've also had the meatball sub a few times, which is great too, but messy. There's just some days when I know from the start that I do not have the organization I'll need to keep a sloppy sandwich from landing on my clothing. Still- the meatball sub is a pretty good bet anyway. The pizza is good, though I prefer it when I have someone to share with and can order a whole pie instead of slices. The slices are good too, but given a choice I'm not a fan of warmed-up pizza vs fresh out of the oven. The pies are good sized but on the greasy-gooey side, which IMO does nothing to detract from the taste but will make you think twice about skipping that workout later.  
 
I've found the staff to be friendly and personable, and there have been times when I was too busy or just too tired to go over to pick up my order, and they've happily brought it to me. Now, granted, I'm something of a ""regular"" and a local business owner, which may tint my experience somewhat, but I've been happy to continue to do business with them and there is nothing like a nice, hot Italian sub when you're starving. They also have a selection of soft drinks and a surprisingly full menu of salads, sides and entrees along with the pizza and sub menu."
"PA","They used to do a good job and maintain their self wash/self vacuum stations.  The stations went downhill last year and now the actual car wash with hand detail option is bad too.   
 
I visited earlier this summer to be greeted by a pushy, younger guy that drove a Bentley (pointed out it was his).  He claimed he was the owner.  I purchased a detail and had to schedule it approx. 8 weeks in advance.  I had the detail done today.  A new guy claimed he was the owner and that the old guy was not.   
 
I had a bad feeling from the start and my gut was correct.  I never received a call my car was done, so went there near closing time and found bird droppings still on the roof.  The worst part is the fact there are acidic stains on the paint.  The car is worse off now, then it was when I dropped it off this morning. 
 
Avoid this place!"
"PA","This place is great!  You will not get a better deal or service anywhere else.  My car looks amazing!   
 
I wanted a full detail after I left my windows down during a storm creating a funky odor.  When I arrived the details were booked 2 weeks out, I told them what happened, and bought the SPEED DETAIL.  They shampooed my carpets for free, even though they were busy and it was not included!  Also, I had a dent in my back bumper, Dom offered to fix it for a very reasonable price and through in the FULL DETAIL I originally came here for.  I went for a Full Detail, and left with : 
1. A fixed bumper  
2.  Speed Detail 
3. Full Detail   
 
This place spoiled me, my car, and my wallet!"
"PA","This place is an absolute ripoff. I payed for the ""premium plus,""  which is the highest level of service short of a full-out detail. In this case, the ""premium plus"" amounted to an automated car wash and two guys hastily wiping water off of my car's exterior and then making a half assed, one minute attempt at vacuuming.  
 
The owner apparently has no desire to establish a loyal customer base, so I'm thinking maybe this so-called ""car wash"" is a front... I guess we'll know for sure when we see ""crystal blue"" make an appearance in Pittsburgh."
"PA","I don't usually get my car detailed, however I had North Dakota dirt and grime sandblasted by wind into my paint. No joke. The fellows working on my car did a fabulous job, especially Brandon. He even got the yellow paint off from when I ran into a pole:) My vehicle was sparkling and they paid special attention to whatever I asked. Worth the money:)"
"PA","Only carwash in the East End that's not in the ghetto. Getgo got rid of theirs for more pumps last year. 
 
The Express wash for $5 from 4-7pm is a good deal, as is the VIP Wash for $7 (coupons on website), which includes wheels, clear coat, towel dry, triple foam and underbody flush. Get the Rain X for $1 more. $2 tip makes it $10 total. 
 
The VIP Plus with Interior for $20 is naturally a rip off, but anyone with basic math skills can assess that vacuuming and wiping the windows for 12 additional clams is dumb. So vacuum yourself for $1 and buy some pre-packed windex wipes for $2 at Target and be on your merry way."
"PA","Underwhelmed is how I would sum up my experience. I way overpaid for the quality of cleaning. They forgot to clean my dashboard, the vacuuming was so-so and my windows were streaked. 1.5 stars and I won't be back."
"PA","I'm reviewing the ""do it yourself"" section, not the ""drive thru with teenagers"" section.  Sigh.  Why are all the vacuums I find $1?!  That is so expensive.   
 
So I pull up to the first one, take everything out of the car, get big time hit on by the brotha vacuuming next to me (to the point that he would not leave me alone), and realize that the vacuum is out of order.  I back up and go to another one, after running over my bag of groceries...  Already I was in a sour mood. 
 
The vacuums worked OK I guess, for $1!  I used about $4, and they did have a convenient, working change machine, so that was nice.  But, the entire time I was there I was being harassed by this guy next to me.  Like, begging me for my phone number, etc while he was blaring his music.  Then people drove by and honked at me vacuuming.  How annoying.   
 
So, for you ladies, I think it's just a bad location.  Go to Oakland or somewhere where women are more common (?)  If you're in a rut, I guess this place can work.  It's a bit weathered, but it does the trick."
"PA","I pull up to the Unique Autowash and pay $21 dollars to get the car washed, towel dried ($2), and vacuumed ($6).    
 
The car runs through the autowash--it's nothing to write home about--and at the end, there are three teenagers drying and vacuuming.  Lackluster would be an overstatement.  One kid never took his eyes off his phone and texted the entire time.  The other two did a mediocre job vacuuming and barely dried the car.  There were streaks all over. Pathetic. 
 
I would have given the place two stars, but at that price point, it's verging on a rip-off.  Let me note that in both Chicago and San Diego, I got the same exact service for about $10 and they actually did a good job.  
 
My car is still dirty.  Any recommendations out there?"
"PA","The Southside Libarary is recently revamped.  I ussually go here to get away from work at lunch and study.  Its perfect for that or picking up a book.

Tip:  They let you check out a laptop computer with ID and they are a lot faster then the PC's at the desks.

It really is nice inside and the staff are friendly."
"PA","Being the book nerd that I am , the public library has always been a sanctuary for me. 

The Southside  library will always have a special place in my heart. 

It was here that I took my first computer classes lol it now feels likes light years ago. 

This particular library is one of the smaller libraries in Pittsburgh and when I last visited it , the building lacked central air. But it what it didn't have in amenities it more then made up in architectural character and kind librarians."
"PA","This is a pretty small library but it's fine if you're just picking up items that are on hold. The staff is friendly but the hours are weird. One summer day there was a sign on the door, ""Closed early due to heat,"" which I found bizarre."
"PA","I absolutely love this place! I've gotten everything from acrylic to gel to regular polish. When I got a regular polish mani with Henry, my nails didn't chip for at least a week and a half. Usually regular polish chips within a couple days! It is true that some Steelers go here. One time I sat right next to one in a pedicure chair. I also recommend Nancy because she is very personable and so sweet. She even has a great memory! I moved to NYC for a year and came back to Nails USA for the first time since I moved back to Pittsburgh and she remembered me...and my mom! They're a little more pricey than most places, but it's worth it. You'll have long lasting nails and a great experience if you go to Nails USA!!"
"PA","Went in for a pedi on my lunch break at 1pm and was taken right away, which was my main concern since I was on the clock.  They had a pretty decent color selection and the guy who did my pedi did a great job with the prep, but only an OK job on the actual polish application.  I paid $28 for my pedi plus tip which was a decent price.  It would not be my first choice for a mani/pedi splurge in the future but is great for quick service."
"PA","I typically go to Nail Candy on the Southside, but they are not dependable. Meaning you never know if anyone will be there .....they close early and don't pick up their phone. So I was determined to get my nails done that day so I asked Siri ""nail salons near me"" and Nails USA came up. I'm not from around here so I never heard of them and was kinda nervous when I read some of the reviews. I went inside they took me immediately when I walked in... This really nice lady named Nancy did my gel nails and they turned out amazing!! I have to say way better than Nail Candy!!! It's so random that I found this place but I'm going to come here from now on :) I had a great experience! 

P.S. - I didn't rate them a 5 because you do have to wait only one person does the gel/ nail art."
"PA","So I needed to get my toes done last minute.  Originally I was going to wear tennis shoes but then decided on open toe.  So I alas I found myself at Nails USA since its a few blocks from my house.  I noticed when I walked in that the lady didnt open new utensils.  They were laying on the tray.  So, I didnt really think much of it at the time.  I thought that maybe she was waiting so she had just opened the pack and had them waiting there.  :(  A few weeks later I was at Kennywood and well my BIG TOE FELL OFF.  Ya you got that right!  Here I caught some fungus from this place!!!!  It ate away at my big toe!!!  About a week later ...my other big toe came off!!!!!  Now my toes are lookin so funky and I am afraid to go to anyplace :(  This place is NASTY!  Plus I don't like places that talk chinese the whole time you are getting your nails done."
"PA","My girlfriends and I decided it was time for a pedicure! My friend called ahead and made four appointments for all of us. When we got there, only three chairs were ready, and we had to wait about a half hour before anyone was available to start on us. They seemed to be short staffed, and trying to manage more people than they could handle. We weren't terribly bothered by it, as we weren't on a strict schedule. They had one guy that started on my friend, and we all had to wait for her to be done before he started on anyone else. No one else was available to do it. Each pedicure took about 25 minutes, maybe less. It wasn't the best pedicure I'd ever had, and it seemed like he skipped a ton of steps. In the end it was ok, but nothing to write home about. It was only $25, which is $10 less than how much I pay in the suburbs - so only for that reason does it get 3 stars. If I needed a quick pedicure, at a cheaper price, I'd go back here if I had a ton of time to waste. We'll see how long it lasts before it starts chipping."
"PA","So my boss (who is a man) told me this place was the best of the best! haha. He also told me that some of the steelers get their nails done here(no comment). I was a bit confused because it looks like your typical strip mall dive nail salon (80's airbrush decal on the window, strangely placed mirrors, two fish tanks, really awful ""modern art""). 

I had some time to kill on a saturday so I decided to check it out with a mani/pedi.  I was surprised that in a place like this it was $41 normally its around $25-30 in dive salons.  The place was busy which was a good sign but I was able to get right into the pedi chair. 

Pro: No wait, tons of colors to choose from, QUALITY!!!!! my nails still look awesome (no chips), the nail technician was very detail orientated, NO CHIPS! parking, didn't tear apart my cuticles 

Cons: Needs an update! A bit expensive for the atmosphere"
"PA","Profoundly unprofessional, with nearly incomprehensible financial statements and poor follow-through. Petty and rude when faced with disagreement. I regret having given them my business and I regret having subjected my tenants to them."
"PA","If I could give them less stars i would, routinely I would get calls asking for the rent in the middle of the month when it was paid on time, every month. The property manager, Carol, is the most unprofessional person I have ever had to do business with. She constantly would tell you one thing then do the other, then yell at me like I was a child. This company all around is the worse i've ever dealt with. WORSE THAN COMCAST. You don't ask for much as a renter and as long as you pay your rent it should be smooth, this was not by any means.

STEER CLEAR AT ALL COSTS."
"PA","I went here once and found them to be helpful, but there really is no reason to use a realty company to find an apartment on the south side. You're going to pay more because they have to take their cut.

Just take a few hours to walk around the streets and look for ""for rent"" signs. I've found a couple of my apartments that way."
"PA","It's divey, smokey, but cheap. Their batman shots are kind of what they're known for.  There are some regulars but it's never crowded.  I wouldn't seek it out but I wouldn't be upset if I ended up here again. Bar tenders aren't mean so that's always nice!"
"PA","For a small local bar, I really enjoyed this atmosphere and beer selection. Some of the most knowledgable and friendly staff I've met while in Pittsburgh. This place is great!"
"PA","Yay! Always have fun here when I come! The patio is my favorite! It's a nice little divey bar, and the regular rugby players aren't so bad to look at either! :x love coming here and now my best friend Abby works here so I have an even better excuse to come! The prices are great and music flows well! They have pumpking and I'm an SO tempted but I just cannot yet! Awesome place! Friendly, great service, good environment! :) food is also decent!"
"PA","My hands down favorite bar in South Side.I have been going to Ruggers for 3 years now the place is the shit. First they got an amazing beer selection that always changes. Next to that, beer is pretty damage cheap which is a win. Food is good too, go on a Tuesday if you can get a spot and you can make your own hamburger for practically nothing. My college favorite was a hamburger pattie, chicken filet, onions, tomato, lettuce, french fries, jalepanoes, pepperjack cheese, and buffalo sauce with a side of fried patios. This thing was so big it could barely fit in my mouth. I think with all of those extra ingredients the total cost with a Yuengling was $9 on Tuesday. The place fills up so you have to go early on Tuesday. But overall they have great happy hour specials during the entire week that are must to go to."
"PA","Where else are you going to get fried pickle chips instead of fries when you order a sandwich?! My love of fried pickles and cheese steaks collide here into yummy deliciousness. A laid back atmosphere on top of it makes it all worth it."
"PA","Rugger's 1/2 price ""pick your own burger"" night on Tuesday is awesome and cheap.  And they have a great selection of ever-changing beers on tap (I like Erie Railbender mostly and it's on special on Tuesday's).  Janice is the best bartender in town and she's there most nights.  Jukebox is awesomely filled with punk rock, emo, metal, rock, and other music your mom probably doesnt listen to now.

It's really the only bar  I like to go to aside from Gooski's.  It's nice to go to a bar and it not be all IPA's on tap.  If you stop in, say Hi, I'm probably there.

Oh and it's a Rugby bar, which is cool."
"PA","Ruggers is certainly worthy of three and  a half stars. It's a low key pub a few blocks off of Carson Street. On the night I went, the crowd was a bit younger (on average) than elsewhere is South Side. I liked that they were showing the Pirates game. And, I was very satisfied with the number of craft in-season drafts on tap."
"PA","Its an average South Side bar.  They have a good beer selection on draft and in bottles.  The prices for drinks are pretty average for South Side as well.  

The food is decent but the wait for the food can be terribly slow.  

We come here for the convenience of the location and despite not being the best we keep coming back."
"PA","Up side: Cheap beer. Cheap food. Vegetarian options on the menu.

Down side: Smoking (might be an upside for some). Sometimes smells like hot farts.

It can get really crowded on weekends, but I like it."
"PA","I've been going to Ruggers for awile now. You wouldn't expect them to have great food, but they do. Wed trivia is also the best I've been to. The DJ for it is hilarious and plays really good songs between questions. It gets packe din there fast on Wed so get there early.

Love Ruggers!"
"PA","Ruggers Pub was recently featured in a groupon. Since I had never heard about it, I looked it up on yelp and was pleasantly surprised. Dropped in this past Tuesday for half price burger night. This was 1 of the best burgers I've had in pittsburgh, simply because it wasn't fooled  around with. The bartender obliged me with an excellent manhattan. The staff was friendly. The other patrons were also friendly. We were a little cramped at our table but, on leaving, I noticed that they have a picnic tables for al fresco dining. all in all, very nice evening. Great food. Enjoyed the whole experience.Oh, by the way, almost forgot... Don't skip the fried pickle chips. They're fantastic."
"PA","Tried Ruggers for the first time.  I didn't realize until we ordered that it was a smoking bar.  Fortunately no one was smoking at the time, but that will keep me from going back.  
Two things I don't understand: 1) The rules in Pittsburgh regarding smoking where food is served. 2) How anyone can stand to eat in a cloud of cigarette smoke.  

Anyway--back to my review.  They have a pretty extensive menu, including some nice veg options.  I had the seitan steak sandwich which was pretty decent.   It came with fried pickles, which weren't as good as I was expecting. 

The biggest negative for me was how long it took to get our food.  I was there on my lunch break and it was not at all crowded.  By the time our food came , my lunch hour was just about over and we had to inhale the food so that I could get back to work.  

So if you don't mind smoke and you're not in a hurry, you might enjoy Ruggers.  Personally, I won't be back."
"PA","I tend to avoid the following things: The Southside, so-called ""pubs,"" sports themes and bar food, especially things eaten with ketchup. 

Now that I've discredited myself as a stand up human being, I will say that I love Ruggers Pub. I've found the patrons and staff to be pleasant, the music tolerable if not good and the best veggie burger in town, served with deep fried pickles. 

Yes, the BEST veggie burger in town. Yes, deep fried pickles!

**Half priced burgers on Tuesdays!"
"PA","I can report this is a 99.9% bro-free bar. 

There always seems to be way more guys than girls, but instead of the guys decked out in von dutch most seem to have not showered in a few days, and are down to have a good time.

Ruggers also gets points for being a smoking bar and not being too dank, and has a real nice outside area with ample tables/seating."
"PA","Some friends and I went for Happy Hour on Friday and really enjoyed ourselves. They have half off selected appetizers, and $1.50 domestic drafts. We ordered onion rings, 10 wings, cheese sticks, nachos, and fried mushrooms and our bill came to $16. All of the fried snacks were great, not overly greasy, and the nachos were awesome. I recomend checking this place out."
"PA","Friday night = 80s night and 80¢ domestic drafts. Its a loud, hot sweaty mess but good times are sure to be had by all."
"PA","Once you get past the chain influence of South Side Works, just about every place in the South Side has character--some good and some bad. Ruggers definitely landed on the side of good (thought not without qualification).

The menu is larger than you might expect from a place of it's size: soup, salad, burgers, wraps. They even have a few vegetarian options (including a rather distinct veggie burger).

The beer list is even better than than the menu. They don't have a huge number of taps, but what they have is almost entirely craft beer. They seem to keep something on tap from Great Lakes and East End, plus a few other regional brewers. They even tend to keep a fairly session-able craft brewed option--which tends to keep me happy. They also keep some bottles and cans in a half-sized cooler, but I've honestly never really looked into the list.

The food was distinctive--well worth eating, but not particularly outstanding. This is the type of place you seek out for the atmosphere and staff more than the menu. The tiny little bar tends to be packed on the weekend, but during the week the Free WiFi makes for a great place to catch up on email over a beer.

Keep in mind that Rugger's is a a smoking bar. That weeds out many, but I don't have too much trouble wading through the smoke. Weighing everything in balance, I do have to say that I'm a fan."
"PA","Ruggers Pub is a small bar off of East Carson Street, which means it is usually devoid of the general annoying bar patrons. While it is a rugby bar, it's far from elitist or limited. 

The bar not only has regular drink specials, but it also has an entire menu of food available. Huge sandwiches and your general fried bar food. The prices are slightly higher than some dive bars, but the quality of food is also better than I've experienced in most places.

The staff is not only friendly but freaking hilarious. The music is loud. The beer is plenty. 

I do have to warn though, rugby season is starting and this means an influx of rugby fans in the bar."
"PA","Great office staff!  Very helpful and caring doctors and front office staff!  Would recommend them in a heartbeat!"
"PA","They can get on the pricey side but the friendly staff make up for it. 

I fidget started going here when I got a very serious ulcer on my eye, I had to be seem every day for a week, then every other day for 2. The staff were so nice and they even discounted a lot of my visits to help out. 

I recently just got new glasses from here, a nice pair of ray bands. The staff member helping me was great! She took her time and gave her honest opinion. 

I've never had a problem here."
"PA","I spent quite a lot of time researching various optometrists in the Pittsburgh area and am very happy I went with Siegel & Portnoy on East Carson. I waited only a few minutes for the first exam, it was busy in the office that day, and the staff was very helpful and friendly. I've been wearing glasses since I was 5 so I know often at other offices, the wait can be quite long once you are in the exam room. My entire appointment (check in, exam, and picking out glasses) only took about 30 minutes. They have a really nice selection in frames, aren't too pricey, and I appreciated the staff assistance in picking out something new. It took only a week to get my new glasses in. I'd recommend this eye care office for anyone local to Pittsburgh."
"PA","I really am not a fan. I went here for an eye appointment and to get contacts for the first time. I told them I was very, very nervous about contacts and I had previously been told I was a bad candidate because I've always been really nervous about things in my eyes (for the record, I'm pretty relaxed about everything. I could probably fall asleep at the dentist...but there is just something about my eyes). 

When it came time for my first appointment to try on my contacts, I was having trouble getting the contacts in. The woman assisting me was getting clearly frustrated with me and had me almost in tears. I told her first thing that I was really anxious about contacts and that this was really stressful for me and she was just short of yelling at me about getting them in.

My doctor was the opposite...very nice and patient with me. However, when I told them I didn't feel like my vision was being corrected adequately (both with contacts and glasses), they said I had too high of expectations for what I should be able to see. I struggled to read the last two lines of letters on the chart. I can't read a license plate that is traveling a reasonable distance in front of me. 

The whole experience was pretty terrible...I can't see great with the contacts and it was borderline traumatic being yelled at over putting in contacts in the first time (only to be completely disappointed with the results). I need to be able to see far distances for my job and we haven't been able to correct enough (I switched job roles in large part due to my problems seeing far distances). 

Earlier today, I called to order contacts (I had given up and just been wearing my glasses. But for vanity reasons & working with VIPs lately, I wanted contacts as an option). The person I spoke to kept insisting I had never done a contact trial with them, the eye doctor had never seen contacts on my eye and I needed to be trained how to wear contacts, since I had never gone through any of that with them. I was very insistent that I had gone through all of that several times. It was a fight before they finally agreed to order my prescription. I did go through with ordering three months (only because I don't have the time to deal with it right now), but I plan to take my prescription elsewhere and find a new eye doctor.  

Terrible customer service and record keeping. Also...a bad selection of glasses. Really cannot recommend."
"PA","Best eye doctor in the city! I went to many different doctors before finding them. Now I will go no where else. I've seen Dr. Siegel for many years now and trust him completely. I highly recommend this office."
"PA","I miss being a South Sider, but that doesn't stop me from coming back here.  Best eye doctor I could have chosen.  I just went here on a whim and because it was due time to have my eyes checked out.  Best decision I had made.  

This new location is by far the best idea they have had.  It feels roomier and nothing like being in an eye doctor office.  I don't mind sitting in the waiting room now.  I feel so comfortable going here and I feel like I am welcomed here.  

The eye exams aren't that bad either, especially with how awesome the doctors are.  I had a few different ones being there on different occasions.  I usually see Dr. Siegel while there, but the past two visits I got to meet Dr. Pusz, they are both so kind and make you feel at ease when there.  

I once saw Dr. Pusz for and emergency appointment and I felt 100% better after leaving there.

The selection is so-so for frames, but I'm sure you can find one to fit your face.  

One other good thing about the place is if you have something wrong with your glasses after receiving them, you can just walk right in and they'll have a look at them, fix them there on the spot for you or try their hardest to find the best solution for your problem."
"PA","My peepers are definitely taken care of here.  I get a lecture every time about wearing my contacts for too long, which makes me know they're doing a good job (and maybe one of these days I should really listen!).  

I've seen Dr. Siegel for years now and he's always done an excellent job.  But the real testament to the practice is that I've actually seen two other newer Dr's here and they've both also been extremely friendly and helpful.  The last Dr. I saw, Dr. Klescz, comes highly recommended from me, she was just as great as the others!

I also think they do a fantastic job following up with you, whether it be with your annual exam or your order for contacts or frames.  Even if you call and leave them a message they always call back the same day.  That's a great trait to have in a business that I appreciate with something as important as my sight!  

The absolute only complaint I have is that I wish they had a funkier selection of specs.  I think they have a wide selection and I DO think the selection has gotten a little better in the past year with the addition of Betsey Johnson frames (yes!) so hopefully they keep going in that direction.  

The BEST piece of secret info I can give you....that stupid puff test you do for glaucoma that always makes you jump away like a crazy person....you can opt to have them check it out without the puff!  Yes, I just saved you from puff humiliation!  Your welcome!"
"PA","I am so fond of Piper's. Of all the bar-restaurants on the South Side, this is far and away my favorite. 

I will admit to you that I pretty much get the same thing to eat every single time I go: a Rachel with fries. I'm almost embarrassed that  I haven't broadened my horizons with regard to the menu in all the years I've been going here, but when a place does something SO right, it's hard to quit. The marble rye that is NEVER soggy, the Swiss that is always melted just right over the turkey, the cole slaw that is creamy dreamy, the Russian dressing that is just the right balance of sweet and sour. Seriously, I am drooling for that sandwich writing this review.

I typically go here with my best friend or husband, both of whom get either the Sheppard's Pie or Guinness Stew -- left overs are always taken (if there are any, which, typically there are not). 

I've been here at least 50 times over the last 9 or so years, I cannot think of a single instance of bad service or food. The biggest disappointment I've ever had concerning Piper's was a few years back and they were closed temporarily because of building issues (flooding, I think) and I couldn't go!"
"PA","In every town I visit, I manage to find a place that makes me think, ""if I lived here, this would be my spot"" and Piper's Pub is that. Granted it's the only bar in PIttsburgh I've ever been to, but when it's right you know it. Right?

We arrived with a party of seven on Sunday afternoon looking for brunch, it was packed but they got us seated about a Bloody Mary later. Orders up, English and Irish Breakfasts, boxtys, omelettes all around. It's a lot of food but we loved what we got. 

Excellent beer list (try the Fallen Apple if you can), great Bloodys and while I personally found the Scotch Egg a little dry, they're also like pizza. Even when they're not great, they're still great.

The prices are reasonable for that much effort and the environment is welcoming. PP, I'm into you."
"PA","At first I was confused.  Is this place Irish/English/Scottish?  I guess its all three which is a bit unauthentic to me.  Irish/English bars are not a common thing.

The interior decoration could use some serious work.  Having said that, it was good pub food and I had a great cider.

Very excited to read about brunch and soccer.  Will be back."
"PA","I LOVE Piper's Pub.  I lived right around the corner for 8 years and ate there often.   Frequently I'd get home from work and smell the curry... that would send me scurrying over to get an order of Curry & Chips (fries) to go.

The food is almost always excellent.  I've only had one bad experience, but the manager went way above and beyond to make it right.  Out of countless dozens of times eating there, one bad experience can easily be chalked up to everyone has a bad day once in a while.

What have we eaten there?

We love the Ploughman's Platter.... cheeses, gherkins, apples, bread and chutney... the chutney is AWESOME.

Other favorites are the above mentioned Curry & Chips... also the Scotch Eggs.   My son loves the chicken fingers. 

The Gaelic Four Onion Soup is always delicious.  One of their specials was a Seafood Bisque that was out of this world.

The house salad is always crisp and fresh.

The burgers always rock... as well as the Reuben, Smoked Turkey, Rachel, English Dip.

Irish Breakfast, English Breakfast, Bangers & Mash, Guinness Stew, Cottage Pie,  Beef or Chicken Shepherd's Pie... all awesome.

Bacon Wrapped Filet... always cooked to perfection... Stilton Stuffed Chicken... yum... 

I just noticed I haven't tried the pork chops... Jameson onion gravy... frittered parsnips and mashed root veggies... must try next visit!!

All of the portions are very hearty.  Even the kids menu boast very hearty servings of Shepherd's Pie and Cottage Pie.

They have a great beer & scotch selection.

If you get over there for breakfast or brunch... the Boxtys rock... so does the Belgian French Toast.

There's also usually not much of a wait for a table.  

Piper's seems to be a well kept secret!"
"PA","The best place in the city to watch English or European soccer. They publish their schedule online and even open a little early on some weekends if the matches are early morning.

As for the food, it's normal scottish/english food - bangers & mash, etc. On the weekend, they serve boxties, which are Irish potato pancakes. I prefer the cream corn beef boxty but the others are very good as well.

Service is pretty fast but get here a little early in the morning on weekends if you want to get a seat as all the futbol heads will take up the seats, esp. if there's an important match going on. (YNWA!)"
"PA","Great pub!  I took a group of business associates to Piper's on a Tuesday night based on Yelp's ratings and was not disappointed.  Great beer and the food was excellent.  I highly recommend the fried zucchini appetizer and the artichoke and red pepper appetizer.  Very good."
"PA","This Irish/Scottish/English pub is a fantastic place on the south side of Pittsburgh. Great craft/import beer selection. 22 Nitro Taps and 4 beer engines for that British Isle flavor. A fan of scotch you say? Then this is the place. While downing a pint counted no fewer than 16 different bottles of the single malt varieties.

Atmosphere is relaxed and not to loud (as long as soccer or hockey is not playing).

Love soccer? Enter this location during a match and you will find followers of both teams. 

What have I eaten there? How about Shepard's Pie or Bangers and Mash. Know what Boxty is? They do it with style with rashers (bacon for the uninitiated). Guinness Stew in a bread bowl for that cold winter night.

Give then a try, you will not be disappointed."
"PA","I lived in England for several years, so when I walked into this pub I expecting to be disappointed. I was happy to be wrong! I had the baked brie and a soup, but that brie still makes my mouth water. The service was good for a pub, and they brought everything out quickly and well cooked. I would certainly go again!"
"PA","one of my absolute favorite spots in the city. so much great comfort food on the menu. if you cant decide, order the Hot Pepper Turkey sandwich (add bacon). 

brunch is killer too."
"PA","I stopped into Piper's Pub a week or so ago for dinner on a Saturday night. I'm not sure why, but I went into Piper's with a preconceived notion that this was going to be a chainy, manufactured fun style fake Irish Pub. However, my meal and our experience changed my mind. This is just a good place to get great food. The serving sizes are huge, and everything we had tasted great. The only thing I was a bit taken by was the beer prices ($4 for a yunegling bottle is a bit steep.) I will definately be coming back again.
P,S. My room mate swears that this is the best fish and chips in all of Pittsburgh."
"PA","If you want a place to watch soccer and not just during the World Cup, why aren't you at Piper's? No matter the league, soccer can usually lbe found playing on at least one of the TVs unless there is a Steelers game.

But soccer alone isn't the sole reason to head to Piper's.  They have food that is good at any time of day.  You can also say that about the beer selection as well and that includes several cask-style beers on tapl.

I can't add much that hasn't already been said in the other reviews"
"PA","As a Souf Side resident and armed with my goal of eating at every possible destination in my home front, it seemed odd to me that the menu at Piper's had evaded me on so many visits drowning in their robust selection of beer and scotch. In fact, so much scotch that it's a known destination for scotch ... scotch, scotch, down to my belly ... tastings. 

Anyway, Piper's is great, doesn't matter when you go to eat - the menu offers similar selections for lunch and dinner. It's a vegetarian/pescatarian paradise - I go for the Ploughman's Platter (or Ploughman's wrap, same goodies just all rolled up), the Salmon Platter (good for sharing) and the soups have all been delicious. Seeing the entrees come out is enough to make my mouth water, even if it is a beefy-beefed up Shephard's Pie. Portions are pretty big on everything I've had; enough for a meal+ in most cases. 

And I usually steer away from describing scene, but it doesn't feel like South Side really (this is most times a good thing); even being nestled so discretely in between our neighborhood Burger King and Primanti's. The all wood interior somehow doesn't feel too dark, and it's a crowd ranging from middle aged dad's sipping the 21 year Glennfiddich at 1:30 in the afternoon and ... well, people like me."
"PA","Piper's Pub is truly worth the hype! I am in love with food ""from across the pond"" and have had a difficult time finding a place that accurately portrays the differences between Americanized and genuine English cuisine. I had a very difficult time picking just one entree to eat from the extensive menu, after all, who could pick a favorite child from a full brood. This was also one of the few places within the past year that I actually got excited over trying. The server is very witty, loves his job, had answers to any questions we had, and is Irish. LOVE that accent! 

The Scotch eggs (I won't describe this palate teaser as many reviewers below describe them accurately) were amazing! Our server explained that they are also served for breakfast with maple syrup. I so badly want to try this breakfast staple and maybe catch a football game (aka soccer to us Yanks) . 

I ordered the ""Toad in a Hole"" as described on the menu : Four fresh Local bangers (English sausage) in Yorkshire pudding baked golden brown and covered in our Jameson onion gravy. I can't even find the words to describe how tasty this was! I even had to take some of this home to finish later. The best way to describe the baked Yorkshire pudding is like the thin dough used to wrap a hot dog when making pigs in a blanket, light and airy and crispy. Darren ordered the Shepard's pie with lamb, and OMG, as a Shepherd's pie lover, this was the best I have EVER tasted! I can't wait to go back and try more things! When asked about the unique flavors, our server told us the chef uses sage to flavor the bangers and Shepherd's pie. I think I want to name my first daughter sage!"
"PA","This place reminds me of the great bar I'd go to in Ann Arbor after evening classes in grad school (but without awkward run-ins with underage undergrads who shouldn't have been there in the first place). The ploughman's platter and curry fries were great. It's also very kid-friendly (at least in the afternoon when we visited) and has an interesting kids' menu. It's a fun place to watch the Penguins."
"PA","Came in here three times during a week long trip because they are a devoted football (soccer) bar.  I was very excited to see multiple Spurs fans in attendance, although losing 4 to nil stung a bit.  

On a more serious note, this is a very good bar.   The only food I had was a delicious and gargantuan boxty that was easily sharable between fifteen people.  All three bartenders that served me were very cool, quick, and knowledgeable about the draft beers.  My only complaint was that they had no Power's whiskey."
"PA","I waited for a second visit to ensure I could write an adequate review. I mean, one magnificent meal that left my taste buds absolutely singing is one thing. Could they possibly deliver a repeat performance? Do they dare tease my tongue again? ...This is going in an unexpected direction... back to business.

All of my friends absolutely adore Piper's and I knew right away the food and beer pairing was going to be hearty and well worth the money I throw down. Neither time have I even been a little disappointed. The meals have flavor which is something I find lacking so often, and there is nothing worse than bland food. They also have substance, half of a shepherd's pie and I'm carrying around not just left overs but a sizable food baby.

The interior is on the small side so I've shied away from taking overly large parties there for occasions like my birthday. It's not uncomfortable though and if you wanted to try they may be willing to attempt to accommodate.

They have a great beer selection including a lot of local brews, which is sure to keep me coming back to any establishment. I don't think I've ever had a beer I didn't like from there. The wait staff is always prompt and helpful in recommending a beer to try based on what you like.

The prices are pretty on par for the quality of food and portion sizes.

In short, if you love hearty flavorful meals and great beers, Piper's should definitely be on your list of places to try when in the South Side."
"PA","When I lived in Pittsburgh, I would go to Pipers every weekend for brunch. Brian was always manning the bar, ready to serve up a Strongbow from the tap, and the boxtys were always incredible.

Well - things change. I've moved away now, but I still stop by Pipers when I come back to town to visit. They use ground sausage instead of real bangers in the Irish Boxtys now, which is a bummer, but it's still the most incredible brunch place you could wish for.  The people are great, the food is delicious, the beer list is fabulous (they usually have at least 2 cask beers available, and the tap list is extensive).

Basically, if you live in Pittsburgh, you should be eating here.  If you're just visiting town, stop in.  And if you ever meet someone who doesn't like this place, push them to the ground, and hold them there until the police can arrive, and then explain the issue and that the person is insane, and the police will probably lock them up for the good of society."
"PA","Pipers brunch is great! I take out of town friends there for brunch frequently. Fun atmosphere and different food for the southside."
"PA","Friday night in Sourth Side, choose your poison

A) Fighting a yinzer over the better QB: Terry Bradshaw or Big Ben.
B) Fighting a bro for talking to the girl he's interested in.
C) All the above
D) All the above, plus a 60% chance to view public urination if you last til 1:30am.

Or make it respectable at Piper's. Rounder patrons and less gloss than most South Side meat markets, you'll be safe from flying IC Lights or bar brawls--Piper's is for couples aged 25+, and they serve the meat you actually want: bangers and mash, scotch eggs, and a host of other hearty staples. Not much in terms of decor, but solid service, great taplist with good local representation, and excellent bartending.

Two secrets

1) ALERT Pgh soccer junkies! This is your jam. Get your premiere league fix, and World Cup coverage starts at 8am. It's packed by 7:30am on those days.

2) Amazing single malt scotch list, easily best in the burgh. Only Jack Rose in DC sticks out as ""better""."
"PA","My boyfriend really wanted to check this place out one night and since I was in a meh mood I decided to not fight him on it, but boy am I glad I didn't.  

Pipers pub has a lot of what you would call classic British/UK food but there is nothing ordinary or boring about it.  We started off with the scotch eggs and were not disappointed.  We have been to several places to try scotch eggs (my boyfriend's obsessed) but I had never been to a place where they were as big as they sell them here.  They were hot and full of flavor so I was very excited for our entrees. 

I order the bangers and mash which according to the restaurant the sausage they use comes from the strip district and it clearly didn't have a frozen/reheated taste to it.  The sausage was very good, and I'm very picky about pork products because they tend to give me a headache but these were delicious. 

My boyfriend order the Shepard's pie with lamb meat and chestnuts which was also very good.  Both of these foods, along with many other things on the menu, would be perfect on a cold day.  They were both very hearty foods to warms you up when it's cold outside, but the best is yet to come.

While the restaurant is very good and I would have no problem recommending it to my friends the one thing that sent me over the edge to amazing is their bread pudding.  I really enjoy bread pudding but find that sometimes it can either be too soupy or has no flavor.  Their bread pudding was without a doubt the best bread pudding I can remember ever having.  It was flavorful and had the right combination of moisture without being all soggy.  My boyfriend and I decided to split it but I almost wish I would have gotten my own.  

Overall I highly enjoyed piper's pub and WILL be back for more."
"PA","Nice atmospher, good beer selection. Had an appitizer, the scotch eggs, and then fish and chips for lunch.  Both were very good and i would recommend.  Seated quickly.  Waitress must of been having a bad day, short and not very informative.  Our group of nine was pleased with food, displeased with waitress demeanor."
"PA","I have never been disappointed!  The food is always consistently good. The brunch is amazing"
"PA","Their food is worth looking for the restaurant on a busy East Carson St. We are from Morgantown and were up there shopping and decided to find the place from seeing their Twitter account. The fish pie is the best I've ever had and there fish and chip are great."
"PA","Absolutely amazing establishment. 

Pipers has an eclectic combination of scotch, craft beer, authentic fare and pleasant service. Notably, they probably have the cleanest men's room in the South Side. Seriously, its almost like being at home.

I met with a few friends and brought my wife for a happy hour meet up. We stuck to craft beers, all of which were amazing. I will highlight the banana bread ale. I have never seen a banana bread beer in my life nor expected it to taste like anything other than a cocktail. However, it was a perfectly crated beer-tasting ale with a semi-sweet banana bread finish. 

We ordered the Shepard's pie, corn beef & cabbage, scotch eggs and bread pudding complete with Dave & Andy's Ice cream. The portions were huge and the wait time was around 10-15 minutes. The food was hot, well-done and very filling. The scotch eggs were phenomenal, especially with a hoppy IPA or lager. The bread pudding was homemade, not overly sweet and just rightly spiced.

I don't remember our server's name (sorry) but it was a lady with a sleeve tattoo. She was wonderful. She told jokes, was very knowledgable about the menu, made excellent recommendations to my wife on beers and worked quickly. Kuddos to her hospitality. 

In addition to all the positive things above, the prices are very, very fair.

I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore, but when I visit, Piper's will be up on my list every time."
"PA","Quality, authentic British pub fare with a good craft beer list and a nice bar at the front."
"PA","If you're vegan and want a really cool environment to eat--especially if you're with some people that love to watch soccer or eat pub food--come to this place! It's the place to be to watch ""football,"" and great for a home-european pub feel. Sometimes the wait can be long, particularly when there's a basketball game, so plan accordingly."
"PA","Great spot, by far my favorite pub/bar/restaurant in Pittsburgh.

Have been here on different visits to the city over the years, latest being a week in March. No lie, I was in town 6 days and probably put in 5 trips to Pipers each time having different food and different beers.

The food is outstanding, from the fry ups (ie full English), to the boxtys, on to the salads , specials and the burgers. And we haven't hit the homemade desserts yet - awesome.

As a hop head, I fully appreciate a varied and quality beer list. The prices are low for a beer centric pub and selection was interesting. Extra kudos for keeping a couple of cask taps on rotation - a rarity in the US.

Final word of note is for the football. A friendly place to watch the game, morning noon or night. Just wish they could guarantee 3 points with your 3 pints :)

Other than PNC park, my favorite place to be in town."
"PA","I want to give this place a one star but I dont think it is their problem that I dont like this kind of food-well, not if I'm sober and its 10 AM anyways.  We went in for breakfast, but much to my dismay there were no poached eggs, granola, fresh fruit or yogurt to be seen.  I could have had a burger, but I decided that would start the day in disaster.  I opted for dry toast instead, picked off of Kristen's plate.  All the platters looked really good as lunch food, and they were really authentic, but they need a breakfast menu."
"PA","Piper's Pub ROCKS!  The bar & restaurant areas have a great, fun atmosphere.  The food is fantastic.  Originally from Pittsburgh, I now visit Piper's every time I come home for the Stilton Stuffed Chicken!  My Mom loves the Portabello Stack, too.  An all around great place."
"PA","Great food and reasonable prices.
Try the pie's - they are great!!!
Awesome beer on tap..."
"PA","best bloody marys in the 412.  great breakfast with good daily specials (become a friend on facebook to hear 'em every day!).  awesome waitstaff. 

love piper's...even on st. patrick's day/amateur hour."
"PA","Now, I'm not Irish or anything but I have to believe that Piper's Pub is truly authentic. Yes? 

We stopped by Piper's on a whim actually. The beau and I were driving around this Pittsburgh neighborhood like tourists and had no idea what we were going to find. After driving past a few uninteresting places, we decided to park and just walk. 

That's when we saw Piper's Pub. As soon as I walked in I felt comfortable. We sat at the nearest high-top table and ordered some beers. I think the only complaint I have about this place is how long they took to get to us. I know that great beer takes time to settle and true 'tenders wait, but I felt like they were making them from scratch. 

Honestly though, that one issue wasn't enough for me to think badly of this great pub. As I scrolled the menu for something to eat I was tempted by all the rich, authentic Irish pub grub. Umm, can I haz mashed potatoes plz? Sorry, Cara... no. Instead I ordered their hot turkey sandwich and it was delish! Jason ordered the salmon 'wich and was equally satisfied with his choice. 

So, thanks again Yelp iphone app and yelpers. You've once again steered a tourist in the right direction. Feel free to utilize my reviews if you're ever in the CLE area. :-D"
"PA","Caveat:  I'm not a huge fan of Irish pubs.  Irish pub food is generally uninteresting to me, and the food usually looks like dull glop on a plate.  Not so at Piper's Pub.  I went for Sunday brunch ~2pm, and the place wasn't at most half full.  They have a great beer selection with a rotating list of good micros, & a special Sunday menu.  

We went for Scotch eggs & the Smoked Salmon Boxty.  The eggs took some time but my guess is that they were prepared fresh.  They were good...but I wasn't blown away.  Nothing against Pipers, I just don't think they're my style.  Interesting though.  

The Salmon Boxty...it was amazing.  When I go back, I'll likely get the same thing...unlike me, but too delicious to pass up.  It's more than filling so don't order anything besides an appetizer, or you'll feel like a fat kid.  Think of it as a potato/egg omelette...or just look it up on wikipedia for better description.  Seriously though, get it.  Your life may be changed forever.

Also make sure to follow them on Twitter; they always announce their daily specials & newest beers on tap."
"PA","Coming from an Irish family, I was a bit questioning about a British Isles themed restaurant actually having decent food (sorry Nana). But this place is seriously delicious, and has a good selection of a wide variety of food that just about everyone should be able to find something to eat (not as many vegetarian options but they're certainly available and just as great). The plates are a bit expensive but certainly worth every penny for how much you get and the quality of food, and the sandwiches are around $9 or so and are also big enough for two meals most of the time.

this pub is a nice little oasis in the middle of the hell that is Carson Street at night. One of the bartenders, a guy from Ireland, really knows his whiskey and walked me through a pretty good taster of various Irish whiskeys that are hard to find in stores and especially in other local bars. Another time, a different bartender took my fiance downstairs to show him the casks in the basement and how the whole cask beer thing works. Everyone else who works there, from dishwashers to waitstaff and everyone in between, is very friendly which makes for a real CHEERS feeling, a real pub.

This is a really fantastic place to go to celebrate something with good food and good drinks (their beer selection is somewhat small, but there's always something good on tap, and all beers I think are $5.37 or something close to that, which is a fair price for most of their selection), or to just come in and relax with a pint after a long day.

The Plowman's Platter (an appetizer) is an impressive spread of cheeses, and the only think that might actually be *too much* is the Scotch Eggs, which are worth trying but are pretty crazy."
"PA","Food is so good. I've eaten here several times and can't think of a time when the food wasn't great. Get some Irish in you and check it out!"
"PA","This is probably one of my favorite places to go in Pittsburgh, hands down!  Firstly, they give you massive servings, and when I say massive I mean it. They have good friendly service. Lastly, and of course they have killer food. Surprisingly, since they resemble and English pub, they also have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options! The vegan options are also not just a ""veggie burger"" or a salad. They have the real savory vegan dishes. I've had great vegan chili and I recommend the vegetable boxty, it was delicious. The only thing is if there is a game on it can get loud and crowded, it's not a huge place."
"PA","Best fish and chips in Pittsburgh. The haddock makes it extra good. The fried zucchini has no match anywhere. Absolutely the best. Thin strips of zucchini hand breaded with a sprinkling of parmesan and horse radish dip. We have to get it every time.  The fries are now smaller size and better. Crisp and delish!!!! Pipers is a staple go to for us. We've tried it all on menu. Black forest burger, fish, chicken waffles stand out. Service spot on always. Fast to refill real pro servers"
"PA","The food was good but I will come back because of the bartender. Very personable and knowledgeable of whiskey, and scotch."
"PA","A friend had told me this place was good, but he lied, it's friggin GREAT! Get the lamb and smoked chestnut shepherd pie! It was our favorite! We also had the fish and chips, and banger bap, both very yummy as well! The decor matches the name and Scottish vibe, and the inside is spotless! My favorite thing about the whole experience was the service. Phil was laid back, funny, and just all around awesome. Before he got to us, another employee sat us and got our drink order, he was equally awesome!"
"PA","Good grub, simple surroundings.

Soups were awesome, portions large. Fish and chips very good.

Fried seitan was disappointing, chunks too big and no batter. They need lots of work. Double wide makes superior seitan wings.

Courtney was a perfect waitress. 

Food is well prepared and tasty. We left stuffed.
Cheesecake was awesome. 

This was not just heated up frozen foods, but crafted food.

Service was excellent. She knew what we needed and delivered"
"PA","Came here for the Irish Style food. Got to the restaurant greeted by a door man and went inside to find out that the kitchen had closed 15 minutes prior to us walking in the door. This information was not in the description on yelp or their website. I think this is something that should be stated. 
The food that we did have was from the restaurant next door. 
The waiter was friendly and funny, hence the two stars. Was it not for him and how fast he served us our drinks, it would have been one star."
"PA","Some of the best food we've had in a long time! Chicken and mushroom pie was absolutely delicious and my husband's burger topped with an egg was great as well. Kids enjoyed their fish and shrimp with chips. All around great place!"
"PA","This is one of my favorites in Pittsburgh. 

The food is always consistently good and the seasonal specials and brunch are worth a trip. 

Some of my favorites include the chicken and waffles on the brunch menu and the current seasonal special of baked brie or goat cheese stuffed poblano peppers. The Sunday supper is also great. 

All of the staff is friendly and helpful and the drinks are always flowing. I will be back many times!"
"PA","An honest to goodness pub! What luck to have this in Pittsburgh. If you like soccer, this is the place to watch games with your  mates. The beers are super and they even have cask beers! Tons of single malts, and the fare is really decent, too. Never a bad choice unless you have to wait for a table."
"PA","A Yelp* search for a great pub pointed me toward Piper's Pub located in the city's interesting Southside which is packed with a wide variety of food and drinking options. Locating the place can be a bit difficult, even for ""locals"" I'm told, and parking is a pain in the tush for everyone.

Well, it was worth the effort. I received a warm welcome and luckily secured a seat in the bar area where 5 TV's provided easy looks at baseball and soccer. My server, Barbara, visited quickly and took my drink order; their tasty draft root beer which was served ice cold...perfect for the hot Sunday afternoon.

My Gaelic Four Onion soup was far from the typical stuff you can have in ten million other joints. No melted cheese glob served in a crock here. Instead, you'll get a unique blend of flavors capped with a fragrant crouton with sharp flavor. While tempted by other entrée options I went with the Chicken Mushroom Cottage Pie and am glad I did. The generous, tasty portion was topped with a perfectly prepared, super-sized puff pastry. I couldn't finish it but enjoyed all I could.

I'm pretty stingy with 5 Star ratings but Piper's deserves the top rating. Pub snobs won't find a 200- year old back bar but I've never known a piece of furniture that could improve the flavor of food or improve service.  Visit and you'll find a nice crowd, a great selection of beers and music that included everything from The Butterfield Blues Band to The Seeds (worth doing a search of both if you don't know them already!). Plus, you might meet Barb who, in spite of working a busy room, will take time to make you comfortable with conversation welcomed by any visitor."
"PA","I have fond memories of Pipers I hold dear the way people hold dear fond memories of Sunday dinner at their Grandma's house.

This is the first place I had really good scotch.  That's not something you forget.  If you dont know anything about scotch, and you want to have scotch, come here.  The bartender will help you out.  Laophroiag is my favorite.

The food here is also really good.  I usually get the Ploughman's Platter as an entree, i love the cheese and the chutney is quite excellent.  The Shepherd's Pie is also good, as are the salads.

There's often a wait for tables here, so plan to have a pint or so at the bar.  They have a good beer selection. 

When I come here, its either to specifically eat dinner here, or to start pre gaming here and then head out.  Its a bit of a mellow atmosphere, and I really like it."
"PA","""Girl brings 2 plates of full English over with plenty of scrambled eggs and plenty of fried tomato!"" - The Streets, ""Don't Mug Yourself""

I've had a full English breakfast in London's East End. It was amazing. It fully lived up to its cultural references in songs (e.g. ""Don't Mug Yourself""). But the ""full English breakfasts"" that I've experienced in America leave much to be desired. 

Until now. 

Piper's Pub's brunch is an extraordinarily British experience. First there's the pub itself: soccer on the widescreens, deep oak paneling, a bar stocked with so much Scotch it's mindblowing, and the coup-de-grace: a full English breakfast. A REAL full English breakfast.

So overwhelming were the choices that I opted for splitting the raspberry French toast with a buddy. (Do NOT, by the way, pour the inferior Mrs. Buttersworth on this bad boy - just let it soak in the raspberry sauce and slather the whipped cream over it). But I didn't stop there. With my innate portion-control issues, I ordered the full Irish breakfast. Eggs were perfect. Bangers were out-of-this-world. Mashed potatoes were appropriately potato-y - red skins intact! Ham steak was thick and well-seared. Tomatoes were ripe and flavorful. The roll with butter and jam was a delightfully sweet contrast. Good God, this meal was killer in every sense of the world. I probably killed my cholesterol level.

So how do I know the full English breakfast was 'real' if I only had the full Irish? I just know, friends. I. Just. Know.  

For this brunch, I will willingly break my rigid no-bridge-crossing-for-brunch standard again and again. 

Nuff said."
"PA","Good food!"
"PA","Best Pub food you will ever have.

Corned beef and cabbage... the best I've ever had.  Tender and full of flavor.

Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepherd's Pie... Wow!   Absolutely delicious.

Portions are huge.

For those not drinking alcohol... they serve a delicious root beer on tap."
"PA","Great food. I had the special, chicken stuffed with pepper-jack cheese, bacon, and turkey with squash and potato sides and the boyfriend had corned beef and cabbage. Both were excellent. Def will reccommend this place and return soon!"
"PA","I was going to be in Pittsburgh for the first World Cup game and Googled where I could catch the game. Piper's Pub came up and friends gave it good reviews so we headed there after my flight arrived. The game was on and there was a great crowd as well. Draft choices were excellent and food was delicious as well. I ordered the shrimp something...I thought it was going to be battered shrimp but it wasn't but still tasted excellent. Definitely would go back next time I'm in town!"
"PA","Pipers is what it is.  A place to watch soccer.  the food is not very good and the drinks are over priced.  The bartenders and waitstaff are usually friendly.  Some of them a little too friendly!  It's a nice place to enjoy watching Man U kick ass."
"PA","Loved this place!  As a returned study abroad student who spent a semester in the UK, I've developed cravings for bangers and mash and shepherd's pie every once in a while so I needed to find an authentic British pub!  This was pretty close to it.

I got the beef shepherd's pie.  It came with a side salad served with a pumpernickel raisin roll that was still warm and soft from the oven.  The pie itself was great but a little dry.  It also was baked in a shallow plate rather than a casserole dish.  I sampled my friend's bangers and mash plate.  Delicious!  The bangers tasted just the way I remembered them tasting in the wetherspoons of Manchester!

The dining area fills up quickly, especially when some of the tables are reserved, but we were able to be seated at the bar. 

Great service and atmosphere.  Good selection of British/Irish/Scottish beers on tap at a good price. Would've liked to hear some British accents but I hear this place goes crazy during football (British football, that is) matches so that should be fun!"
"PA","Meh.  I'm probably spoiled by The Rover in Louisville and from working in the UK, but I was underwhelmed by Piper's.  

Ambiance: They stole the interior of a Denny's to make the place - lots of plywood on the walls in a cheap attempt to simulate wood paneling, and lots of vinyl seating.  Kinda looks like no one involved in decorating this place has ever seen a picture of a Scottish pub.  Hey, I recognize that it's the closest you'll get in Pittsburgh, but that doesn't mean you get points for doing a good job.  If you're running a faux-Scottish/English/Welsh/Irish pub, the ambience is half of the game.  The rest of the it is having good beers and reasonably cheap, hearty comfort food/pub fare.  (Heads up for my review of the food: they fail that part, too.)

N.B. They don't put English mustard in the tacky beer carton of condiments on the table; I had to ask for it.  (I should've asked for brown sauce (HP sauce) just to see if they had any.  I'm betting not.)

Food:  The entree (toad-in-the-hole) tasted okay, but it was drowned in canned/instant gravy.  I'm happy there's a place here that serves toad-in-the-hole, but it's hardly worth the $16 they charge for it.  (Come on!  It's just four sausages buried in Yorkshire pudding.  It's easier to make than a burger; there's no way it should be over $10.)  The Scotch eggs, at a more reasonable $8, were way overcooked, i.e., burned, and they serve them with Texas Pete hot sauce instead of English mustard.  

Service: so-so - the usual, slightly unfriendly service that's the norm for Pittsburgh, but I wouldn't say it was bad.  The hostess was friendly."
"PA","I really enjoy this place for the restaurant portion.  It's usually been delicious.  The only bad thing is the unfortunate crowd flow, as the bar is right by the front door.  If it's packed, you will have to front and butt nudge one thousand people to get to the host station.  The bar is not bad, but it can get just way too packed over the weekend.  The Sunday brunch is delicious but guilt inducing, as I guess any bar town brunch should be."
"PA","Just got married in Pittsburgh, and decided to eat here after. I am very happy we did. The food was great and the service by Phil was even better. I give four stars for the food and five stars for the service, and will leave my rating as 5 stars here because where the food wasn't superior the service made up for it. 

I had the scotch eggs [note to Piper's; absolutely brilliant idea to combine buffalo sauce with scotch eggs!!! I will be doing this at home now too.], fish & chips and bread pudding. My wife had the curry vindaloo and baked brie. The fish (haddock) was pretty great, but the chips were kind of meh. They tasted like frozen chips and weren't fried long enough, but they were edible with the malt vinegar. The tartar sauce for the fish wasn't the greatest. I think Piper's could zest there tartar up a bit and make it great whereas it's a little bland now. The curry vindaloo was absolutely amazing for pub food! The baked brie was also amazing! The rest of the 1-star deduction for food is because of the water. The water we were served tasted absolutely awful. 

The service by Phil is what makes this a 5-star review instead of a 4-star review. He was so kind and awesome, and the estimations he voluntarily gave for the timing of food arrival were pretty close to perfect. He was so good at keeping up with our table that we didn't even think to complain about the water, tartar sauce, chips, or the one time I waited like a whole 3 minutes with an empty diet Pepsi glass. lol He was really on top of everything! Great service Phil! :)

If we're ever in Pittsburgh again we will definitely be returning to Piper's! 

Also, this pub as well as our server did not seem to have any problem at all with a couple of lesbian brides in rainbow-flag wedding shirts. I am nor sure if we just got lucky or if the place is generally gay friendly, but our experience was friendly. Thanks Piper's. :)"
"PA","Food ok. The kitchen should try the garlic mayo that goes on the salmon bap, it tastes like death, completely overwhelms the sandwich. Capers on the salads? Bartender was an ass when asked a question about what vodkas they had. Great selection of tap beer and nice stocked bar. Also have beer on firkins/engines."
"PA","Always have a great experience at Piper's Pub! They have a great draft selection for those of you who, like me, are craft beer fans. last visit,my boyfriend ordered the Lamb&smoked chestnut sheperd's pie. He said the chestnuts were excellent-smoky and savory. You could tell it was finished being made and then immediately served because he could not even touch his plate for the first ten minutes as the food was so hot!Being on a salmon kick lately, I ordered the smoked salmon boxty. The boxty was comparable to the size of my head and was very yummy! The dill sauce complimented the smoky flavor of the salmon as well as the potato pancake holding the bundle of deliciousness together. I noticed how nearly everyone besides the two of us had a bloody mary in front of them so of course i had to try one! I asked for light on the spice, however, it is a premade blend so the bartender added extra tomato juice for me, which made it perfect! Other winning dishes we have tried include the stilton chicken, the salmon club bap, the smoked salmon wrap, and the smoked salmon BLT. If we are ever in need of a place to go where we know we will enjoy our food Piper's is it!"
"PA","This is hands-down my favorite place in Pittsburgh. I have never ever had a bad meal here and I've probably come here once a week for maybe 10 years. 

Top favorites are:

- Fish and chips, smothered in tartar and malt vinegar for those hangover or self-indulgent days
- Chicken and Wild Mushroom pie for cold and rainy days
- Veggie Boxty and a Bloody Mary for those silly days
- English breakfast for chores days 
- Veggie sandwich with chipotle mayo and coleslaw for those days I'm trying to be healthy. 
- Salmon salad for business lunches

I love it so much that I have a meal selection for every possible situation!"
"PA","My boyfriend and I recently visited Pittsburgh for the first time. We did some brief research about the best areas and recommended bars/restaurants and kept coming across Piper's Pub. We gave it a try and are SO happy that we did! Our experience was awesome. 

We had such a great waiter - Tim! Being that we were out of town we were really trying to soak up what Pittsburgh had to offer and Tim made this so easy! We had the fish and chips and crab stuffed mushroom - both were suggested to us. We were so impressed. Both dishes were wonderful! Hands down the best fish and chips I've ever had. We were drinking all local brews and ciders - also all suggested....and delicious! 

Overall when you visit a city you know nothing about, you're looking for an experience. Piper's Pub definitely kicked off our night in the best way possible with good people, great food and excellent drinks! Whenever we make the trip back up, we'll absolutely be stopping by here again!"
"PA","Awesome dinner and beer spot.  I had the Dutch eggs, London dip and bread pudding for dessert.  All were first class, tasty and fresh.  Very friendly staff, good service great bar.  What's not to like??"
"PA","I was new to Pittsburgh and wanted to watch a football match. I searched for different sports bars and finally found out that Piper's pub is a place where I can watch football as well as have some good food. 

I had a great time at this place, the team that I was supporting won that day and also made some friends who were also cheering for the same team. Ever since this visit, I have visited this place many times,each time to watch the match and have some great food. So if you want to watch a match or just want to have some delicious food, don't hesitate to visit this place.

Pros: 
Tasty Food
Multiple TVs
Good service
Casual ambiance

Cons:
Might get crowded on important match days, and might not get seats immediately"
"PA","I love Piper's for 2 things: brunch and sports. 

Piper's is the only place I've had boxty, and I probably wouldn't risk trying it elsewhere. This Sunday brunch special is a golden-brown potato pancake folded around a generous pile of eggs, cheese, and sausage. For the best meal, eat it with sides of bacon and horseradish mayo. Round out with a Ploughman's Platter. If you miss brunch, the best bet is to order anything featuring Stilton.

Piper's is the place to go during the off season to get your fix of sports enthusiasm. It's got well-placed TVs, plenty of drink choices (scotch to ease those missed goals/rebounds/TDs) and fans aplenty in International soccer jerseys. Because there's always a game to get excited about."
"PA","This is a English/Scottish hyrbrid pub with a tad bit of Irish thrown in.  I am a huge fan of bangers and mash and so I couldn't wait to try out everything.  The hosts and servers were great and we were promptly seated.  There is a fairly new, clean interior that is split into a bar section and a dining section with some overlap depending on the group and what they are looking for.  I liked the atmosphere.  After perusing the menu, we settled on the following items:

Gaelic four onion soup
Scotch eggs
Open faced roast beef
Bangers and mash
Draft Rootbeer

The Onion soup is NOT a French onion soup.  It is its own entity with its own ingredients and flavors.  Over time, I have learned to just expect a French onion knock-off when it comes to onion soup.  Kudos to Piper's Pub for doing something different.  There is a large crouton with stilton baked into it.  It tastes quite good with the soup.  My only issue with the soup was the onions -- they were not completely tender.  Is it possible to have the onions in the soup cooked a little longer to completely soften them up? I know this is a personal preference and I would probably order the soup again but I would only consume the broth.  

While eating the soup I ordered a draft rootbeer.  Completely excited about having a good, fresh rootbeer.  I was somewhat flustered to find that it was somewhat weak when I tasted it, though.  The flavor was there, but why was it so watered down?

My first time having Scotch eggs.  It is a hardboiled egg encased in ground sausage, fried, and then served with hot sauce.  The flavors were interesting, but it was difficult to get past the flavor of the exterior.  It tasted overcooked and bordered on burnt.  Is this normal?  As we finished this novel, new appetizer our entrees arrived.

Both entrees looked awesome.  Spectacular presentation for both entrees.  I went directly for the sausage and my palate left me perplexed.  The banger they use has a heavy-handed spice.  I tried the sausage with the half-mashed potatos and the gravy in differing quantities and couldn't get past the flavor endemic in the sausage.  I had to stop eating it.  I was able to split the open-faced roast beef with my friend.  The gravy was good.  The half-mashed potatos were good.  The roast beef was good.  WHY did the bangers have such a high dosage of this anathemic spice?  

Ho Hum.  Will I return?  Yes, I will give Piper's another try; I will just make certain to steer clear of the bangers."
"PA","My husband and I went for dinner and split the Cajun chicken sandwich with bacon and Irish cheese and a portobello mushroom sandwich and both were delicious. A lot of choices on the menu and all looked tasty.  Great service. Over 20 beers to choose from and enjoyed the Strong Bow Cider and the East End Big Hop Harvest. Easy parking around the corner from the restaurant. A bit loud but not too bad."
"PA","Great food at great prices. We always have leftovers. The fish and chips are great. We also love the roast beef sandwich."
"PA","I stumbled upon this gem while I was out visiting Yee Steel City for one of my annual sojourns to Star Lake.  Man, was I surprised. I thought at best, this might be a 4 star pub.  After all, we've all eaten at British style pubs before and let's be honest - the experience is typically acceptable but not incredible.

I was wrong.  This place gets 5 stars across the board.  First, on the most important thing - alcohol!  You have a great selection of brews, some expected, others less known - mostly British beers.  You also have a great selection of whiskey.  While the whiskey can get up there in price, the beer is priced at your typical city rates.   

Now onto food.  Their portions are monstrous for the price you pay.  You are getting a steal!  This place has incredible food with incredible prices that come out as large platters.  I was with a party of 4.  We all had to box our food up and take some of it home with us.  

Finally, this was a rare tavern that had amicable and hospitable staff.  The waiters, waitresses, and bartenders all went out of their way to say ""hi"" and make you feel comfortable.  When we had a problem, they resolved quickly it without hesitation.  For this rare treat, I gotta give them a full 5/5 on customer service."
"PA","This is an excellent pub that for some reason I never go to.  I was here on Saturday and was really happy with the people I met at the bar and the staff was outstanding.  The pub itself is quite nice.  It has tin ceilings, copper bar (I think), plenty of plasmas, booths in the back, and a few hi tops scattered about.  I was really impressed with the whiskey selection listing even a japanese option.  They also a premium bottled beer selection and plenty of draught options.  I started with guiness, but then was intrigued by the cask option because I rarely see cask conditioned ale's in this town except for church brew works.  The cask condition was some type of winter ale.  It was good if a little too sweet for me.  I wasn't that hungry, but we did order a couple appetizers.  I ordered the ploughmans platter (cheese platter) and ordered the artichoke and red pepper dip.  I wouldn't have chosen this dip, but she seemed to like it.  It was okay I guess.  The portion was huge the dip was warm and had a decent flavor, but it seemed a little too greasy for my liking.  It was served with bread that could have been warmed up a bit.  The cheese platter was pretty good.  It was served with a delicious apple chutney, fruit and a  few gherkins.  There were two cheeses.  I think they were both chedder. One was flavored with guinness and I'm not sure what the other one was, but it was green and I actually preferred the green cheese.  Overall this is a really good pub, with super friendly patrons, and a staff that's spot on.  I'll be back."
"PA","I treated my sister Vi for her birthday. The atmosphere was very lively, what you'd expect for a popular pub. I did appreciate that they did not have music blaring loud, so you could actually hear yourself speaking. Our waitress was friendly and attentive; she refilled our drinks without us having to ask her. We shared fried zucchini as an appetizer. It was delicious and the portion size was huge. We ended up taking half of it home. I got the 4 onion soup and it was very good, but I wish they would have included melted cheese over the top the way you get french onion soup. I had a chicken salad, it was good and the chicken was very well seasoned and succulent. The chicken was the star of the salad for sure. For entrees Vi had the corned beef and cabbage, which she really enjoyed, and I had the Shepherd's pie. The portion size of the Shepherd's pie was massive! Instead of using mashed potatoes they had potatoes broken up into pieces. Also included were carrots and mushrooms along with plenty of delicious, moist morsels of beef. I was so stuffed I could only eat about one fourth of my Shepherd's pie, so I took the rest of it home. The food is high quality and you really get an impressive value for your money. I definitely plan on returning!"
"PA","With the World Cup beginning, Colombia actually playing and being in Pittsburgh for Father's Day, I needed a place to watch the games.  I posted a question in the Talk forum and the Pittsburgh folks did not let me down.  Piper's Pub was the overwhelming response and it delivered.  

Colombia played at noon so we arrived at about 11am.  We initially sat in the dining area, but after weighing our options and seeing some space we moved over to the bar.  Our waitress for those 5 minutes was friendly and funny.  At the bar, there was one bartender but he moved fast enough to keep all of us very happy.  I stuck with an East End IPA and I was very happy with it.  My wife and I split our meals.  I had the chicken & waffles and she had the boxty of the day.  Both were delicious.  It was my first boxty and I didn't get to take a picture of it, but damn was it good.  It was a carnitas one with smoked pork, peppers, onions, cheese and pico de gallo on top.  F'N delicious would have been my response that day, and it still sticks.  The sausage gravy on the chicken & waffles was quite good too.  

The place was packed with football fans.  English, Italians and yes even Colombians.  It was fun a fun place to watch the World Cup and I have to imagine a great place to watch the EPL.  I look forward to returning on a Saturday and taking in that scene."
"PA","Save yourself the airfare to the UK and come here for some of the best English food I have had - London included!  Their potato and leek soup was delicious and full of fresh perfectly cooked red potatoes and delicately fried leeks.  My husband and I shared their beef shepherd's pie & medium chicken curry.  Both were portions large enough to feed a family of four if you are willing to share.  The chicken curry was made with chicken thighs so you may get an off bite of fat but the tenderness of the chicken and the good heat from the spice will have you fine with it.  The shepherd's pie was my favorite dish.  The beef was melt in you mouth and so abundant in the dish, potatoes and carrots perfectly cooked made this plate so tasty.   I will be returning to try more dishes.  And if it wasn't a Monday afternoon I would have loved to take a stab at trying their extensive beer list!  Well done Piper's Pub."
"PA","I really like Piper's pub. When I used to live in the south side, it was very convenient and very tasty. I have never had anything here I didn't like. I have gotten the fish sandwich, beef stew, and shrimp and chips. All of them were very good and filling. This place has a cool atmosphere and if you like soccer then you should definitely go here for drinks, food, and the game."
"PA","Delicious food and a generous beer selection! I had the venison shepherds pie and it was amaze!"
"PA","This is the best place for real beer on the Southside. Good service and good food."
"PA","Best fish and chips I've had in Pittsburgh. The rest of the menu looked really good too. Will definitely be going back."
"PA","Love this place! Tried the chicken and waffles and it definitely was a good choice! Love coming here for dinner or brunch I never leave unhappy!"
"PA","Piper's Pub keeps getting better and better each time I visit.

First is the beer selection. They do a great job. The balance is excellent. Some places always seem to be IPA heavy or Stout heavy, Piper's always maintains a healthy balance.

The food is my favorite part though. They've recently started baking their own bread, including for their sandwiches.  Their Pittsburgh salads use good steak. Their pub burger is my favorite burger in the city.

If you want Boxty or Guinness Stew, this is the place to be. Both are amazing."
"PA","Definitely my husband and I's favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh. The food never disappoints and the staff is consisently amazing! Good beer selection and a cool atmosphere."
"PA","So it's the day after I first ate at Piper's Pub and I'm still thinking about how awesome it was. Seriously. The food is good. 

I ordered the mindbender's root beer BBQ glazed salmon which came on a bed of sweet potato bacon hash with a side of green beans. This was an odd choice for me because I'm not a huge fish or root beer fan but the fish was probably the best cooked fish I've ever had and the bbq glaze wasn't too much.  The hash was also very addicting and I completely cleaned my plate. The other members of my party enjoyed their beef Shepard pie and burger (I forget what kind) as well. 

The ambiance was a little lacking but not a serious problem. It's noisy and I'm still debating whether or not the paintings on the wall were intentionally hung at random levels and angles or if they just got lazy. Service wise, our waitress was nice but a little negligent and there were a few times we had to send someone to get her.  We had to wait a while for the food but it was well worth the wait.

I definitely recommend checking this place out!"
"PA","This is a good standby joint in the South Side. If you're a whiskey aficionado, you will be in heaven. The beer selection is also quite respectable with a slant towards bottled English beers. They also have cask beer on tap from East End brewing company, which is always a solid choice. 

As others have said, the dinner portions are huge. The fish and chips could feed me for a few meals. 

The real highlight of this spot is during a soccer (i mean football) game. Their website tells when all the upcoming matches are, and it's one of the few places in Pittsburgh where you'll hear chants of ""USA! USA! USA!"" when USA scores in a match."
"PA","If you're dining on the South Side, this is a totally solid choice; however, I probably wouldn't make a special trip just to eat here unless I was really craving some bangers and mash.

The atmosphere inside is pretty standard pub-type setting and decor; the restaurant does have a really nice tin ceiling.  This place does ""scottish pub"" pretty well, especially for the South Side, although it is still a bit more crowded and noisy than my favorite pubs.  (Side note:  The restrooms are right next to the kitchen door.  Apparently there is some sort of spatial issue involving cooks, waitstaff, and the swinging door.  If you are in the ladies' toilet, be prepared to hear regular LOUD cries of ""Coming In!"" followed by the sound of a slamming-open door.  Do not be alarmed.  Nobody is invading your temporary sanctum.)  

There's a pretty good selection of beers, as well as a very nice whisky list (concentrating, of course, on Scotch and Irish whiskys, although I also spied a Japanese whisky and a smaller but well-chosen selection of bourbons.)  The cask beers, in particular, are nicely chosen and served well.

The menu features all the staple food items I remember from the precious year of childhood I spent in Scotland -- shepherd's pie (beef and lamb/chestnut, which seems like an interesting twist), fish and chips, bangers and mash, chicken pie, curry...  Sadly, a lot of the Scottish specialties were a little bit pricey for my budget -- I just can't feature paying $16 for bangers and mash, toad-in-the-hole, or shepherd's pie.  The lower-priced Scottish specialties seem reasonably authentic as well.  There is a ploughman's on the menu (looks tasty, but I did not get it, because it came with apple chutney instead of Branston Pickle).  The fish and chips is another less-pricey option, only the chips are not proper chips (they are medium-cut french fries, and very tasty ones at that, but not big fat chips), and there aren't any mushy peas on the side (at least not that the menu divulged).  

I am kind of on a diet so I ended up getting a steak salad with Stilton cheese, and my husband got the Piper's Pub burger.  My salad rated a solid 3 stars; the greens were very nice, the steak was rare like I ordered, and the Stilton cheese was a good choice (I substituted it in for the ordinary provolone that comes with it).  The marinade for the steak had a nice flavor overall; unfortunately, the marinade also had a lot of salt.  At first it didn't really register, but by the end of the meal I felt like I was eating especially tender jerky that had been reconstituted in soy sauce and brine.  My husband's burger was another 3-star special -- the flavors were all really nice, but the burger was cooked more thoroughly than he had asked, so that the effect of the burger + cheese was a bit drier than he prefers.  Furthermore, the bun appeared to have been buttered but imperfectly toasted, so that crispy bits alternated with alarmingly buttery/soggy bits.

All in all, this is a reasonably authentic South Side simulacrum of a Scottish/British neighborhood pub.  I prefer Monterey Irish Pub -- although the food is less authentic in nature, it is generally cheaper and extremely tasty, the decor is nicer, and it is not quite as overwhelmingly crowded and noisy."
"PA","Tons of Scotch, cask beer (real ale) and great service..what could be better.  I was in Pittsburgh for two nights and was lucky to stumble across Pipers on the first night and had to go back the second night.  Bartender showed us the cooler where they do the 2nd fermentation on the beers.  Didn't try the food however it smelled great.."
"PA","Outstanding. Although, I have to disagree with some of the other reviews, only because this is not a British pub, it's Scottish. 

I have been hunting a good whiskey bar in Pittsburgh, and this joint has an amazing whiskey menu. On top of that they serve great cask beer, and it's served right (room temp and smooth). When I was there one of the staff members took me on a tour, and showed me there hand built cask system in the basement, unreal and well-done.

On top of that the food is top-notch, and the portions are huge, It's hard to find traditional pub fare like this anywhere in America. 

OH - and they watch soccer there! Good food, great whiskey, cask beer, and soccer - there isn't much more you could ask for.

The staff is knowledgeable, and it shows that they all love this place and their jobs - which I think makes any establishment worth supporting."
"PA","For the most part, I'd call Piper's a fixture of my Pittsburgh experience, it being (so far) my favorite location.  They have excellent beers on draft, and humongous plates of UK-style food.  The shepherd's pie is definitely two meals (and therefore worth the price paid).  They also make a good burger, but if you're here, you have to take advantage of the UK dinners.

It's not the same as a pub in the UK (I distinctly remember struggling to find ones that even served food, or had a kitchen open past 6pm), but especially here in Pittsburgh, it's as close as you'll get.

The attitude in the place is generally friendly, I'd say.  The bar area is typically really crowded compared to the dining area, so there is a potential for a little friction there just because you're elbow-to-elbow, but I've had good experiences.  Usually no problem in seating groups of people.  In the dining area it's common to find yourself actually saying a few words to the table next to you just out of friendliness (and some people bring their families to dinner here).

Next time I go, it will be solely for a Smithwick's and scotch eggs.  Oh yeah."
"PA","Boom! first 5 star spot in PBurghle for me. This rating is based on breakfast and pretty much nothing else. Scotch eggs are awesome, friend chicken and waffles--amazing, traditional Irish Boxty.... Just do yourself a favor and eat here. It is worth the drive and make sure you get some scotch eggs or you are missing out. Cheap, Good, Satisfying. 5 stars bitches!!!"
"PA","Since this place is so good, they get really busy at certain times.  My boyfriend and I went there 2 Saturdays ago during some soccer game, so the place was pretty packed with soccer fans.  When we checked in with the hostess, she indicated there could be a long wait, so we said, ""meh we don't feel like waiting thanks anyway"" and proceeded in leaving.  We were out the door, on the sidewalk, discussing where to go, when the amazing hostess chased us down and told us a table had just opened up.  She CHASED US DOWN to give us a table!  She must have, like, hurriedly waded through the sea of people inside to get to the front door.  If that isn't great customer service, I don't know what is.  We were impressed.  A+ hostess."
"PA","This place is amazing! I have only ever come here for breakfast but on that basis alone I give it 5 stars. Their Irish Boxty is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had in my life and the atmosphere is great. Oh and the Bloody Marys are delicious! When you step into Piper's Pub off Carson Street it feels to me like you've stepped into an actual Irish pub. Everyone is there to eat great food, have a good brew, and to watch the soccer games. A lot of the patrons are appropriately dressed in their favorite soccer team attire and it can get pretty rowdy when a good game is going which I think only adds to the greatness of this place. The staff are friendly, helpful, and really seem to enjoy their jobs. I can't wait to visit for lunch or dinner someday soon. I highly recommend Piper's Pub....definitely one of the best spots in the 'burgh!"
"PA","Note that on my Yelp profile, I listed a meal from Piper's as my choice for ""Last meal before I die.""  I only first tried this place last year with my boyfriend, after several friends had recommended it for brunch over the span of a few months.  We are now super fans of Piper's brunch.  The salmon boxty is my new favorite breakfast meal.  It's the best.  The bee's knees.  I decided to try it with banana bread beer one time and the beer was so good I had to have two (and it was not even noon, this is unusual for me).  So, yeah, I recommend this place.  The people are generally pretty nice and good customer service, too."
"PA","The berry waffle is simply amazing. Beer selection is solid as well. Plus, excellent football (soccer) coverage. This is pretty much the only place in Pittsburgh that has Premier League on Saturday and Sunday as well as F.A. Cup, Champions League, etc the rest of the time. This place is one oft favorites in the Pittsburgh area."
"PA","What awful customer service!!! I have never seen such a poor and untrained host/hostess as I witnessed today. The absolute worst. The blue haired host should be fired immediately! Letting people take up tables for 3 hours is an absolute joke. It's basic restaurant customer service 101....turn the tables as quickly as possible. If people are lingering ask them to head to the bar. Even offer to buy them a drink! But never have people waiting over 2 1/2 hours for a table for pub food....EVER! We are regular patrons but today was pathetic. The host was clueless and the bar was understaffed, all on a Sunday morning to say the least. What a poor excuse to say you can't ask people to give up their table....are you kidding!! They are basically just sitting there for free and you are losing revenue all because a host and wait staff don't understand how a restaurant should operate. We all love to come and watch the games on Saturday and Sunday mornings but it should be stated when seated that there is a 90 minute time limit per table and it should be ENFORCED. People will understand. Let them finish watching the matches at the bar and TURN THE TABLE! PERIOD! Again the blue haired host needs to be fired for his lack of ability and lack of customer service skills! This may be the last time we ever go to Piper's....how sad!!"
"PA","GREAT FOOD! This old fashion English pub has the perfect old fashioned food. The fries are specifically made to be crispy and perfectly salted on the outiside and nice and soft on the inside. All sandwiches are served on amazing soft fluffly bun they call baps. These buns are made by soaking them in a butter solution and letting them dry and not letting them be too greasy. If anyone who reads this goes to this pub ask for Christy as your waitress. She is an amazing waitress. I had the B.Y.O ( build your own) Burger with fries. In one word...PERFECT! The meat is cooked to perfection and you can tell the toppings are fresh. I reccomed it to anybody who is ready to eat some great food and have some classic on tap beer, not any of that bud light garbage."
"PA","This place is always packed on a Friday or Saturday night (I've been given 2+ hour wait times on multiple occasions), but it's not very hard to see why.  The business which makes it difficult for a group is caused by the things that make it so attractive to a group.

First, it's simply a nice place to hang out.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable (if a bit slow sometimes); the decor is nice and on-theme; and the crowd is a far cry more mature and diverse than what comes to mind when you mention ""South Side Bar"" to your average Pittsburgher.

Second, the food isn't just your usual bar food.  That fare is available, but they also have a lot of options from across the pond--Scottish and British specialties, many with a North American accent.  Not every item on their extensive menu is a winner, but once you figure out what you like, you'll get far more hits than misses.

Third, if you're a fan of single malt Scotch whiskies, this is easily one of the best bars in the county to explore the category.  The entire whisky list is great, but the offerings from Scotland are without equal (at least among all the bars I've been to or heard about in and near Pittsburgh--the selection is also bigger than that of any single liquor store I've been to in the state).

So check out Piper's, but please, not all at once and preferably not when I'm going there.  It's too crowded already.  Don't make me regret this review."
"PA","I definitely had a favorable first time here last night. Piper's Pub is a British pub, with all the goodies. I had the Scottish eggs and it was pretty good. I've never had Scottish eggs, but I imagine that they were authentic and delicious. I didn't love them that much, but I could definitely appreciate what they were - hard boiled eggs wrapped in sausage dipped in hot sauce. Around the table, my party had: Ground Lamb and Chestnut Shepherd's Pie - it was not typical but really really good, some sandwiches - they were decent sized platters. I'm definitely going back there to try more food.

Piper's Pub brings the best of unhealthy British foods for our consumption."
"PA","I have to agree with Aaron, and the more I go there the more I love the place. The atmosphere is what I imagine a British pub should be and the staff is excellent. We went for an after work happy hour and everyone loved it . The curry and chips are fantastic. So good that I took my sons back on Sunday for brunch. My wife and I tried the Gaelic Four Onion Soup and it was by far the best onion soup we have ever had. The Stilton cheese was the clincher. The portions are big and made with quality ingredients. The staff was very helpful also when my wife wondered what dressing  would be best on the Stilton and Rasher Salad. They have a incredible scotch selection. We have decided as a family that we would become regulars!"
"PA","I would say this is easily the best Pub in the city. Beer selection isn't massive, but it's extremely high-quality. The food is typical British pub food, but it is done much better. Great presentation, large portions, high quality ingredients used in everything. Everything on the menu, from huge dinners to sandwiches to brunch on the weekends (get the salmon boxty!), is perfect. Staff is friendly and on top of it. I highly recommend Piper's. One of my favorite restaurants in the city."
"PA","Being gluten intolerant, I was a little apprehensive about ordering a burger here (sans the bun). The staff was very accommodating and convinced me I could have the Black Watch burger gluten-free. Sweet goodness. They make some mean burgers here. The medium rare patty coupled with aioli sauce, smoked bacon, and an egg to top it off, was delicious. I finished my burger, which is saying a lot cause it was HUGE (especially for a small 5'3"" woman). Might've been overkill, but no regrets here. 

My friend loved her shepherd's pie. She still talks about it too this day (it has been a month) and wants to go back. 

The service here was excellent. The waiters were extremely friendly and hardworking. We were impressed.

If you are ever in Pittsburgh, go to Piper's Pub."
"PA","There are a few things in life I will never compromise. My word, my family, and my beer. I'm about as big a beer snob as it gets. Not being from the area, I wanted a great place where the atmosphere reminds me of the Isles. I was not disappointed. 

Piper's Pub is the kind of bar my Irish friends would walk into and feel like home. The whiskey bottles are too numerous to count, the beer list is extensive, and the food doesn't get more authentic. On the front window, a time sheet of football games is always listed - I only regret not being there on a game day to cheer on one of my clubs. The Shepherd's Pie was perfectly done with lamb, which is the only way it should be done. For the non-alcohol crowd, there is an actual draft root beer. The bartender was extensively knowledgable of his entire menu. And the best part? Bud Light and Miller Lite were not on tap, and I'm certain that the bartender would tell anyone that ordered one to either drink a real beer or get the hell out. 

I'm not from Pittsburgh, but this place would be the perfect excuse to stop in on a road trip."
"PA","Ate dinner here this evening with some coworkers ( I am from out of town).  Several of my coworkers highly recommended Piper's Pub and for good reason.  While there are several commendable qualities, the best by far was the meal.  I had the Guinness Beef Stew; it was awesome.  The beef was mouth melting tender.  The crusty brioche bun was soft in the inside and soaked up the stew flavors nicely.

It is an English pub so the place is noisy but in a good way.  It is old school pub atmosphere...very nice.  Dinner was very reasonably priced...paid $10 for the beef ste....it was easily worth $13 to $15."
"PA","A great location w English and Irish classics and also quite w few twists! The menu is really creative, surprisingly has a good amount of vegetarian options also. Good beer list and great service. Ill definitely be back."
"PA","what great food the fish and chips are some of the best I have had in a long time... banana nut bread beer is awesome!"
"PA","This is truly a gem on Carson if you want a properly built Guinness or are in the mood for another finely crafted beer. I have brought several friends here since being introduced to the place about 6 months ago. The food is amazing. The staff is friendly, helpful, and efficient. I have yet to eat a meal there that I could finish because the portions are so generous! Either that or because of the fact that I stuff myself with the amazing Scotch eggs every time. Their beer selection is wide and ever changing, which I love. I don't think I can say enough good things about it! Its truly becoming a favorite of mine!"
"PA","I returned here for some drinks and had a great experience. The beer menu is very clear now. There are different headings for the cask ales, Pennsylvania beers, and the other available beers on tap which makes it easy to pick one out. Unfortunately, there isn't much more information about the beers on the menu than what I already mentioned.

I opted for a cask ale (specifically, the Flying Dog Doggie Style Pale Ale), and it was so fresh! Just delicious. I followed that up with a pint of Troeg's Nugget Nectar (one of my favorite beers which is available for a limited time during the year). Again it was so fresh! Their tap system also keeps the beer well chilled.

I'm so glad I gave Piper's another chance!"
"PA","I am confused by this pub. Listed somewhere as Scots/Irish (a concept unknown in Scotland or Ireland) and elsewhere as British, with fake Scots coats of arms on the door, a saltire (Scottish flag) and Scots tartan on the website and the uniforms with saltires and the legend ""if it's not Scots it's crap"". Yet they had only one Scots beer on tap (cold Belhaven - should be room temperature) and lots of beers that had nothing to do with any part of the UK. Like the food:  The ""taste of the British Isles"" included such well known British specialties as Seitan Thai Chili Wrap crispy fried seitan, Mediterranean Vegan Burger and Salmon Taco Wrap. Which may be found in an occasional gastro-pub but are certainly not traditional.. The décor was nothing like a UK pub, and not enhanced by 7 TVs showing 3 different stations, and the café bit at the back looks dingy and unappealing, despite festooning the walls with Boots prints of ""typical"" British scenes.
If you forget they are pretending to be British, the food is actually good. If you forget they are pretending to be British, the décor is OK. They have a great selection of Scottish whisky too!"
"PA","My husband and I have eaten here twice. Both times I got their Sunday roast beef special and both times I was extremely happy. The only gripe I had was that my brussel sprouts the second time weren't cooked as long they were the first time. Regardless, we both had an equally great experience both times. They have a great beer selection. I didn't get beer the first time; my husband got Guinness. The second time I got Murphy's Irish Stout and my husband got a Scottish ale- both equally good. We shared them. The atmosphere is very nice. The bar crowd is at the front half and the restaurant towards the back. There is a sporty atmosphere, but the bar crowd tends to stay separate. We would love to get dessert next time, but both times we were so full on our entrees and beer there was just no more room. We will definitely be going back."
"PA","I have been looking for good British food in Pittsburgh for almost as long as I've been here... and I found it.

I stopped in on a Saturday night for the (extensive) Scotch selection but stayed for the Chicken and Mushroom Cottage Pie. If it's any indication of the rest of their traditional British menu, I don't know why you'd go anywhere else. It was flavorful, filling, and all around delicious.

Bartender Cortney knows his Scotch, too, which is very helpful considering their gigantic selection. They have half of their back bar dedicated to single-malt goodness.

It's also worth noting that, for a South Side Saturday night, the place was not packed and filled with the usual stereotypes. It is largely a restaurant, of course, but the environment is very classy. Seems like it might keep the annoying crowds at bay a little.

All said, I wish I could live here. I'll be back."
"PA","Love this place!  Very good pub grub, and a great place to take a date who has been looking for an experience outside of the norm!  Bangers and Mash are the best I have ever had, and Toad in the Hole is awesome!  Scotch Eggs?  You can feel your arteries hardening!  Dinner here is a special treat!"
"PA","Holy cow is this good. Good fresh food, great portions, good price. Certain foods take longer than others because they make it on the spot. You can wait a little bit. Have a Fullers e.s.b. , this is one of the few places in Pittsburgh that has it on draft . Typically I get the banger sandwich, the salads are great, English and Irish breakfast. My father inlaw is a Boston cop, and the BLT had almost too much bacon for him. Too many scotches to pick from."
"PA","LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Piper's Pub! This is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh, and my sister has to go here every time she visits. We love the Shepherd's Pie (I go for the beef version, and she loves the chicken). You can't go wrong with any dish here, though. I've had the English Breakfast (though never actually for breakfast!), the Vindaloo Curry (make mine spicy!), the corned beef, and many other dishes. I've never, ever disliked anything. My husband raves about the Guinness stew and the fish sandwiches. The chicken fingers are even awesome and the best I've ever had! Go here! You won't be disappointed!"
"PA","I practically live here, and with good reason.  The service is fast and friendly with servers and bartenders being very attentive.  I'm also seated quickly every time. I've sat at the bar, high tables in the front and booths in the back with all seating being equally comfortable and not a bad spot in the house!  Music is kept at a comfortable level and the tvs are always on [silently].  

Now let me tell you, I am probably one of the pickiest eaters on the planet so I stick to three things here - chicken tenders, mashed potatoes, and their chimichurri flat iron steak.  Even when this place is packed, food always comes out quickly and is hot and fresh.
 The chicken tenders are hand battered and come out golden with just the right amounts of pepper and crisp.  I choose the bbq sauce for dipping, but the honey mustard is also excellent. 
 The potatoes are a staple.  Half-mashed redskin potatoes piled high, always delicious and complement any dish on the menu.  
The Chimichurri Flat Iron Steak is a new addition, replacing the previous steak.  I was pretty sad to see the original menu change, but boy do I LOOVE this new steak.   It was my first time trying chimichurri and I think it's quite amazing, which means a lot coming from such a picky eater.  Cooked to order and perfect every time [I get mine mid-rare]. 

Now let's talk drinks.  I'm not the kind of girl who wants all the chaos and drunken blabberings of most other people's Saturday nights, so when I want to go out but not deal with all of that jazz I'm at Piper's.  I'm not a personal fan of scotch but boy do they have a selection! And it's all very reasonably priced; many things are a fraction of the price of other places.  Plenty of beer on tap, too.  I usually stick to Arsenal or Strongbow cider while my buddy usually gets the Wells Banana Bread. 

Bottom line: This is definitely a spot where you can feel right at home."
"PA","My family and I were back in town for a Steelers game, and visited Pipers's afterwards. I had been a couple times before, and even thought the place was hopping with the after game crowd...this place exceeded expectations!

Our server, though busy, was attentive and helpful. The beer was great. And the food? Fantastic! All four of us loved out meals. Highly recommended!"
"PA","Although Pipers is more well known for its scotch selection and Scottish cuisine it has some of the best VEGAN food in Pittsburgh! Their seitan wings with vegan buffalo sauce and vegan ranch are amazing. The also have several vegan meal options and usually a vegan special as well. They have a great microbrew selection and have strongbow on tap which is always a plus. The secret it out now, come have some awesome vegan food and a cider at Pipers. You won't be disappointed. The crowd is fun yet more mature so you won't have to deal with the  belligerent bros that you encounter at most South Side establishments, too."
"PA","My most recent visit here wasn't one to rave about. It was extremely loud inside. There was a group of about eight people say directly behind us and we basically had to yell at each other just have a conversation.

For Friday night the place wasn't too busy but they had a good decent number of people there. I ordered some cabbage with mashed potatoes and my hubby ordered the tiki masala curry dish. I didn't like my cabbage although the mashed potatoes were pretty good, the cabbage was just way too hard I like mine to be a little bit softer like the kind you get at whole foods but this was still crunchy and had absolutely no flavor to it. The masala was just okay too it was very spicy to be just a mild and didn't have any seasoning in it so it kind of just tasted like you were eating hot peppers.

I had my family with me and they ordered fried zucchini for an appetizer. And my younger niece she ordered chicken fingers with fries. The chicken batter have absolutely no seasoning in it and it was like eating plain chicken. 

I'm sorry to say that I probably won't be going back here. Most of the food was just to bland for my taste even the fried food didn't have that delicious buttery taste to it. Sorry but Pipers pub gets only two stars from me."
"PA","Piper's is one of those places that can only be described with words like ""amazing"" and ""incredible"". The food is always stellar, the ambiance is welcoming and downright fun when the soccer games are on. Really, you can't beat this place. 

Word of caution: Walk in with a game plan. The appetizers and entrees are amazing, but if you miss dessert you're going to deeply regret it. I still drool over the thought of the chocolate mousse I had there nearly a year ago. It changed me."
"PA","Do you enjoy footy?  Do you enjoy fried food and a virtual journey to the British Isles?  Look no farther than Piper's Pub.  Come in on a weekend afternoon and there will be no shortage of people wearing random jerseys catching the latest Arsenal versus Liverpool showdown (or perhaps Aston Villa v. Man City, who knows!)  Football, Ale, and Fish n Chips sum up this place and it's the best selection/version of each one can hope for around these parts.  Hear there's a chip shop opening up next door soon but no word yet as to when..."
"PA","Piper's is satisfactory in some ways and excellent in others. 

For instance, if your thing is waking up at 8am on a Saturday to stand around a bar and watch Premiership matches until 2pm, you probably already know, there's no better place to do so in Pittsburgh.

If you're at home on the South Side, you'll enjoy the vibe here. Personally, for a British-style pub, I'd like the entire place to have as much character as its entryway. Throw in some drab green carpet and trough-style urinals if that's what it takes.

The pub fare here is good as well. The portions they dole out are substantial which is great if your hungry/hungover -- as many tend to be -- but overwhelming and potentially disastrous if you're of the mind to moderate your consumption. I've eaten here a handful of times, but nothing has stuck out to me enough to comment on specifically."
"PA","Nothing stays the same! My dad always told me that but with the pub it really went down. As loyal customers for years we came to get our favorite dishes, smoked Salmon trio, across the pond steak dinner, and shepherds pie. Only to find the menu changed because the dishes ""were too labor intensive and the other ones were a matter of numbers"" even though before the steak special was always sold out! Now they have sandwiches and lots of mexican dishes, who wants their new menu items black bean soup, tacos and dirty rice ect.  at a pub? Compared to exquisite authentic pub dinners that are not nearly as good. The shepherds pie had raw extremely pink ground lamb that was inedible! Needless to say we will not go back, they still have a great bar selection but don't go for dinner! All good things truly do come to an end...especially for Pipers Pub."
"PA","I enjoyed this little spot because I've never been to an Irish pub before. Unfortunately I was on my vegetarian diet so I could try any of their meat dishes. I ended up getting a salad which is well, just a salad. They had a good selection of beer tho. I love stouts so they had a couple to choose from for me. 

The interior is kinda dimly lit except for the tables which each have their own lamps. It was a family friendly environment with booths and tables as well as bar seating. i believe they had Tv's at the bar and one tv located in the dining section.

There's not much more i can say about this place seeing that my experience wasn't outstanding but just good service. Maybe ill try it again in the future since i am eating meat again."
"PA","Great place and they are what got me to start eating Shepherds Pies. I highly recommend. Also, the service is great."
"PA","It is hard not to say the same thing that hasn't already been said. The folks at this establishment really know how to put together great food and good atmosphere. Beer selection is really good. Whisky selection is fantastic. Wait staff and bartenders are very good as well. They genuinely want to be there. This is my new favorite spot to eat when I am in Pittsburgh."
"PA","This place is great! The food tastes like it is homemade and I get to watch soccer at the same time so that's a plus. I have gotten the beef Shepard's pie, Chicken Bap, Beef Stew, and the Fish sandwich. I also have to say that the French fries are to die for! I would say that this place is one of the best in the south side for food and drinks."
"PA","Been here a few times. All the food I tried was great and the staff was really nice. Huge variety of drinks!"
"PA","Don't like to be the person to go against popular opinion but this place is only ok. There's no real atmosphere there. The food is decent and I've had the brunch a few times. I think I'd like it a lot more if the drinks weren't so expensive."
"PA","Great British pub food
I felt I was in England"
"PA","Where has Piper's Pub been all of my life!  This one establishment completely makes up for the bombardment of crappy faux-Gaelic pubs throughout the Pittsburgh region that are plague by bad service, poor food, and lame gimmicks.

Piper's is the kind of place you can find refuge at 11pm on a Friday or Saturday night from the chaos that is the South Side.  Walk in, grab a seat at the bar, and have a conversation at a reasonable volume with your good friends over a fantastic draft selection.

If you're hungry, you're in for a treat.  Try anything on the ""over the pond"" section of the menu, and you're sure to be pleased.  On the rare occasion I gain the courage to move past the Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepard's Pie, the Guinness Stew and the Bangers and Mash both present delicious alternatives.

Bachelor party dinner, father's day dinner, or an evening out with your friends, Piper's pub represents the one-size-fits-all multi-tool of food and beer pleasure."
"PA","When I see any kind of ""Pub"", my antennae raise.  I've been to so many ""Authentic"" Irish/British Pubs that have disappointed. It ain't enough to serve Guinness and Corned Beef. 
Then again, I've never been over to Blighty or the Emerald Isle, so I don't have a  reliable point of referance. But I DO have a pretty good bullshit detector, and I know a good place from a bad one. 
Piper's is DEFINITELY a GOOD one.
A little different, 'cos it's a SCOTTISH pub. I was comforted by seeing the extensive collection (one whole side of the long back-bar) of Scots Whisky. I was kinda pissed the nature of the luncheon precluded partaking in the smoky goodness of a wee nip-but as I am planning a return trip to Pitts, I will catch up.
The Menu had all the stuff you'd expect to find, although no haggis.  I had their version of ""Toad In the Hole"" which was a dish of Bangers in Yorkshire Pudding.  This had ""Me"" all over it. I like Bangers and I like Yorkshire Pudding.
It was advertised as coming with a Whisky-Onion Gravy, which I asked for on the side, as I also ordered a cup of the ""Hot Curry Sauce"" offered on other dishes.
The plate was attractive-4 nice fat sausages in a remarkably light surrounding shell of Yorkshire Pudding. Both gravies/sauces were very very tasty. This shit didn't come frozen-SOMEONE who knew their way around a kitchen was doing their job, and doing it well. I was very very pleased.
My companions had Fish and Chips, and a Steak Salad, both of which were substantial in size and appetizing in appearance. I would have been satsified with either one, but I'm glad I swung with the Bangers. I gave a momentary eye to the  Smoked Salmon Boxty, but sausages always win...
Pub food isn't my usual choice, but I'd come back here in a heartbeat, and I intend to."
"PA","One of my favorite places on the South Side.  The food is original.  I usually get the Stilton Stuffed Chicken,  it takes time and the server lets you know this. The tatse is outstanding,  it's always piping hot. My companion usually gets the New York Strip Steak,  it's a great price for such a big steak.  Everyone is friendly.  Worth trying!"
"PA","Authentic pub, good eats, good drinks, televisions with soccer, rugby, and Pittsburgh sports.  

Opens stupidly early on weekends, so that they can catch European sports live.  When they're open early on weekends, they have a terrific brunch; please, please, please try the boxty brunch here.  (Fried hashbrown potato pancake stuffed with other delicious foods.)

One of the best bars in the city; if I was picking a top-five, this would be in."
"PA","Bloody Mary was awesome. We went for brunch and I had the American breakfast, the potatoes were awesome. Hubby had French toast, it was such a large portion he ate almost the whole thing cause it was so good.  Can't wait to go back and get the fish and chips. 
Took awhile to get our food, that's why only 4 stars."
"PA","I've visited at least a hundred pubs from the East coast all the way to Hawaii and Piper's is in my top 3 of all time.

Every time I have visited the bartender has been friendly and most importantly, knowledgeable about their food and the beer.  

Their beer selection is amazing.  They emphasize quality over quantity and for me, they get it right.  I appreciate that they go out of their way to always feature about a dozen PA breweries.  I love that.

The food is so far beyond typical pub fare that that it's hard to compare to anyone else.  The quality is incredible.  The Scotch Eggs ($7.95) are a transcendental experience.  Of course it may be they last experience you ever have as you are whisked off to the ER to have a Roto-Rooter job on your arteries.

Try either the beef or chicken Shepherd's pie ($9.95) and be prepared to moan with delight.  As you can see from the prices there is no need to take out a second mortgage to visit here.  It's really quite reasonable.  

The number choices available for food on Carson Street are phenomenal but much of it is average at best.  Visit Piper's and you'll enjoy some of the finest casual food on the South Side."
"PA","The food here for Sunday brunch will not disappoint. I had the smoked salmon boxty and really liked it. Portions are huge. The service was not great, but is to be expected at these spots. Go for Sunday brunch with the right company, and you'll have fun."
"PA","When I'm looking for Fish n Chips, a good Scotch, tasty brew, or authentic Scottish/Irish delicacies, I make my way to Pipers Pub.  This is not your ""college student"" venue on the Southside, so you don't have to worry about being bombarded with the drunks.  Its a nice break away from the Carson Street Crazies.  Whether you're in there for a pint, bangers and mash, or to catch a game (there's always some form of sports on the TVs), you'll be yet another satisfied customer and come back again and again.  Cheers!"
"PA","HOO-RAY for boxee Sunday's This place is great but can get SO packed.

Pipers really has moved up in the world and is now crowded all the time.  It's worth it though.  The food is excellent, staff always good and the beer and drinks are reasonable.

Go on Sunday for brunch."
"PA","I will make this brief.   This is not just the best Scottish pub in Pittsburgh, this might be the best pub / bar / restaurant in Pittsburgh - period. 

FOOD
Love the scotch eggs but the cardiologist said to only have these once a decade.  Stilton and Rasher salad is incredible.  Pub burger is the BEST!  Reuben and Fish & Chips are excellent.  Open face roast beef on italian bread covered with a dark/rich whisky onion gravy and a side of half-mashed red potatoes = ultimate comfort food.  So many other great options - you cannot go wrong!

DRINK
Love the beer list.  There is a focus on imports but they also have a dozen or so excellent PA craft beers on the list.   This place takes everything that they do seriously - the beer tastes fresh and the lines are clean.  If you are a fan of scotch whiskey, the list at Piper's Pub cannot be beat - http://piperspub.com/scotch/

SOCCER / FOOTBALL
Fans of the beautiful game rejoice - you have found your home at Piper's Pub.  This place is packed during the big games and they get satellite feeds beyond ESPN and Fox Soccer Channel.   Every once in a while, I get my boys out of school early and we throw on the EPL jerseys and we go catch an afternoon game at Piper's Pub with other raving lunatic fans.  This place is worth a 2 hour drive if you are not in the Pittsburgh area.

Definitely deserving of 5 stars.  Love it!"
"PA","We visited on a recent Sunday afternoon.  We got a cozy booth in the back and was greeted right away by our friendly server.  Everyone here is very welcoming.  BJ was very excited by the beer selection.  

Having absolutely no sense of adventure here, I opted for the Shrimp and Chips.  They were surprising good, 6 super big beer-battered shrimp served with yummy French fries.  I loved my meal.  The ever most adventuresome BJ ordered Corned Beef and Cabbage.  It was perfected cooked, the cabbage was the correct about of doneness.  Yes, I sampled BJ's meal.  

We shared a Bread Pudding for dessert.  It was made from Italian bread.  It was served overly hot, but it was delicious.  We will definitely be back for another try."
"PA","My review of Piper's is going to be short and sweet.  I've ate and drank here countless times and I've never had a bad meal or experience.  Their mix of traditional pub grub and more authentic dishes have always been tasty and satisfying.  The food is always served piping hot and the service has always been pleasant.  The sheppard's pie is delicious and my personal favorite on the menu along with the scotch eggs.  With great draft beer on tap and a lack of wall to wall people on Friday or Saturday I find myself coming back quite often."
"PA","Ballast point on tap. Great food and knowleable servers."
"PA","I came here after reading that Piper's Pub serves Cask Ales. The beer menu is a little confusing; the cask ale was listed at the top followed by a group of four ales followed by a larger group of options. It wasn't clear why the menu was segregated the way it was, but the number of options was quite impressive; however, I was disappointed that they did not have Tennent's considering that Piper's is supposed to be a Scottish Pub.

I ended up trying the Duck-Rabbit Milk Stout. The stout didn't seem to have very strong chocolate malts which is what I look for when ordering a stout. (The rating I am awarding Piper's Pub does not reflect how I feel about the stout). When the stout was served it had absolutely no head; I understand Piper's prides itself on not having sparklers, but stouts should be served with a small head.

As for food I ordered chicken fingers. Again, I was disappointed not to see Haggis - a staple of Scottish cuisine. The chicken fingers were fine; however, not that I have read a few of the Yelp review, I will be more inclined to order a British dish next time. The menu did not indicate that the British (predominantly English) dishes were the house's specialty.

On the positive side, our waitress was very attentive.  I will certainly give Piper's another chance during which I will order a British dish and a cask or lighter draught ale."
"PA","I came here for brunch a week or so ago and was pleasantly surprised! The options were diverse and everyone seemed to like what they ordered.  I ordered the french toast, which was a quite a large portion and prepared quite well.  I would highly recommend Piper's if you're on the Southside looking for brunch."
"PA","Excellent Irish pub. Great beer selection and great food, including weekend brunch.  Unfortunately I went in the middle of a soccer game and apparently this is where all the soccer fans in Pittsburgh go to watch!  So I had to wait over an hour for a table but it was worth it.  I was a little frustrated people were just sitting at the tables not ordering anything to watch the game while my friend and I were actually there to order food, but it seemed to be a special event and probably not typical.  Awesome scotch eggs and boxty.  The atmosphere is also your typical Irish pub."
"PA","One of my favorite bar/restaurants in Pittsburgh.  I always find a seat at the bar and the service is always great.   The scotch eggs are out of this world!! 
The beer selection is outstanding and although I love the scotch eggs .. there are many other menu items that are just mouth watering such as the turkey sandwich with dill mayo.. oh my..   lets go now!

Love Pipers Pub!"
"PA","I love this place! Some friends and I scheduled an informal whiskey tasting, and the bartender put together a flight for us. He was very knowledgeable about the background/flavors, and was happy to take the time to share his wealth of information. We had people of all different levels of experience, and everyone seemed to enjoy it equally. We also all enjoyed our food. I got the New York Strip Streak special which came with a demi-glaze. It was pretty good, as were the brussels sprouts and mac & cheese that came on the side. The portion was huge, but I was still tempted by the bread pudding for dessert, and it was AMAZING. It came with lots of raisins and was perfectly moist all the way through.

It looks like it would be a fun spot to grab a drink on the weekends too, and I've heard great things about the brunch. I'll update the review once I try it!"
"PA","I am so beside myself ALL THE TIME that I can't find anything that can compare to a Piper's boxty in Wisconsin or Ohio. Every single morsel of food I've EVER put into my mouth at Piper's has been pure heaven. We're only in town for occasional family visits, but we make it an absolute point to stop in to Piper's. Even if we have to fight the throngs of soccer fans during a match.
The craft beer! The scotch!! THE BOOOOXXXTYYY.

See y'all on Christmas eve."
"PA","THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS!!!! Oh. WOW. Yes. The food is a tasty treat. I got the Toad in the Hole and it's in the running for my last meal.

Beer selection is also delicious. I love that they have 5-6 beers on cask. There is enough variety to please beer drinkers of all shapes and sizes.

So, why the 3 stars? Oh, because it took 90 minutes for our food to come. It got pretty frustrating watching people sit down after us, eat, and pay the bill as we sat and twiddled our thumbs. We actually didn't twiddle- we drank. And got drunk before the food came. Classy.

Our server was a nice dude- he took 10% off the bill... but I'm pretty sure he forgot to put our food in.

Ultimately, I WILL be back because this place is the cutest. I am sure I'll have a better experience next time."
"PA","If I lived here in Pittsburgh I would probably frequent this place. Really good comfort food and a full service bar. This seems like a place you come where everybody knows your name.

I like those kinds of places.

The reviews match my experience here, a definite must if you're in the area."
"PA","I have heard good things about this place so I had to give it a try. My friends and I went there for lunch and got seated right away. We received our drinks and ordered promptly. That's about the last thing that happened promptly. 

Our food took about 30-45 minutes to come out and once we finished, in a hurry to get back to work, we had to wait a good 20-30 minutes to get the check. It seemed we were on the tale end of lunch so everyone was running around doing other things other than getting our check so we can get out. Lunch from sitting down to leaving was more than 1.5 hrs which is a little long in my opinion.

Okay now that I got that out of my system let me say that I had the Open Face Roast Beef Sandwich and it was the best open face gravy soaked sandwich I have ever had. The roast beef was tender and soft and the gravy had a really good flavor. 

They had a very good beer selection and they have the largest selection of Scotch I have ever seen. It's impressive! To say the least. 

The downside to pipers is that the selection and good food comes at a cost. They rarely have specials or good happy hour specials so be prepared to pay full price for everything on tap and on the menu. 

I give them 4 Stars despite their service because I feel the poor service was a fluke and their beer and Scotch selection is pretty epic. That combined with the delicious food and it's a winning combination."
"PA","Sunday brunch here is a definite WIN.  If you've never had boxty, go here and try it!  Imagine an omelet incased in potato pancake.  Brilliant!  

The atmosphere is a bonus, too.  Football (not the 'Merican kind) fans watching games all morning and afternoon.  You won't feel strange at all about ordering an IPA at 10:00am with your brunch.  Then finish brunch off right with an Irish Coffee. 

Also a generally great bar to stop by for a beer most nights (can get a bit crowded on weekends, though).  Oh, and get some Scotch eggs while you're there!"
"PA","I wanted to love this place based on the awesome reviews. I really did. We came here for my birthday back in June, and I was pretty pumped to get the shepherd's pie since I became pretty obsessed with it in London and previous reviews said they had good stuff here. It was a huge portion, and I was surprised by how big was. The flavor, however, was bland and nothing like I expected. My partner in crime had bangers and mash and had no complaints. The experience was so-so, and without a flavorful shepherd's pie to lure me in, I don't think we'll be back. I was really hoping for an authentic shepherd's pie, but alas, didn't find it here."
"PA","This place was a whim for us and 4 friends of ours who met in town for a wedding and it was a wonderful choice, they had many vegetarian options which is always a plus and makes me like a place even more, first things first, the service was amazing! He was recommending beers for us right off the bat and they had a huge selections, if you didn't know what you wanted, he would bring you a favorite of his and it was always delicious. I ordered the fish and chips of course, it's a pub and it was wonderful, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Highly recommended"
"PA","A really nice place to find good food.  The staff was pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu and took the time to tell us about the various dishes.  Will go there again the next time I'm in the 'Burg."
"PA","Cozy pub with some traditional Irish fare on the menu."
"PA","My boyfriend and I came here for dinner. We have read good things about this place and were really looking forward to it. The atmosphere was great and the server was nice; though she was the only one working so the service suffered. 

I ordered the chicken shepard's pie and my boyfriend ordered the beef shepard's pie. Our food did not come out for at least 30 minutes but it was nice and hot when it came. My dish was thicker with less gravy and my boyfriends dish was filled with gravy. Other than missing the gravy they both tasted good. 

Even though this experience was average,  I might give it another go because I have read such good things!"
"PA","Great place.  No real complaints ever at Pipers.  A great beer and whisky list and their pub burger is amazing.  
Do yourself a favor and go to Pipers for a futbol game and enjoy the potent potables and good food."
"PA","If you live in pgh and haven't been to pipers, you are a jagoff. There are a few hit or miss items, but when it's on it's on @ pipers."
"PA","This a favorite place for friends and I to hang out.  The food is delicious if you're looking for something light and fluffy though, I wouldn't suggest eating here.  While they have a fantastic selection of draft brews, I must say my favorite draft of theirs is their root beer.  MMM mmm MMM.  How many places have root beer - on draft?  None that I know of - and it's delicious.  Everyone should try it.  Their pot pie is pretty splendid as well."
"PA","Morning Drinker? Well, this is the place to go.. They open early during the weekends.

The service is pretty good. They have great Breakfast (try the english or the irish) and offer some good selection of beer.

Would definitely go back again!"
"PA","Stopped by while in Pittsburgh for work, and while many items on the menu caught my eye, I couldn't get past the lamb and roasted chestnut shepherd's pie. In retrospect, a huge plate of meat and potatoes wasn't the ideal meal to order on a sweltering summer evening, particularly since the dish comes straight off the broiler to you and is guaranteed to raise the temperature of your table 20 degrees. While I can't say that the chestnut flavor was strong, the entire dish was well seasoned, hearty, and completely delicious. And for under $10, it's a lot of food for your dollar. I also appreciated the beer selection and thought the atmosphere was cozy.  Great place!"
"PA","Went there on an early Tuesday evening. Service was slow. My husband's sherpars pie was overcooked and loaded with pepper. My fish & chips were almost burnt. I had to ask for drink refills and dessert was never offered. I went here because of the great reviews but I won't be back."
"PA","After reading all of the beaming reviews on this place and checking out the (frequently upkept) website, I took my parents here for Sunday brunch.

I got the fish and chips. The fish itself was great, but not as hot and crisp as it could have been. It'd probably been sitting under the lamps for too long. The fries were the same bland frozen fry you'd get at any other restaurant in existence, which was disappointing. My dad really enjoyed his huge open face beef sandwich, and my mom found the banger sandwich bland with too much bread. Mashed potatoes were great, and so was the whiskey gravy.

Everyone's right about the 4 onion soup. Get it. It's amazing. I could've used more cheese crouton, but I'm also a glutton. 

I tried a bite of the coleslaw, flavorless. And I think there was something wrong with their tap system when we came in. Our Harp had no head, and neither did the Guinness at the next table. Not okay. 

I can appreciate that their website has an updated beer and whiskey list with prices. And that they don't go too far with the theme. And giant portions for reasonable prices. It was a 'miss' this time, but I'd love to come back again and try the shephard's pie or the Guinness stew. Hopefully they can poor a proper pint next time around."
"PA","Excellent British food, exceeded our expectations (and I'm half British so I know good authentic British food). Portions were very generous (two adults could easily split the fish and chips), but beer was expensive (2 local beers for $11.50) and the lighting was a bit dim. 

I had the chicken and mushroom pie and it was DELISH! Highly recommend if you need a British food fix and can't get across the pond..."
"PA","Love me some Pipers! Best fish sandwich in the city.  I also love that you have Helltown on tap!"
"PA","I PROMISE you, you'll love the food and the atmosphere in this place. It's a bar, very casual, and there's 'football' on TV (known as soccer to us). If you get Tommy as your server, you'll have a great experience and you'll get good food recommendations from him. Good beer selection, and for apps the Scotch Eggs and Red Pepper and Artichoke Dip are great! I went with a group of friends and we all ordered something different so we can taste as much as possible. Bar none the best things we ordered were the Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepherd's Pie, and the Chicken and Mushroom Pie. Come hungry because the plates are HUGE. I'm definitely going to become a regular here."
"PA","Zucchini curry is great.  I might just really like pubs, but the vibe here is perfect..."
"PA","Went here with a group of friends because we had heard from someone that they have the best burger in town. So of course a bunch of us ordered the Pub burger with Stilton cheese and bacon. It wasn't one of the best burgers I've ever had, but it was pretty good. Crispy on the outside, moist, flavorful - I just wish it were less well done and a little juicier in the middle. Fries were just OK. 

BUT the Scottish ale gravy on the lamb sheperd's pie had some definite wow factor. I would come back just for that dish."
"PA","Have you ever read the book (or seen the film) ""Alive""? You know, where the rugby team crashes in the Andes, and while freezing to death, they are forced to eat their dead in order to survive?

Well, I think that rugby team should probably have just brought along Piper's Pub's Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepherd's Pie. Because it is the absolute perfect winter meal, and then they could've avoided that whole cannibalism thing. 

For only about $10 at Piper's, you'll get a huge, hearty serving of the most rich, flavorful, lamb stew you've ever had, topped with crispy potatoes, and filled with even more. This one delicious, piping-hot bowl will sustain you for days. If you eat the whole thing, I promise you won't even have any room left for the guy who was sitting in 7C."
"PA","Piper's is really a one-of-a-kind pub in the heart of South Side. It's the only place that you'll find open at 7 AM on a Saturday for the earliest soccer games. It's the confluence of family-friendly atmosphere, young professional hangout, punk attitude, and rowdy soccer fandom.

Don't be fooled by the pub's unassuming looks. The food at Piper's is tops in the South Side...and I'm not just talking bar food. From Sunday brunches to Tuesday night vegan specials, Piper's takes all of it's food seriously, and you taste the quality.

For my money, this is where you'll find the best fish and chips in Pittsburgh. Some of my Irish friends would argue this with me, but I'm sticking to it. It's a great place for hearty meals like Guinness stew and Shepherd's Pie, but you'll also find filling and delicious items of slightly ""lighter"" fare. The hot pepper smoked turkey sandwich, housemade black bean burger, and the sweet potato po' boy are all some of my favorites, but nothing tops the brunch for me.

Stop in on Saturday or Sunday for an Irish boxty, and you'll be set for the day. If you haven't experienced a boxty, seriously give it a shot. Saturdays, they have special boxty and you'll often see Monday lunch specials using boxty, like a pulled pork boxty. Brilliant stuff. Sunday brunch also offers some excellent french toast.

From typical bar food, to sandwiches and burgers, to full-on entrées, Piper's does a solid job.

As for the beer, Piper's takes pride in picking out excellent choices of craft brews, supporting some of the more local breweries. Their selection of cask and draft beers are something worth paying attention to, as they don't last long. You also will be hard-pressed to find a better pint of Guinness in the area.

In the end, Piper's is a great, low-key place to catch your favorite soccer games (if you're a fan), get a great, reasonably-priced meal, and enjoy some quality beer. The scotch selection is serious, but as someone who's not into scotch, I'll leave that to the more knowledgeable. See you there!"
"PA","Now that I have a little bit of faith in America's ability to produce a few good British restaurants, I'm determined to try as many as possible. My husband and I ate at Piper's Pub on a Tuesday night between Christmas and New Years, and it turned out to be perfect cold-weather comfort food. 

Our recent method is to order a palette of different dishes to share, and it was some tough deciding with Piper's huge menu. We at last chose the fish & chips with a side of curry sauce, Welsh vegetarian sausages and the Gaelic four onion soup. I was also tempted by the full English breakfast but will have to try it next time.

The fish & chips were good but definitely more American style. The vindaloo sauce was great with the chips but at medium too hot for my dulled tastebuds after living in Oklahoma for half a year. The Welsh sausages were new to me, so I can't speak for their authenticity, but they were delicious and served with a sweet apple chutney that complemented the savoriness quite well.

The onion soup was by far my favorite, described as ""caramelized leeks, scallions, red and white onions de glazed with English Pale Ale and finished with a Stilton cheese-crusted crouton."" I can honestly say I tasted a hint of everything in that list, unlike many restaurants that exaggerate with descriptions. Even the little bit of Stilton cheese on top was memorable!

The drinks menu was extensive, with an entire list of Pennsylvania draughts. 

Our server was warm and friendly, and he got us out of there in record time when we mentioned we were running a bit late for the Penguins game at Consol.

Definitely a new cold-weather favorite."
"PA","I've never been out of the country, so I'm a sucker for ""authentic"" places that can make me feel cool.  Piper's Pub makes me feel cool.  The waiter reminded me of Gerard Butler (in accent, not appearance, sorry!) and the menu was a friendly mix of American classics and Irish meals.  Me and my boyfriend both went for the Irish food. 
My Shepherd's Pie was fantastic, topped by this flakey, beautiful carb-thing that made the dish. Boyfriend said his bangers and mash was lackluster, but I tried it and I called him a liar.  Just needed salt. 
I ordered a fancy sounding stout and was disappointed to reach the limits of my ability to blend into the Irish dining experience - it was much too bitter and dark for me.  I wasn't able to finish it, but I'm still glad I tried it.

We went when it was pretty busy, and I would've loved to ask the waiter questions about the beer, but he was running around like a crazy man.  Oh well, I guess their job is to serve, not to entertain a beer-novice's questions."
"PA","Been there once and can't wait to go back!  Had the Shepherd's pie...so good for a chilly Pittsburgh day!!!  Also had the curry vindaloo as an appetizer - WOW!  I am not typically a fan of spicy things but this totally rocked!!!!"
"PA","I can see why 50 other folks love this place! Quite the find. 

Wholesome, hearty, beefy, Brit-inspired fare. This is rib-stickin' food, my friends. Fries on salads, scotch eggs, proper English AND Irish brekkies served anytime, Guinness stew, shepherd's and their pies, chicken & mushroom pastry...and, a VEGAN BLACK BURGER. Yes, the geniuses behind Piper's Pub though of just about everyone, even the vegans. Well done, well done. Also, a whole mess of sandwiches, etc. 

Yes, the food is excellent enough to stand on its own, but what truly makes this place shine is the service. As soon as we entered we were greeted warmly, equipped with a wifi password (he saw me checking my phone, checking in of course!) without even asking, plus a story to boot (ask the owner about ""Yo Pipes!""). Waters and hot teas arrived swiftly as did menus. Our lunching partners joined us, we all ordered and from start to finish the service was utterly flawless. We had no less than 3 gentlemen taking orders, delivering food, refilling waters, checking on our happiness, etc. All just seemed to totally have their shit together and like being alive. This is rarity in the biz, these guys got it. This place has roots, and one of them seems to be treating guests like proper guests

And making them wish they'd worn stretchy pants. 

On a last second whim, I went with the full English Breakfast. Baked beans, bangers (sausages), 2 eggs over easy and thick cut toast all heaped onto a plate. It arrived in all of its glory, HOT, delicious and exactly what I wanted. It kept me full for approximately 9 hours (the entire drive to NYC) and I consumed about 1/4 of it. This stuff is for REAL. I'd say you might want to think about sharing plates due to the huge portions, but the food is so darned good I just recommend ordering your own and taking home leftovers. It's worth it. 

The lunch hour was a comfortable busy and I left with a warm, fuzzy feeling. Yes, I was full...but really, Piper's is the bomb. Yo Pipes! Indeed. 

HUGE lunch for 4, no booze + tip: $60."
"PA","They've really got their shiz together!  I can't complain about a single thing!  The service was A+.  Completely attentive and extremely friendly.  Food was excellent!  

I hadn't been to Pipers in a while so I felt like I needed another visit to properly review the place.  I got super excited about going there when I tried their Guinness Stew at an event last week so I was set on ordering that because it was so delicious, even in a buffet style!  But then at the last minute changed my mind, being tempted by the Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepherd's Pie.  It was so savory!  The Scottish Ale gravy was so thick and tasty and those crispy potatoes on top?  It was like icing on top of a delicious cake!  I am NOT one to forget about the sweet things in life, but this was such a hearty meal that there was no way I could have eaten dessert after such a hearty meal.  

Now I can't wait to go back and sample some more delicious meals and have a nice English ale to boot!"
"PA","Is it just me? Seems every time I come here some local who doesn't own an inside voice comes to chat up a seated guest. . . Shhh it's morning time"
"PA","Love coming here for morning bagels. The manager is always funny and nice. Just a walk away from my place so might as well enjoy it. I've never gotten a wrong order in the past 2 years."
"PA","2 out of 3 times you come to this location the order is wrong.  Today I ordered a sausage egg and American cheese bagel on a plain bagel and a plain bagel w cream cheese.  Simple enough, right?  First order was a plain bagel w sausage and jalapeño cream cheese and second was onion bagel w egg.  Not even close, and I was the only one in line.  I won't go into the response I received when going to the counter, but it wasn't pleasant.  Only other thing I will say is that their furniture is all over the place w chairs strewn everywhere leading to a less than decent atmosphere.  Only go if desperate for food and or hungover."
"PA","Tim the manager is great. Always chatting you up as he makes your meal and making it fun."
"PA","Pricey, but the salads are good.

It's not that the bagels cost a lot or anything they're just priced more like a movie theater.  You just don't expect a salad and a large lemonade to run $10 but it does at brueggers.

That said the food is generally on the better end of quality for fast food and the staff here are polite and attentive.  

If you're watching calories and work on the southside there aren't many options that work.  This is one of them."
"PA","I walked into the office this morning (with slight post-Super Bowl haze) and quickly realized that it was my turn to bring in breakfast.  D'OH!   Panic mode.  The good folks at Bruegger's on the Southside helped me to recover with an amazing quick turnaround after my high-speed jaunt across the Birmingham Bridge.  Excellent bagels and some other options like muffins, cookies, great sandwiches and more.  I love the fact that these bagels taste like ""real bagels"" compared to Panera.  I also love the fact that they have Smoked Salmon cream cheese (even though I might be in the minority on that one)!   Thanks Bruegger's - I got hammered and harrassed by co-workers but it could have been worse."
"PA","Ran in and got myself some quick take-out as I was running around town

Bacon, Egg, and Chees on a toasted onion bagel
Ham, Egg, and Cheese on a toasted onion bagel

The bagels were rubbery, but not as much as the egg.  It is amazing what can happen at different stores in the same chain.  I must say, I wasn't hungry after I was done."
"PA","I LOVE Bruegger's Bagels.  I wish they would come to Chicago.  Regardless of the time of day, I order the same thing, the turkey sandwich with garlic cream cheese and dried tomato spread.  So good, I wish I had one right now.  My cousins thought I was odd for wanting to come here, but I told him to take a bite of my sandwich and yes, indeed, he did agree, it was good.  Friendly service and spacious seating all added to another great Bruegger's experience."
"PA","Okay, I've gotta upgrade this one to five stars.  I was here on Friday thrifting with my friend Maryann.  We were going through the racks of used clothes and other assorted consignment goodies, not having much luck, when he happened upon some used DVDs.  And there it was.

I'd nearly forgotten all about that show, but I used to watch it all the time when I was a teenager.  I didn't even know it was on DVD and I wondered who the hell would be getting rid of such a treasure.

For those of you who don't know, ""Parker Lewis"" was an inventive early Fox TV show that paved the way for such later fare as ""Malcolm in the Middle"" (only without that show's nastiness) and ""Scrubs"".  I remembered how it was primarily a single-cam show with lots of fast edits and sound effects.  I remembered how it had odd colors in places and its quirky humor.  I remembered that Parker Lewis and his buds Mikey Randall and Jerry Steiner used their wit, some gadgetry, and their general cool to negotiate the world of high school.  Parker would pull some stunts on the show, but they were generally out of kindness and a desire to help his fellow students.  And if he just happened to promote himself doing so, so much the better.  

But what I'd forgotten was how it was an important bridge between the 80s and 90s.  It went from pastels to grunge.  And it's a riot seeing some of the gadgets they used--VHS tapes, two way radios (remember, no cel phones), analogue TVs, cassettes and reel-to-reel tapes!  Doesn't make the show any less enjoyable watching it 20 years later.  Oh yeah, and the catchphrases:  ""Not a problem"", ""Mental note"", and my favorite, ""Synchronize Swatches""!

Coolness!"
"PA","This Goodwill is the primary place I get work slacks.  Thank you donaters for allowing me to dress for success for less! 
They have racks of slacks, khakis, blue jeans, skirts, dresses and shirts.  Waiting for a dressing room can take forever, but there's nothing you can do about it, so just look at the 70's ties while you wait.  There's a reasonable selection of shoes and accessories, as well as home wares and electronics.
In addition to hunting for Halloween costumes, they also have a decent selection of holiday decorations that are fun to pick through."
"PA","A decent Goodwill.  There are a lot of rows of clothing for you.  I did manage to find some name brands tucked away amidst all of the Old Navy, Target and Walmart brands...for example, I did find some okay Banana Republic, Ann Taylor LOFT, Guess, Armani Exchange, etc.  However, if you really want to find cute, high quality clothing, be prepared to dig.  Luckily, this Goodwill organizes clothes (usually) by size with colored tags.  They also have a flat rate pricing for stuff unless it's considered a special find. There are also two small dressing rooms and a bathroom for your convenience. All in all, a decent Goodwill that requires some patience to find the right stuff for you :-)"
"PA","Goodwill is well known as a place where you can get used, newer clothes in good condition.  But did you know that it can be the perfect place to get your Halloween costume?  I was searching for a polka dot dress 'cos I was dressing up as Minnie Mouse for Halloween.  And lo and behold I found one here in my size.  

Of course I was Minnie Mouse because this past weekend, my husband Rick and I took our niece and nephew out to Idlewild Park.  On Halloween proper, Minnie's sluttier sister Maxine Mouse will appear!"
"PA","I lived near this place for two years and almost never bought anything. Eventually I just stopped going. This is the Goodwill that everybody goes to, so you're not going to find anything here. And I hate that they make you check all bags. Usually, I just walked past because inevitably I had a bag with me."
"PA","Just got back from the Goodwill Store.  Me -n- the Girl Posse (my friends Marla, Sherry, and Maryann) just kind of headed over here, spur-on-the moment.  We weren't really looking for anything in particular.  I did find a few used books I'd like to have.  But then again, I remembered the words I told myself, ""No more used books, Susan, until you read the ones you've already bought.""  Boy, that Susan D. sure spoils all of my fun!"
"PA","Between the two major Goodwill Stores in the 'Burgh--the other one is on Ohio Street--this seems to be the better one.  Parking here is a little tight--the lot is very small for this size store.  

On the upside, this store is very well organized.  They usually have stuff according to size.  The menswear is very well organized  and extensive.  On the downside, you do have to do a lot of poking around to find what you are looking for--especially if you are into vintage dresses like I am.  This isn't so much a haven for vintage wear.  I would imagine that in tough economic times as these, people come here more and more just to find everyday wear.

They do have a good selection of used books.  I bought ""East of Eden"" from John Steinbeck here for $1.00 and an old copy of ""David Copperfield"" by Charles Dickens for 75 cents."
"PA","The things I take home from this store tend to be newer items in fair-to-good condition. This is not a good store for vintage or unique clothes. The prices skew fair to high. 

The dress selection is pretty extensive, and seems to be a treasure trove if you're looking for the kindergarten teacher jumper-style of dress. The furniture and housewares section is kind of worthless- most things I like are priced beyond my ""flinch point"" at this goodwill. They definitely have a concept of the ""value"" of items, and price accordingly. There is rarely cute furniture, but I did score a beautiful metal vintage cabinet (that appeared to be... i can't verify the origins) straight out of a 1950s science classroom for $10. 

They do have a private lot, which fills up kind of quickly. It's a giant pain because parking is so scarce over there by SS Works. I am curious to see how long this GW can last across the street from that upscale strip mall experience. 

Worth a note: this is the motherload of all goodwill dumpsters, but you will have to do some scaling/crawling (under/over tall fences) with a careful lookout stationed on carson to avoid being ambushed & caught. Ive seen several working bikes come out of that dumpster."
"PA","This is my favorite Goodwill of the ones I've been to.  It is pretty large and well spaced out.  The clothes are organized by size and type of clothing, and there is a decent variety.  There are some name brands, and some great finds, but it is still a game of chance.  If all else fails, they have a lot of books that are in a nice nook to choose from.  The 'stuff section' is a little messy, but I'm in it for the clothes.  They also have some overstocks from Target to spice things up.  You do have to be careful about the parking which is either in a tiny lot which is often full, or on the street.  If I park on the street I use it an excuse to grab some food in the area or to go shopping at the stores in the 'Southside Works' across the street.  I hope this place can keep up its variety with more and more people shopping here for a good find."
"PA","Come here to pan for gold! Well, maybe bronze...or brass...

Thrift shops of the new millennium tend to first get raided by other trendy-thrift stores, savvy fashionistas, and hipsters trying to avoid the Urban Outfitters look. ... annnnnnd the crumbs are left for us. But on occasion, you find store that appears promising!

Come through the double doors with an open mind, and an 'everything to gain' attitude. You might leave empty handed, or you might leave with a bag full of goodies. I was lucky enough to drop in for their 1/2 off sticker sale, and walked out with a darling vase, denim skirt, super cool carpet/travel bag, and a new umbrella...all for under $10. I can't say this store is always a sure thing, but it's worth passing by from time to time..."
"PA","A great thrift store.  I discovered a lot of neat treasures here including a small collection of interesting T-shirts, a pair of blue Diesel sneakers that fit me perfectly, and a pocket reference book containing a bizarre set of numerical tables.

Also I bought a set of shot glasses here that did not have the name of some city frosted on the side but instead are just plain clear glass as shot glasses should be."
"PA","This Goodwill is a *little* better than other Goodwills I've been too. The clothes here are more modern and stylish and the crowd that shops here is younger. This store is small so I would recommend coming at least once a week to check for ""new"" items."
"PA","Goodwill Sucks! They are not out to help anyone, especially the homeless! They are FOR PROFIT! Do not even try to order from them online! Garbage!"
"PA","I had such a great experience here! I was on the prowl for some good novelty T-shirts for the summer; plus, I wanted to look at the couches because I'm moving to a new place in a couple of weeks. They had a really great selection. I almost even bought one of the couches that was in really good shape, but I would have had to pick it up in 24 hours and I wouldn't have been able to do that (although I might come back for it).  And the staff was super friendly and helpful- that is uncommon at a thrift store. After I had scoured through everything and got an armful of stuff, I walked up to the woman at the counter and we chatted for a bit. She even gave me a student discount (which I didn't even know that they had) even though I didn't have my ID card. I got 10 T-shirts, 2 pairs of pants and 2 sweaters all for about $35. I can't wait to come back, and I might even come back soon to pick up that couch!"
"PA","If you want to know what was popular in Pittsburgh a few years ago, I recommend the t-shirt racks at the Southside Goodwill. You can, of course get your fill of Penguins, Pirates and Steelers shirts, but  there's something super-entertaining about the shirts for college orientations long over, proms already celebrated, days of thanks for EMS staff (""I save lives every day, and all they gave me was this t-shirt"" - I'm not sure that's as appreciative as their employer intended), and local festivals I hadn't heard of until they were over.

I go for the good selection of clothing in decent condition, plus lots of other great, less essential finds. I stay for the entertainment value of the t-shirt racks, every time."
"PA","Nuts to hitting Macy's or Target for after -Christmas sales (although I did do that).  Hitting up Goodwill is the way to go!  And because it'd been awhile since we did some serious thrifting, my friend Marla and I came here looking for some bargains.

And find good bargains we did!  I found a beautiful Ralph Lauren cotton blazer.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  First of all, who gets rid of a Ralph Lauren?  Second of all, who'd ever expect to find one at Goodwill?  You'd expect to see something like that a good consignment shop.  Marla found some gorgeous sweaters for herself.  

Sometimes it pays to really poke around in a place like this!"
"PA","This Goodwill is bright, well-organized and fairly clean. I made some great finds especially in housewares and electronics. There is ample free parking which is very important in this area! I found some kitchen appliances with all parts and their original boxes. The pricing is reasonable."
"PA","I wanted books. Everyone said how great this place was for books. NO. It really isn't. Very few, a shelf that spans a wall that it shares with VHS, DVDs and crates of useless vinyl (I collect that too). I found six books that interested me and let me tell you they were hard as hell to find- they just threw books on that shelf, no categorization, alphabetical order? You're out of luck. Good for everything I didn't want. Useless for bibliophiles. It's cheap but you can get books cheap from the Carnegie Libraries. Save your money and go there."
"PA","I am giving these guys three stars, its a large store sometimes they get good furniture items. I am guessing if you came by on their days new truckloads are brought in you could find some good stuff. 

I don't go here all of the time but have found some good clothing for clients here, at good prices. I stop in from time to time just to see what they have. I also really like what Goodwill does for the community in the Southside they offer jobs and job training programs for people with low income and special needs. They also have other various social service resources. So the charity factor is high for me here. 

Antique factor: 2/5 never seen any beauties here but you could one day. 

Thrift factor 4/5 most prices are on point. 

Customer Service 5/5: always been helpful staff here when I needed anything."
"PA","pretty high turnover of furniture and housewares.  still looking for a bookshelf."
"PA","I love you Goodwill.

You would think that would be a good enough review, wouldn't you?

This Goodwill location on the SouthSide is amazing.  I love it because of how you can pull up and drop off your donations, then swing your vehicle in a spot and then go into the store and browse.  Take a deep breath, that mixture of old, warmth, and donated is the scent of Goodwill.

When I said browse before, I hope you have at least a hour to browse.  It's part of the experience.  If you don't have time to browse plan to come on a day you can just putz around in the store and not have to be in a rush to head out to work or something.  Wouldn't want you to miss out on an awesome shirt, or maybe that coffee table you've been looking for is sitting there, or maybe somebody donated a CD you've been searching forever for.

Take your time here.  And if you plan on coming here, take time at home to clean out that closet, make room in your dresser, sneak out a gift you really didn't want from last Christmas, then bring it with you, donate, then shop!

Oh, good tip: don't forget to ask for your tax receipt when you donate, every penny counts nowadays."
"PA","Came in here with my mom from CA on a whim. We knew the thrift stores of SF set the standard (seriously, they're amazing!) so we really weren't expecting much. However, within a few minutes, I already had a few nice things in my basket - a genuine leather CHANEL pursue for $7.99, a black lace dress for $4.99, a floral summer dress for $4.99, navy blue J.Crew shorts for $2.99, black slipons from Ann Taylor Loft and a few cute blouses. I tried things on, tossed some and kept some. I was really impressed by the selection, how organized it was, and it even smelled really nice upon entering. The woman at the checkout, Patty, is so sweet and we chatted for several minutes. Upon checkout, she also gave me a 10% discount as a student, even for my mom's stuff,too! 

Excellent goodwill, very pleased and definitely plan on going back!"
"PA","While shopping in the South Side Flats area, I also stopped in the Goodwill store.  

I went in hoping to find a toaster... yes, yes, I know it was a gamble.  In fact, they didn't have much at all in the way of any small appliances.  

However, I did find some other goodies though.  They had a great selection of women's shoes, gently worn.  If only I wore a 10 or a 7... drat!  Next time.  I also spotted a skirt I liked but one size too small.  

The store was clean and well organized -- every shirt and skirt on the racks were perfectly hung and the quality of the clothing and shoes I scanned through was quite good."
"PA","I want to commend the Goodwill for all the good work they do for the disabled, handicapped, mentally challenged and really anyone who needs a helping hand. This location sales about anything you would need, from clothes to shoes, mattresses and dishes. Oh and books!  There was a period of my life when I utilized the Goodwill driving services, which is a driving school. Their rates back there were $50.00, for an hour of instruction. Way cheaper than any comparable driving service that I could find at that time.  The instructor was an older gentlemen who was patient."
"PA","I'm a full on total spoiled brat when it comes to thrifting. I grew up in a town where the Salvation Army was organized by size, color, and even down to TYPE of shirt.

That said, this Goodwill is NOT that. It's barely organized into shirts and pants. 

I don't want to be too tough on them. I have found some pants gems. (Not bedazzled jeans, not those types of gems.)

It's sort of dirty and you can smell the toilet pretty much all over the store. Just don't expect department store level cleanliness or organization, keep your head down, look for the deals, and have cash on you. More than once I've been there and they couldn't take cards for some reason."
"PA","Great store at a great location with it's own private parking lot.  I have usually gotten lucky here, since hipsters and the rich people of point breeze, squirrel hill, and ShadySide dump off last season's clothing.  
Plus they accept donations in their parking lot also, which is convenient during spring and fall cleaning!
Plus, since my weight loss/tone up journey from last year, I frequent there every time I drop a Jean size.  I can usually get lucky and find a decent pair of Express or American Eagle jeans if I look long enough.  :-)"
"PA","I was starving and between errands so stopped in for a quick chicken fried rice. Disgusting. There was zero flavor... I added three packs of soy sauce to make it taste like something. The chicken had a grayish color and no carrots, peas or egg. Only bean sprouts and onion, I ate about a quarter of it and pitched it. Never again. How hard is fried rice?"
"PA","I ordered the Garlic Chicken and it was delicious, hot, fresh, flavorful and the chicken was tender. Large portions and inexpensive."
"PA","This restaurant is the middle of the shopping center with the Giant Eagle in the South Side.

Let me tell you, the enviroment is not a plus.  It's kind of like a fast food restaraunt atmosphere and it's not in the best area of town. 

I have eaten General Tso's chicken all over this country and it is the very best General Tso's EVER!  I order it extra spicy and it's amazing. I can't speak for the other food there, other than the egg rolls, rice and hot and sour soup are good too.  The General Tso's is so good though, I've never ordered anything else."
"PA","We dropped by the Inn-Termission Lounge on a trip back to our hometown, Pittsburgh.  We wanted to see what's changed since it was the Roxy, then owned by a delightful Eastern European couple, Wasyl ""Roxy"" and Anna.  Let's say, what's changed is a lot.

The Inn-Termission Lounge could be renamed ""Smoker's Paradise"".  Unless you are one, or don't mind throwing all your clothes in the machine and washing your hair when you get home.  There is a ""Smoking Permitted"" sign on the door so that should be enough warning.  Venturing inside, we saw a lively group of men seated along the bar chatting among themselves.  Knowing we weren't going to fit in, we looked at each other and left."
"PA","This place is terrible.  It's a dive bar that stinks and it seems like a funeral home.  

The draft beer made me sick.  It tasted like they hadn't cleaned the lines in years.  

My friends like to drink and they all walked out without finishing their drinks.  

Awful, close the place!!!

Thanks"
"PA","This place is HORRIBLE!!!

Inn-Termission Lounge is pretty much a dive bar in every aspect, except for drink prices. As noted in previous reviews, the drink prices would reflect those of an upscale club. Which this dump most definitely is not. As well, it's nearly impossible to get a drink from the bartenders. They will literally look right at you, and completely ignore you at the same time. Once you finally do get served (at one point, it took me 20 minutes to get a beer), it's like they've done you the biggest favor in the world by serving you. 

I have seen some places use increased drink prices to weed out ""riff-raff"". But it fails to work here. Countless homeless dregs wandered in and out of the place, right past the doorman. Then they hit total strangers up for a drink. I guess it's OK for them to come in, so long as they ask for drinks and not money? They also brought their dogs into the bar with them-which is a major PLCB violation. I was catching a show in the back room, and noticed a puddle on the floor. At first I thought someone spilled a drink. But then I saw that one of the homeless guys' dogs was squatting and urinating on the floor. Lovely. 

I like a good dive bar as much as the next guy. But NOT when I'm paying through the nose for a beer, going dry for 20 minutes at a time, and fending off unwashed vagrant. FAIL!"
"PA","So admittedly, I've only been to Inn-Termission at one specific time of the week, but it's always been entertaining.  On Saturdays from 4 to 8 (I believe, could be off by an hour) they cover up the pool tables in the back, rearrange the tables and chairs, and put on small blues bands and musicians.  And it's just a $2 for those four hours.

I agree with others that their drinks aren't especially cheap, but during that Saturday time frame it's a perfect spot to be for live blues music.  I've seen anywhere from a house band, that can rock for 15 minutes and kill it, to a solo act from out of town passing through but plying his trade.  The crowd there is definitely on the older side, and maybe a little rough looking, but they still know how to have a good time.  Enjoying the music comes first, having a cold drink is second, and some random bar conversations are a close third.  Some have even been friendly enough to buy a round of shots or drinks once you start talking.

So if you want to check out some decent blues for an hour or two on a Saturday afternoon before hitting up the rest of Carson, give Inn-Termission a try."
"PA","The Inn-Termission is a total dive, but it's in the thick of the Southside insanity. Don't expect dive bar prices, or that friendly dive bar service.

I've never been a huge fan of the service at the Inn-Termission. You'll often have the bartenders looking at you (or ignoring you completely) as if they're doing you a favor. Mondays are okay, as Tommy is working, and if you wander in when it's completely dead, your experience will be good. Just don't be surprised if service is a little frustrating if you're not a regular.

In the dive bar spirit, clean bathrooms (or clean anything, for that matter) don't exist, and smoking is permitted, so thumbs up if you're a smoker, but the rest of us will be thankful for the fresh air when we leave. There's often live music on hand, and certain Mondays have kung fu karaoke, where there's an old school kung fu movie playing on a projector behind you. It's supposed to be a great time, as a lot of my friends go, but I can't deal with the smokiness to start my week.

In the end, the Inn-Termission's name is pretty on-point. It's never going to be the place that you go as your primary stop for a night in Southside, but it's a decent option for a place to stop in and buy a drink on your way to your main destination or in between bar hop stops."
"PA","I'm not sure what this place is trying to accomplish anymore.  It has the appearance of a dive bar which I don't mind at all.  It is located in the South Side, a good place for a dive bar.  But yesterday I spent $4 for a domestic bottle (Duquesne Pilsner) which seems pretty steep for a place like this.  

The bartending is hit and miss whether it's busy or not.  Sometimes I get okay service but usually I feel like I'm mostly ignored.  But I keep going back because I think, ""This time will be better.""  And it's really not.  Sigh.  I'm not sure why I keep letting this place disappoint me."
"PA","Walked in to have a few drinks around 11pm and some old guy followed us into the bathroom and said ""Get the f-ck out of here"". We told him we were planning on staying for drinks not just using the bathroom and he still rudely insisted that we leave saying ""I've been dealing with this sh-t all night, get out"". May be owner? manager? or just drunk guy at the bar...? Whatever the case, awful experience, will never go back.
Amazing that a bar that doesn't want customers on a Saturday night is still in business."
"PA","This place has shockingly expensive drinks for an establishment that looks divey. That's why no one ever goes here. I'm not sure how they stay in business, but God bless them."
"PA","This is my favorite divey type bar in the south side.  I have been going here for at least 10 years and it's nice to go to a place and know exactly what you're gonna get.  This place is usually the last stop of a long night.  I found myself there last night once again closing the place out, which unfortunately due to my advancing age and mellowing tempermant I find myself doing less and less frequently, thus the impetus for me to document this fine establishment.  It's located on E. Carson St. next to the parking lot by the Pittsburgh Steak Company.  It's plenty big and most folks spend their time located at the long bar to the left after you enter.  In the back there is a pool table and a bunch of booth seating.  It's really a shame because this is a lot of wasted space for an E. Carson St. location.  They also have a fully operational kitchen in the back but don't expect a menu.  They may have served food long long ago, but do not now.  They did attempt to revive their kitchen about a year ago, but it didn't work out.  You'll mostly be snacking on bags of chips, crackers and beef jerky unless you luck out and Cindy is behind the bar and is willing to make you a burger on the small grill behind the bar.  If she is making burgers you should order one they are surprisingly good, either that or I'm usually tipsy enough to appreciate anything warm when I'm here.  All of there bartenders, cindy, billy, etc. are all great and have been there for years.  This is definitely a last stop destination and usually never super crowded.  The folks are a pretty wide mix, but after midnight mostly mid 20 somethings and 30 somethings with a few local older yinzers mixed in.  They have a couple of tv's (no plasmas) and you could do a lot worse than to watch the game here.  In fact during the last steelers superbowl run I found myself here often.  Also, the free ham bbq's aren't bad either.  This is not a place to order wine, but they do have a good beer selection including guiness on draught and a few imports.  They make a strong drink with most top shelf liquors available and the prices are cheap.  Again, this is a great place to end the night and often closing time is on their own schedule."
"PA","Before Pittsburgh area malls got a Hot Topic, East Carson St. was THE destination for all the ""Spirit of '77"" punks who'd sprung up across Allegheny County in the 90s and early 2000s. With two great thrift stores (buying used clothes = more beer/show/ciggie money) and the mighty boutiques called SWANK Gear and Slacker, the South Side was a Clash City Rocker's dream.

Slacker was always the larger of the two stores, and I'd hit it up last in my shopping rotation. I bought my staples at the thrift store, my Young Ones shirt  and awesome zipper skirt at SWANK, and hit up slacker for bags, pins, and accessories. The owner and employees were always really cool, loved to chat, stocked tons of flyers advertising shows near the front door, and didn't mind if you browsed. I remember buying tons of pins and belts and makeup and magazines and all that other stuff that a young lady buys when their college is giving her stupid amounts of money for purportedly being a good student, albeit one whose Mohawk put her perpetually in danger of being evicted from the Honors College.

Time marched on, and SWANK Gear closed, despite my best efforts to save it - which included: doing their ads, promoting it at punk brawls and bashes and gallery crawls of all kinds, buying up everything Kris, the owner recommended for me to wear. Although it had a much better clothing selection than Slacker - which is not a slam at Slacker, since SWANK Gear, in its day, was also head and shoulders above Zipperhead in Philly and Trash and Vaudeville in NYC - I think its location doomed it. As Kris pointed out, it was on a side street, tucked away from foot traffic, and Port Authority cuts combined with alarming headlines about the city's decline warned younger kids away from the South Side and pointed them toward the malls. Also, in a move that was unbeknownst to me - but which would become obvious five years later - developers were targeting the South Side for Williamsburg-style Californication, and would ultimately strip it of its small businesses, to replace them with artisinal foodie restaurants and national chains. 

Slacker has stood the test of time, defiantly resisting developer efforts to replace it with a Bank of America and restaurants serving locally-sourced free-range chicken breasts in duck confit with walnut-aoli ravioli, artichokes, and organic baby carrots in demi-glace. Or whatever those menus say. I'm a pizza-and-salad kind of gal. For that, for its great location, and for its awesome staff, I give it five stars, even though my punk days are nothing more but a handful of memories, photographs, and stories that begin with ""Back in the day..."" The next time you're tempted to hit up Hot Topic, skip it and go to the South Side instead. Check out the thrift stores for your threads and Slacker for your accessories. 

Oddly enough, while cleaning my apartment, I just found my Velvet Underground ""Peel Slowly and See"" pin, which I bought at Slacker more than 12 years ago. It is never leaving the lapel of my favorite black military jacket. Love ya, Slacker...and Andy and Lou!"
"PA","Carson Street staple with fun merchandise and reasonable prices.  I bought a great David Bowie t shirt there & some incense (not patchouli) ;-)"
"PA","Holy overpriced metal band t-shirt batman."
"PA","This place was stumbled upon after my son and I went to an incredibly cool toy store across the street, while on a walking tour of Carson & the Obey murals that were adorning a few of the buildings in the area.  

As was previously mentioned, it's a combination Hot Topic/Spencers, but it's an indie, and the owner is AWESOME.  I ended up having a 10 minute long conversation with him about his old days helping out Shepherd Fairey as he scouted locations for the Obey Murals and his history of stickering the city w/ the Giant sticker campaign.  They used to sell Obey prints for a mere $35 dollars, some of which are now worth over a thousand bucks.  He wasn't trying to ""name drop"", instead, just relaying old stories to someone like me who was obviously a fan of the brand.  

I bought a bunch of Obey stickers myself to take home and adorn my photo booth at work with.  Thanks for the courtesy Slacker, I enjoyed your store!

-Jake"
"PA","One of those little independent stores every city seems to have, that is a combination of Hot Topic, Spencer's, and an adult toy store. I enjoy going in even if I don't always buy something."
"PA","slacker smells like maaad incense.

they sell lots of good magazines that you don't see many other places. 
and they also have a large variety of hair dyes.
the clothes are alright. but that's just me. 
they have some pretty cool jewelry.

but i bought a ring for like 15 dollars there and it totally turned my finger green. i guess i should've asked first though... but oh well."
"PA","Extremely rude staff. We walked in at 11, when they open and the woman workings response was incredibly rude since we were there so early. She huffed and puffed as she turned on the lights, music, etc. Perhaps just a miserable person. Learn customer service."
"PA","Great sandwich place! I love the make your own deli sandwiches and the buffalo chicken sub! They also have a fun bar area with samplers! During the warm weather the patio is a perfect location - it sits off of Carson so even during the crazy nights you are away from the drunks and can enjoy your dinner and a beer."
"PA","Great beer selection and the food which is primarily deli sandwiches, is really good too! The staff is enthusiastic about the establishment and very well educated about their beers. I had the three pigs sandwich and it was delicious, and a great value for the money. It is not your typical Southside crowd of beer drinking kids. It is a bit laid back. The music is more likely to be Ella than Rihanna and you can talk and listen and enjoy good people and beer and food. What a concept!"
"PA","After reading the positive reviews, my colleague and I came in here for a drink, with the possibility of dinner.  The entire establishment had about 3 other people in here at 8pm on a Thursday.  Where was everyone?  

Seeing that they had a great variety of beers on tap (the main reason why we came), we decided to order 2 separate flights of 4 beers.  I gotta say, I'm a big fan of Levante Brewing Company.  Their maltier beers dominated my flight, and I really enjoyed the experience.  As with any flight, a few of the beers for both my colleague and I were hit or miss, but the 4 beer samples for $7 made it a worthwhile experience.  

We actually left without food because we wanted to seek out a place with a bit more atmosphere for dinner.  I would definitely come here for a quiet place to sample beers!"
"PA","The beer selection is great, bottle selection also great. Not as big as Atlas in Lawrenceville but still vast and unique, their 6 pack deals can't be beat as far as price goes. $2 off per bottle. Sandwiches are affordable and good of course and the draft selection is as well. Cool atmosphere and great aesthetic. Not really sure about hours though, door says they close at 11 but they started closing up at 10 and it got a little weird."
"PA","I've been living in southside for a few years and as a moderate food junkie, I stumbled into this place over the summer. I was craving buffalo chicken and decided to order the Montezuma's Revenge which was life changing. To this day I visit CSD every single Wednesday for their excellent craft beer tasting that feature some of the best breweries from around the country! My girlfriend loves this place as well and is determined to order every type of sandwich in slider form. Not too mention the extremely friendly and knowledgeable service provided by the staff and owner (Mike). After you're done enjoying a 5 star dinner and craft beer lecture and tasting, you can't leave without indulging in the vanilla bourbon cheesecake. This restaurant is not only a gem for southside but a gem for all of Pittsburgh. Already looking forward to next Wednesday! -J"
"PA","Really good sandwich shop. Tried their cheesy beefy for a quick lunch and it was delicious. I would reccomend it to anyone walking in the door.  If youre a beer drinker they have good drafts on tap with a decent selection of 6 packs to go. No liquor though."
"PA","Even if you're not conveniently located to the South Side, it would be well worth your time to check out Carson Street Deli! I've been there a handful of times. On my first visit, my boyfriend and I both ordered the Sicilian (to die for!). It reminded me of eating pepperoni pizza without all the grease and mess. We both loved it so much, we went back the very next day and tried something else (forget the name, but it was the same as the Sicilian but with salami). It was excellent, but I would still go with the Sicilian. Can't beat it!"
"PA","Just stopped in for the first time today to give Carson Street Deli a try. I had pretty high expectations coming in and thankfully I was not disappointed! I ordered the Balboa sandwich and it was pretty unreal. Being an Italian I was thrilled when I saw they had sopressata in the sandwich."
"PA","Best subs in Pittsburgh and one of the better craft beer refrigerators in town. Also they have the best vegetarian hoagie in town by far. Ask them to skip the black olives though. Unless that's you're into that type of thing."
"PA","I walk into this place and there's not one single soul in sight. I walk towards the back and find two women working what I assume is the deli section. I ask for a menu and she walks to the draft section and brings me back a paper pamphlet. I was craving soup but couldn't find any on the menu. They must have soup, after all this is a deli. I ask one of the women if and what soups they have. She mumbled something. I think she said there's only a little vegetable soup left. I expected a few options, broccoli and cheese or something at least. So I turn around and notice a couple coolers full of beer and bombers on shelves. But why waste the money? I know they're all overpriced like all Pittsburgh bars are. I'd be better off going draft, so I walk to the draft section. Once again I had to ask for something, this time a beer list. The lady walks to the deli section and brings me back the beer list. So the menu is in the draft section and the beer list is in the deli section? That's logical. I look over the list but it's literally all local beers. Maybe they are attracting tourists? Don't get me wrong, there are some great local beers, but us local connoisseurs have had all the greats. Boring. So I walk out. That's that. I was fascinated that not one person walked in throughout all of this being the middle of South Side and Wednesday lunch hours. I'm assuming all these reviews were from a Friday or Saturday night, and that's the only time I'm giving this place another chance."
"PA","I have only been here a handful of times, but it never disappoints. Today my boyfriend and I went and I got the chicken pitaza. Grilled chicken, mozzarella, pepperoni, marinara sauce in a pita. Phenomenal. I had one of the craft beers they had on draft too, one I had never heard of before, ephemere, a Belgian blonde with an apple flavor. Delicious. My bf got the three little pig sandwich. Pulled pork, ham and bacon on a baguette. I obviously had to try a bite and it was also amazing. Sandwiches so big, neither of is could finish! He had an IPA, good vibes by Voodoo Brewing. He enjoyed that. They have a decent size menu, mainly sandwiches (even stuff for the kids), some sides, soup & even salads. They had about 10 beers, maybe a few more, on tap. All of them awesome craft beers, including some great local ones for pittsburgh. They have a bottle craft beer selection too, you can do mix and match six packs to go. Not sure on the price, however. I have yet to have a bad experience here & now that I've got my boyfriend hooked, I know we will be going back soon!"
"PA","I went on my lunch break Tuesday.
Awesome lunch special! 1/2 sandwich (portions are ) and the linguini salad w/ a Budweiser! Beer selection is awesome. And they have an outside seating area with flowers! Going back soon. Try the Jay!"
"PA","The food was good and the atmosphere was cute for a deli. Upon the recommendation from the waitress I got the Bourne Farm and it was quite delicious. It was raining so I could not enjoy the beer garden out back, but I will certainly return to check it out."
"PA","Got a Reuben with some chili. The chili was good. Nothing to write home about, but not bad at all. The Reuben on the other hand...BEST. REUBEN. EVER. I always order a Reuben when I go to a sandwich shop, being that I'm a huge fan of them. This is by far the best I've ever had. I want to eat one everyday. For breakfast, lunch and dinner."
"PA","Three of us at in a southside office ordered BLTs with mayo in a takeout order this afternoon. For our $8 each we got a VERY THIN layer of VERY THIN bacon, no mayo, and bread that wasn't toasted. This was a lesson in how not to impress, and our return business is already lost. Fatheads and Primanti's have never let us down like this. If it weren't for this experience I would have gladly come by for a reuben or some of the other sandwiches (the menu LOOKS great), and a beer. Not so much anymore."
"PA","I love trying new places on Carson since I recently moved down there, and this spot did not let me down. I am sad that I didn't discover this gem sooner. I ordered their Italian sandwich with a side of cucumber tomato salad. The sandwich was absolutely delicious and packed with yummy meats. The salad also yummy and I ate every bit. I will for sure be back here and try more things on the menu."
"PA","The South Side is blessed to have such a good deli in the neighborhood.  It is good to either call ahead and pick up a sandwich, or eat there and enjoy the personable waitstaff.  The owner is very friendly (he'll talk your ear off if you ask him about different kinds of beer) and the beer selection is amazing!  I don't usually review restaurants on Yelp, but this one definitely deserves a five-star rating.  As for what to order, I'd suggest the ""Bourne Farm"" on marble rye!"
"PA","I got the Donnie brasco sandwich which was amazing. They had run out of the Italian bread so I had it on a baguette instead. I think it would be easier to eat on the Italian bread, but it was still delicious. My friend got the po' boy sandwich. We both agreed that it lacked crisp and had a not so pleasant fishy taste. We ended up just sharing my sandwich since it was so big. We also got a couple beers on tap that were delicious. If you are in the mood for a beer and sandwich I would totally check this place out."
"PA","I feel strongly that this place is great.   I have been here a couple times to eat, most recently to have a Reuben.  The sandwich was delicious with a  lot of meat.  I was concerned that the sandwich wasn't grilled.. At first I was put of by this but really it was very good like this. 

They have a decently size list of craft beers on draft, many of which are local. I love that for 7 bucks you can pick any 4 beers to samples in a little flight, which is a good way to try different beers.  
They also do beer sampling nights on Wednesdays which is fun.  ALSO, as far as beer goes, they have a very nice selection for build your own 6 pack.

Staff is friendly with quick service!  Overall a great place to have in the neighborhood, can't wait for it to get warm so I can sit in their ""beer garden""."
"PA","The pastrami sandwich was great, the gentleman with the cool mustache was great, could not partake in any of the craft beers, but the selection appeared to be great also.  The only reason I did not give the restaurant 5 stars is that the gentleman that rang me out was a Grouch!"
"PA","Let me start off by saying that I am not a huge craft beer person, I prefer wine and cider. However, I broke with tradition when I came here and ordered a beer and tried a few others. They have an incredible selection, and the bartender (a.k.a. ""the mustache guy"") is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I started with a french farmhouse style beer from Lavery Brewing Company in Erie, and it was delicious. I then of course reverted to my usual cider and had the bone dry from Arsenal, which is my absolute favorite cider. Ever. 

It's quaint inside, and when you walk in, the bar is the first thing you see on your left. As you keep walking, the place to order sandwiches is on the left, and then there is a large selection of bottled beers to take home on the right. You can make your own six pack, and there is a really good selection (this coming from the not a huge beer person-but don't worry, others have confirmed this).

I sat at the bar with friends and we ended up ordering sandwiches as well. I had the cheesy beefy, and I would certainly go back just for the sandwich! Perfectly beefy. Perfectly cheesy. Enough veggies on the sandwich to keep me from feeling too guilty.

My friends and I met the owner, who was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about craft beers. I look forward to coming back with friends, especially because it didn't have any of the ""seedy South-side feel"" that I desperately try to avoid.

Try this place for delicious beer and sandwiches!"
"PA","Solid 4 star spot. Very good sandwiches and fantastic brews. My delicate palette was satisfied. 

I'm from out of town and needed to find a place to bring my family of 10 people (nobody planned ahead). Found this place on yelp and everybody had a great time ! To boot we called 5 min in advance and it was fine."
"PA","I MUSTACHE you a question - Do you crave a tasty, fresh deli sandwiches?  Are you a craft beer connoisseur?  Well my friend, look no further than the Carson Street Deli & Craft Beer Bar.

Walk in to an excellent craft draft selection, including 2 Arsenal Ciders, along with a smiling mustachioed man who would be delighted to recommend a brew, pour you a pint, and get your grub grindin' ... Oh yeah - we didn't even get to that part yet!  

Right past the bar is an amazing deli counter where they make the tastiest of tasty sandwiches.  Everything is made fresh.  I want to try EVERYTHING on their menu!  This trip I selected the Donnie Brasco - A combination of Buffalo Chicken and Egg Salad on fresh Italian bread with your choice of Ranch or Bleu Cheese.  Yeahhhhhhhh I couldn't eat it all... I tried!  Did I mention every sandwich is served with a tasty dill pickle?  YUM!  

Oh and I had a Victory's DIPA to wash things down.  Mmm craft beer :)  Once we filled up with sammies and suds, we grabbed a 6pack to go and parted ways.  Yes, parting IS such sweet sorrow!!  If I can, though, I'll return tomorrow!!"
"PA","I attended the Yelp Event here last week and had a great time! The owner and his primary bartender (""the mustache"" guy) both had great personalities and kept the beer and cider samples flowing! They were also very knowledgeable about the beverages and displayed their expertise without sounding obnoxious.

I sampled five different beers and ciders but loved the Arsenal Cider Fighting Elleck the best. It really tastes more like champagne than cider which was delightful! I also tried a grilled cheese sandwich with a pumpkin cupcake made from a local bakery. The grilled cheese was perfectly melty and soft without being overly greasy. The pumpkin cupcake was moist and covered with a delicious buttercream.

The interior of the restaurant was much nicer than I had anticipated and elevates an establishment that sells beer, cider, and sandwiches. Even though this deli and bar is a bit out of the way for my husband and me, I hope we can come back again in the future!"
"PA","I knew I'd love the beer here. And I did!! We attended a Yelp event here last night and it was my first time to check this place out! I was really impressed with Mike and his wife who were extremely gracious hosts! Mike really knows his beer and provided a terrific introduction and tons of samples of some extraordinary beer! He prides himself on having beers on his 12 taps that you likely haven't seen or tried before. In fact, he said he bet that no one had heard of these beers. Well, he was close. I had a few of them before but the rest? He was right! And I headed right for the samples of those!! The local Lavery brew that had just won GOLD at the Great American Beer Festival was AMAZING!! So good!! What a great place to come sample some delightful craft brews in a welcoming environment!!

We ordered some food too - the Pastrami Mama was a delight and I would order that again!! Can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches (and get more of those pretzels and amazing beer cheese!) and to see what else he has in store on tap!! Mike is so knowledgable and eager to share his enthusiasm with other beer aficionados! Love it!!  A great place and worth a visit!!"
"PA","So i was at another Yelp event here where we got to meet the owner and discuss his restaurant but more importantly his knowledge of beers. 

Mike the owner was a great man to talk to. He knew exactly what beer to recommend with a certain foods or which beer was in high regard over another. We got to sample so many from IPA's to Stouts and Amber Ale's to Ciders. My Favorite was definitely the Dog fish Ksavir. Great taste, very smooth and almost like a wine. That is what he compared it to as well. After sampling many brews I chose the dog fish as my go to beer. I really wanted the lapery's stout but it was a little too like coffee for me. 

We ate some pretzels from the pretzel shop with some homemade beer cheese from his wife. Man was that beer cheese awesome. You could totally taste the beer but it wasn't over powering. The cheese had that aged sharp cheddar flavor which is one of my favorites. We got a small bowl for our table of five. There's something about sharing cheese between 20+ people that doesn't sit right with me. You never know who maybe double dipping ya dig? Anyway, we ordered a sandwich but I'm sad to say I wasn't to pleased with it.

it was the sicilian with prosciutto, capicola, ham, red peppers, oil and oregano and genoa salami. The bread was a baguette which was extremely hard so i couldn't  enjoy eating it like a real sandwich. It didn't come with veggie toppings other than the red peppers so the sandwich was rather dry. I ended up just eating the bread with the oil and oregano which tasted a lot better than the sandwich entirely. The meat was a little too salty so i just threw it away. Lucky my hubby had the other half of the sandwich or all of it would have gone to waste.

I would definitely come back here for there local selection of beers but not so much the food. They were pretty busy too but my sisters ordered a crab cake sandwich that got cold from sitting near the register. When he said he would reheat it, he fingered the crab meat to test the warmth then put the half eaten patties back on the grill next to another customers sandwich. That is not practicing good hygiene no matter how hot the grille is. That one deserves a mister yuck sticker. I'm not blaming the owner because he practices great customer service but his employees who were sweating....Not so much.. Try to get here when it isn't busy!!"
"PA","Ordered takeout from here tonight.

We ordered the Montezuma's Revenge the Hot Pastrami Mama and a cup of the portobello mushroom soup.

Everything was delicious and fresh.

We will definitely be back!"
"PA","Maybe it's a slow day...but we are here plus one other person. The guy sitting next to us had to ask for his sandwich to be microwaved...then when she brought it back he had no napkins and everyone was too busy on their cell phones in the kitchen for him to ask for a napkin. He literally had to reach in his pocket for a napkin. The cook did finally get us a beer...but waited on us with kitchen gloves on and handled our money. Not the amazingly friendly service the sign describes."
"PA","After trekking through the Carnegie for a couple of hours, we were starved! Sandwiches were huge and cheap and made quickly. We picked this place specifically for the beer selection. The boys loved the options and were so happy we picked this place. 

Parking is either on street (good luck with that) or just a few blocks down there is a pay lot. Not super expensive either."
"PA","I've made a handful of visits to Pittsburgh over the last couple months and I make sure to always swing by this place at least once.  I've tried a different sandwich each time and all are superb. I really liked the Donnie Brasco.

What drew me to Carson Street deli was their beer selection, which is one of the best from the places visited on Carson street.  Make sure to check out their cooler along the side to find some goodies in there.  Mike, the owner, helped me out in a pinch regarding a limited beer and you can tell the guy loves craft brews and his customers.

The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the beer selection is awesome.  I will continue to pop into this place every chance I get. Go check them out!"
"PA","I go to this place pretty regularly - the owner is amazing - he knows his place and loves to share his knowledge about beer with you. Every visit the staff has been helpful and friendly. The food - well I cannot say enough good things about the sandwiches. I also like that they feature a lot of local breweries on draft and offer you a chance to sample something new every Wednesday - great idea. Keep up the good work."
"PA","I came for the sandwiches and stayed for the beer! 

It's great the renovations that have gone into this little deli. Over the last year they've added a beautiful new bar and added to the patio out back. I don't know what more they could do other than buy the whole block! 

My go to is always the chicken salad sandwich. I love me a good chicken salad. Like the one with mayo. I say the one with mayo pointedly because I LOVE MAYO! And a lot of it. So if I order a chicken salad sandwich I want a good amount of mayo. I always try to duplicate them at home and it never has the flavor that this does. Plus, I love the Breadworks bread! i could eat a whole loaf and be one happy camper.

I also think they have a nice selection of sides as well. I usually go for the tomato and cucumber salad, but I'll switch it up with coleslaw or potato salad once in a while. I try not to go too mayo heavy on the sides since I get my fill in the sammie! But there's a good amount to try from including pasta salads or you can grab some chips. 

I think it's so cool the owner Mike's dedication to local brews. All of his taps are 100% local. Local as in, around the Western part of PA (Erie included... holla!). We've got some good places to choose from, that's for sure! Plus, he does samplings on Wednesdays and hosts regular nights were the reps come in and talk up their brews. 

If you can't stay you can also browse the 300+ bottles of beer they sell to take home. So you've got lots of different options. All of which hopefully end up with beer involved! So basically, if you're a craft brew aficionado, you must stop in here! Oh, and if you like sandwiches too!"
"PA","I love the new setup of Carson Street Deli.  New bar seating.  More table seating.  Excellent selection of craft beers.   Excellent menu and sandwiches.  The Reuben that I had today was very good but Szmidt's Old World Deli in Greenfield is better if you are judging on the sandwich alone."
"PA","I have had a few of their sammys, but the reuben is something else.  The marbled rye is fresh and soft, the slaw is unlike any I have had before, and the corned beef is ample and delicious.  

The beer selections is also legit (shoot I think I am missing one of their beer tastings as I write this) and worth popping in for a carryout or a drink in.  

The staff is cool and the sandwhiches come out fast. 

Just go."
"PA","Go to subway instead. This place is overrpriced and not very good. I would say the 5 best sandwich shops in south side are

1. real mccoys
2. fatheads
3. primantis
4. south side steaks
5. subway"
"PA","Beer selection was fantastic! Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. It's a great place."
"PA","I got the Sicilian sandwich, it tasted alright. I wasn't jumping up and down at the cost, subway is still cheaper. Food was made fast, the outside seating was cute."
"PA","I love a good sandwich. I had been looking for a quick sandwich shop in Pittsburgh for awhile. My boyfriend had gone for lunch before and suggested it. He had wanted to go back for some time but kept forgetting what the name was. A Deli on Carson Street named Carson Street Deli can be a mind bender, I guess. 

Their sandwiches are good and all their stuff is really fresh. They also have a good selection of beer to have with your sammy so, that's a plus! 

The beers are in with soda and other drinks and when we brought our beers up to the counter to pay for them the cashier made sure to lean in really close to check our eye colors to make sure they matched our IDs. That was hilarious but it didn't make my Cool Breeze tuna sandwich taste any less! Definitely a great place for lunch."
"PA","I tried Carson Street Deli years ago, before they moved, but I can't remember how I felt about it -- so let's treat today's lunch like it was my first visit, eh?

I was greeted by extremely friendly employees when I walked in the door, though I was slightly confused about where to actually order; I'd expected a menu board, but they found a carryout menu for me to peruse. I'd pretty well decided I wanted corned beef, and somehow missed ordering a reuben because it's listed as a ""Carson Street Deli Reuben"" -- not where I expected it, alphabetically speaking. Just so you don't make my mistake.

I ended up with corned beef, cheddar, tomato, and brown mustard on Italian (look, I don't like rye, OK?), as well as potato salad and tomato and cucumber salad. With a bottled drink, my meal came to something like $14.

The bread is, I'm pretty sure, Breadworks; not too crusty but not too soft to stand up to a big sammich. The corned beef itself is sliced super thin and tastes good, though I think I prefer Smallman Street Deli's. The cheddar slice was decently thick, and the tomato was, you know, a tomato on a sandwich, slightly out of season. Overall I'd give the sandwich 3 stars, partly because I should've asked for less mustard and partly because I wish they had challah and finally because I ordered the wrong thing. All of this is really my fault, so take it with a grain of salt.

The potato salad: Not my favorite. The chunks of potato are just huge, and there were green and red peppers involved.  Nothing to write home about, but not bad, either.

Tomato and cucumber salad? Not bad. Quite vinegary, so know that going in.

My pickle, sadly, was sort of small (just a spear for a whole big sammich) and unremarkable. 

I understand the beer is one of the big draws here; unfortunately, in my present delicate condition, I am unable to partake. And that makes me truly sad.

So why four stars overall? Well, I'm 99% sure that if I order what I actually want next time, I'll fare better. I'll be sure to let Yelp know!"
"PA","I love a good Reuben sandwich...
I even love a mediocre Reuben.

But Carson Street Deli's Reuben was like a breath of fresh air in my stuffy Reuben attic. The bread was fresh and bursting with marble-y rye goodness. The corned beef was sliced perfectly and piping hot with gooey swiss cheese. Topped off with delicious slaw and dressing. I would bet my beer that the dressing and slaw are made in house. Carson Street Deli just rolls that way (I think).

Sammies are $7.75 and very much worth it. Grab a beer or six as well and nom it up."
"PA","I absolutely LOVE Carson Street Deli!!!! I convinced my coworkers to order delivery from them a few months ago and, despite it being a huge order and across the river in Oakland, everything arrived fresh and still hot! I've eaten in several times since then as well as gotten take out and delivery. I have to admit that I've only eaten the Veggie Roma, but that's because it is SO DELICIOUS that I can't bring myself to try anything else! However, between friends and coworkers, I've never gotten a complaint -- only rave reviews on the bread, fresh ingredients, and pickles!"
"PA","Sandwiches, beer, staff, courtyard.  That more or less sums it up but just put the adjective great in front of all that.  Ok, first their sandwiches are packed with flavor, made to order and well priced.  The beer selection was mind blowing and for single bottles in PA not overpriced.  They even have happy hour specials and apparently do free tastings once a week.  The staff is super friendly and I really wish I got to meet the owner because I heard he will talk your face off about beer.  They have a nice little courtyard out back where you can enjoy all these things with some friends!  Go now!!!"
"PA","Went in with a large party for lunch (9 people) during the week since we all synchronized our lunch hours so that we could catch up and enjoy a meal together.  I was very happy to see that we got put up in the loft overhang area so we could be loud (talking not being obnoxious of course) without disturbing the rest of the patrons.

I usually take my time looking at the menu in an effort to (1) pick a dish worthy of a Yelp review but also (2) challenge my palate and brain to keep it fresh.  Unfortunately taking my time was not going to work so I went with my olde standby--the closest thing I could get to a Turkey BLT type sandwich.  ...because bacon makes EVERYTHING better.

All in all we had a chicken strips meal, a couple steak hoagies, my turkey blt, a fish sandwich, and a couple salads.  All of the food came in about 20 minutes, which considering we probably overwhelmed the kitchen, that was pretty awesome timing.

All of the food tasted excellently, and it was warm or still piping hot when it got to us.  Aside from a bit of a delay in keeping out glasses full of water/pop, service was on-point and efficient.  But that's to be expected since we were a larger group and we were up by ourselves upstairs and our waitress had tables downstairs as well.

I can't wait to go back with a little more time to give their beer selection a shot and maybe order something different. :-)"
"PA","The bread is super fresh and delicious. My husband had the Ruben and I can't tell you how delicious the bread was! I had my first taste of a Ruben, and must say, their twist on it with cole slaw is fantastic. Also, great selection of beer."
"PA","The Carson Street Deli might as well be my kitchen. I've eaten almost one meal a day here since I moved to south side in August.  The ingredients are fresh and everything on the menu tastes phenomenal and consistent. I usually rotate between the Reuben, Cuban, Donnie Brasco (buffalo chicken with egg salad - don't make assumptions before you've tried it), and their chicken salad. The portions are very healthy, and yes, every sandwich comes with a pickle. 

They have really good beer too. Plus, you can build your own 6-pack to try some of those interesting looking bottles without having to buy a whole 6 pack of it. If you have any beer-related questions, ask the older guy walking around stocking the shelves."
"PA","Carson Street Deli (CSD) is an outstanding low-key sandwich shop that sells delicious sandwiches and great beer, bottled and draft. It is a gem in Pittsburgh's Southside, tucked in-between many bars with likely much less healthy bar food. You can get the ""great beer"" experience at Carson Street Deli while having tasty healthy food, although less healthy sandwich and burger options also seem to exist at CSD.  

CSD has excellent sandwiches. I tried the unique ""veggie deluxe,"" which had hummus, baba ghanooj, roasted peppers, vegetables. It was very tasty and fresh. I also took to go the ""cool breeze"" albacore tuna sandwich, which was unique with orange pieces in it, yet almost equally tasty. I will definitely go back for the veggie deluxe, though, as it was one of the tastiest veggie sandwiches I have had in a long while (Side note: Subway definitely lowered the bar for comparison in vegetarian items).

CSD has an excellent selection of beers, much of it gathered from local breweries and Belgium.  The draft beer selection is small: there were four beers on draft while I was there, three from Pittsburgh's own East End Brewing Company, one from Belgium. I got East End's ""Monkey Boy"" hefeweizen, a must try if you like wheat beer. Many bottled beers rest in the fridges and are sprinkled around the deli, awaiting curious customers to try them and take them home. Even not-so-frequent beer drinkers like myself might feel compelled to try varieties of beer served in colorful bottles and arranged skillfully all over the deli. 

CSD holds free beer tastings every Wednesday evening. They also bring in unique varieties once in a while. When I went, quite a few festive holiday beers were on display. I did end up buying some unique Japanese rice beer, which looked quite delicious. They also have desserts and freshly baked cookies, which I unfortunately missed the day I went there as they were already sold out. Next time, I hope to try the rice pudding, though.

The deli is very clean. In fact, the cleanliness may make you forget that you are on East Carson street, having beer. They also have free wifi which let me set up my laptop and get some work done while enjoying my sandwich and beer.

The staff are very helpful, polite, and friendly. They will let you sample drafts and choose among the reasonably large selection of sandwiches they sell. It was very clear from the attitude of the sandwich masters working there that they care about what they do and serve. And, they do know and very much care about their beer.

Carson Street Deli can be summarized in four words: ""outstanding sandwiches, beer, staff."" No wonder it has been around and doing well since 1992. Go there if you are looking for an easy, casual place to enjoy reasonably healthy food along with some excellent beer. Go there even if you are not looking for that - you might be surprised."
"PA","I've had the Hot Pastrami Mama and The Balboa here. Both were really tasty and the cold cuts were stellar. There's a link to the menu so I won't go into any depth over the individual ingredients in the sandwiches, but the Balboa had an awesome oil dressing. The bread is some of the better that I've had in Pittsburgh (that probably means something different to everyone). There is a $1 fee for making the sandwich into a panini- I didn't opt for this, and I don't think I missed out. Each time I went I used a groupon so my perspective on the prices is a little skewed. I believe the sandwiches range from 6.50-8.00. That price range may be a bit steep for what is about an 8 inch sub, but it's much better quality than subway/quiznos. So if you're going for taste over quantity, I recommend. The staff is real cool, too."
"PA","Some of the freshest and best subs I've had. The beefy cheesy is rad."
"PA","My fiancee came home one day and announced he had the best reuben of his life at the Carson St. Deli. He told me it had coleslaw instead of sourkraut. I refused to believe it, but when the day came that I was able to try it for myself, I finally understood! It may not be traditional but it is completely delicious. I tried the macaroni salad and thought it was bland.

They have an awesome selection of microbrews and apparently you can bring growlers in to be filled. The owner, Mike, is so friendly. His love for his business and appreciation for his customers is obvious. He stopped by our table to make sure we were enjoying our meal. We got to talking and he told us that the type of corned beef they use was painstakingly chosen via blind tastings with customers. The source is secret but you can always visit Carson Street Deli if you have a craving!"
"PA","Carson Street Deli is a great South Side business. 

For over a year now, the owner has been running a Wednesday night beer tasting. This is the place to be to learn about every new brewery that gets distributed in Pittsburgh and learn to like a few new types of beer. Don't miss the annual stout float tasting! They also have a constantly rotating tap selection. At least one tap is always devoted to East End, and this is the place on the South Side to get East End growlers filled. If you don't have a growler, they have good prices on a great variety of choose-your-own six-packs. 

Aside from beer and Wednesday nights, Carson Street Deli has always-dependable sandwiches. Large but no grease, so it's one of the healthiest lunch options if you're on the South Side. If you get a sandwich with deli meats on Breadworks bread (i.e. the Godfather), you won't be disappointed.  

As an added bonus, this is one of the cleanest and well-lit ""bars"" on the South Side - a place you can go with your Mom or new significant other."
"PA","Ahh, Carson Street Deli, the crown jewel of Pittsburgh's Southside.

I work about two blocks away from The Deli (yes, it needs to be ""The Deli"") and rest assured, I order from here for lunch about once a week. That being said, it's the ONLY place I consistently order from. Their sandwiches are amazing, the beer selection even better. Mike, the owner, is knowledgeable and passionate about his brews as well as extremely personable and friendly. They have routine beer tastings on top of all that, though I've never had the pleasure of partaking in them. Sandwiches typically run about $7-10 and I've always been able to make them last for 2 meals (so really, I'm only spending $3.50 for lunch, right?!?!)

Pleasant and secluded patio out back - definitely worth checking out on a nice day.

Only downside is that I can't get one of their great craft brews on my lunch break. Darn!"
"PA","Some excellent sandwiches. The hot pastrami was sliced so thin that it was like butter. Not the biggest serving size, but one of the tastiest hot pastramis I ever had.

I also had the classic Italian. Very nice!

Only downside is their chili is kind of like Wendy's. Before purchasing, I asked the order taker how it was and he said that it is real chili with beans and not hot dog chili. That should have sounded the alarm, everyone knows real chili has no beans!"
"PA","This is a follow up review to my initial 5 star rating for Carson Street Deli.

I have been absolutely LOVING the beer tastings, the atmosphere, and the great (not to mention local) beer selection that Mike and the Carson Street Deli have been offering. Unfortunately one night about 2 months ago I was outrageously hungry when we showed up for that week's beer tasting and decided to go with a meal there. (I normally would just wait until I get home to eat to save some money.) I say unfortunately because the meal was sadly lack luster. 

I was really honestly surprised. I hadn't even eaten anything from there prior to this and I was admittedly holding some rather high expectations. I had the grilled chicken sandwich. The bread was ok, tasted about as fresh and homemade as I had expected, but I feel like the quality ended there.

I want to just put this out there, I've worked in food service with... low to mid-grade ingredients, I know the texture and the taste. The chicken tasted, looked, and felt just like frozen pre-packaged chicken slices. The condiments/marinade/vegetables were ok though. I also had a side of the mac salad and it had absolutely no taste. None at all. Not even bland.

I haven't been back to eat since then. I will give it another try since they keep getting such great reviews from other Yelpers, I just hope this time I don't get that frozen fast food feeling."
"PA","My whole Carson St experience started with a very grouchy and seemingly put-out woman on the other end of the phone. I placed a large carry out order and didn't expect to pick it up for another hour, giving them plenty of time to work their sandwich magic. She warned me of this in between sighs and I almost canceled my order because she was so rude.

So glad I didn't. I came in an hour later to get my order and the same lady apologized for taking so long. I told her I didn't mind the wait but did mind her phone manner. She was immediately, genuinely apologetic and was frantic with orders.  She didn't get an attitude but had real class in dealing with my frustration. 

Everyone in my group really enjoyed the grub (despite the expected gooey-ness that comes with carry out). I had the Carson St Reuben with turkey. It was divine... and huge! They don't toast the bread which I actually appreciated. The turkey, cheese and cole slaw were in perfect proportions against the thick slices of marble bread. Mmm, my belly is growling just thinking about it. I can't wait to go back."
"PA","Amazingly awesome pasta salads and sammies. Oh! and the grape leaves taste like Demeter made them herself...divine! There is so much to choose from and everything I've tasted so far has been really tasty. However, a friend had the macaroni salad and she wasn't so thrilled, said it was extremely bland and had to add some flavor (good thing I don't care for macaroni salad!) 

Fabulous beer selection! 

Fast and friendly service."
"PA","This review is more about the new owners and the atmosphere than the food. 

I happened to be walking by on Carson Street one Wednesday night, trying to dodge those ""THE WEEKEND STARTS ON WEDNESDAY, WOOOOOO!"" types. There was a sandwich board chalk sign on the sidewalk touting ""FREE BEER AND CHEESE!"" I'm not going to lie; there is little that will stop me from entering the building that is promising this. (Probably not the best thing to admit...) The facade of the building is beautiful and it's so well lit and inviting. Bright lights? Shiny things? Free cheese and beer? 

A friend and I didn't hesitate at all to stop in. The interior was just as inviting as the exterior. Well lit, clean, and very open. Mike, the owner (and who was running the pairing) was not only incredibly knowledgeable but personable to boot. I learned a lot about the four different beers they provided and exactly how they work with the cheeses. Everything you needed to know about pairing cheeses with beer was provided on a color printout. I not only got to enjoy some great beer and cheese with someone who actually knew what they were talking about, but I felt as if I had really learned something valuable. 

I've yet to go back to try any sandwiches but from what I've heard from other patrons they're just as amazing and satisfying. I'm very much looking forward to going back for another weekly tasting and maybe if I'm lucky an entire meal."
"PA","They have a new owner who has alot of knowledge about craft beers they now carry. Great envirorment and some of the best sandwiches in all PA. You can't beat the price with the quality."
"PA","4.5-  very good deli sandwiches, but nothing I would more than 10-15 minutes out of the way for, so short of a 5 for me.

I had the Jay sans dressing, very tasty, well executed. BF had the tuna and was quite happy. 

Yay! I'm a fan :)"
"PA","I really loved my Veggie deluxe. I've only been here once and I have dreams about it. I really wanna try the black bean burger. While visiting Pitt, it was very hard to come by veggie meals. I was so happy when my friend took me here. Great food! And next time I come to visit her I'll be eating here."
"PA","Sandwiches made with delicious fresh bread and loaded with lean meat keep me going back. However, at more than $10 for a sandwhich and side, I limit my visits. Also, considering you get your own drink and order/pick up food at the counter, the the big ol' tip jar in front of the cash register seems unwarranted?"
"PA","This is my favorite deli in Pittsburgh.  I swear by it-- fresh bread, good service, and a nice size pickle which is VERY important for a deli.  I like the veggie black bean burger.  I usually get two meals out of an order here."
"PA","The sandwiches here are so good that when you find one you love you don't want to order anything else.  But that would be a mistake because you would be missing out on so many other delicious sandwiches.  

To start off with check out the Godfather - Sopressata imported Genoa Salami on a baguette w/provolone, oil, oregano, red roasted peppers.

Or how about their Po-Boy which has two of the biggest and most tasty Crab Cakes I've ever had on a fresh french baguette.  Add a little Frank's hot sauce and you've got yourself a meal."
"PA","This place is insanely gorgeous! I just loved my time here as a guest of an event I attended recently. Every room seems to have a different feel to it. You could seriously have one heck of an event here with some creativity. 

There's even a full working kitchen... which probably comes in handy for caterers. 

If I was getting married (again:) or looking for a large event space I'd look here. You could really work some cool themes into the event. I'd love to do a Mad Men themed event here, it just seems to lend itself to that era. But I kinda think you could do anything with the venue. 

The only thing that would be an issue is that you would absolutely need to hire a valet service. We all know what a pain in the ace parking is in the South Side, double that with a super narrow street and you're pretty much parking miles away."
"PA","Very unique space for a wedding. The rehearsal dinner was also here, and the space for that worked well too.

Fun photobooth, there's a deck, dance floor, etc.

One warning, if you are taking a taxi here, they might get lost. Ours did, and we heard of at least one other taxi getting lost too!"
"PA","The space is as versatile as it is impressive.

I am having my rehearsal dinner, wedding AND reception at Jay's, so we're really using the whole place and couldn't be more pleased.

My fiance and I were looking for a New York loft-type venue that could hold around 180 people. In New York this venue would cost the same amount that my whole wedding will cost (we looked there first and hurried it back to the 'burgh).

We're planning our Pittsburgh wedding from San Francisco, so it's important that we have vendors who know what they're doing without meeting us often.

Jay has been great.  He's not so fantastic with email, so get him on the phone to schedule.  We're even just dropped by to look at the space and never had trouble being buzzed in.

Jay and his colleague Mike who works on videography  are always very honest recommending vendors who know the space and can work with us from a distance.

Totally worth the money for this space and the ease of working with Jay."
"PA","SouthSide tattoo is one of the more well known tattoo parlors in Pittsburgh with it's prime location on East Carson St.

I've relieved all 3 of my current tattoo's from Joe Capone. One of the artists there. Joe is a great guy and most importantly a great artist. While my tattoo's currently are not very difficult, Joe still did everyone of them perfectly.

The only downside to the shop is having to go through their store manager about your tattoo first, rather than the actual artist."
"PA","I walked into store a couple of time and did not feel like I was anything else but a number. When I approached employees it felt as if I was a bother to them for there time. I asked about getting a sleeve custom drawn and I was told to bring it what I would like done. There was no trying to talk to me or find out what I want or what ideas they had. It was ""Bring what you want done in, pay a $50 deposit and when do I want to get started"". I'm okay, I would not go to that shop, customer service is none and the art that I seen come from there is no where near up to par for the prices you pay."
"PA","I really don't know why these reviews aren't higher. I know a lot of people who have gotten great work done here, so when my roommate and I made a spontaneous decision to get another tattoo, this was the only place that came to mind. 

We didn't follow the usual protocol - make and appointment, get a drawing, make another appointment to get tattooed. I understand why they have this policy, but our tattoo wasn't too large or complicated, so we walked in. We were prepared to be there for awhile, which turned out to be about four hours (1 1/2 for the actual tattoo). 

Both of ours came out even better than we were expecting.  I can't remember the names of our tattoo artists, but they were very talented. It was a bit pricey, but to worth it. Obviously, if you're permanently marking your body you should be willing to spend some extra cash to ensure its an amazing tattoo. 

This is always my #1 recommendation for a tattoo place in Pittsburgh."
"PA","I was a Sunday walk in for a nose piercing.  I was greeted in what I thought to be a reasonable amount of time... I was given paperwork to fill out, and was waiting for the artist to become available.  I was provided with post care instructions that were very clear and concise.
Once I was with the 'piercer' he was very personable, and asked if I had any questions, marked my nose, and went for it. 
Although I have wanted a nose piercing for years, I hadn't done much research... blow your nose millions of times prior to going in.... be prepared for a betadine cotton swab to be shoved up and wiggled around your nose.  The piercing didn't hurt too badly, but threading of the ring wasn't too pleasant.
You are provided a bottle of betadine to clean your ring.
Over all, I am happy :-)

If you're looking for a tattoo, make an appointment, esp for a Sunday."
"PA","Joe did my tattoo, and I had a great experience. It's fairly large and spans the side of my rib cage. He was extremely patient with me in getting it placed exactly how I wanted, and did the whole thing, with shading, in under an hour and a half and it still looks fantastic three years later. I would definitely go to him again!
However, I wouldn't go back for a piercing. I had my tragus done, and while it was pierced well enough, their policy is only to use CBRs, which move a lot and never healed in my ear."
"PA","FYI- This has nothing to do with the artists. I called a week before the day that my friend and I wanted to get tattooed. When I called I explained I wanted to set an appointment but was told the only way to do that was by stopping by with artwork and leaving a deposit. I said that we were from out of town and unable to just stop by. They told me that best way to do this would be walk in. Well that's what happened and they were unable to take us. I understand that things happen but I would have been more than happy to email my artwork and give a credit card deposit to hold the appointment but that was not offered. We called another shop and went down street."
"PA","I have a few tattoos and every one except the one I got here looks amazing. The one I got here looks awful. This shop is not clean and they butchered my skin. The artist who tattooed me used the same gloves the whole time (they're supposed to change them several times, especially when setting up the machine and cleaning your skin). The tattoo I receive blew out within a week (this is when the ink spreads  under the skin and it does not happen with a quality tattoo) I went back twice to have the tattoo fixed. It got infected after the third time. My tattoo is raised, uneven, and looks unfinished. I'm planning on having it retouched by a quality artist who won't screw it up as badly as they did. I don't mind paying the money for a quality piece but this place rips you off. Please, if you value your health and your skin, don't go here!!!"
"PA","Not worth it to get a tattoo here... Went in one day with a friend to see if I could get a very small tattoo done and scheduled an appointment for the same day. The guy at the desk told me there was a required deposit for appointments so I put down the money ($50 I believe) and came back later. The tattoo experience was fine and I enjoy my tattoo but I had forgotten about the money I had already put down and was charged a full $120 on top of it. Not only that, this guy at the desk swiped my card, said it was declined and suggested I take the money out of the ATM they have in the shop... Only to get home and find out the transaction actually did go through. Of course I went back and told them what happened but instead of refunding me they just blamed it on the bank and said that it was just pending. All in all I have a tattoo that is an inch tall and dropped $290 on it. Avoid the place and go somewhere else, anywhere else."
"PA","Southside Tattoo has some really talented artists that churn out some great work. I am sympathetic to how busy the receptionist is, but every time I am in there, he is always rude and never particularly helpful or prompt.

The other day, my friend was hoping to get a tattoo walk-in, and Randy, the receptionist, told her she would have to make an appointment. We exited the shop, and my boyfriend was calling other tattoo parlors. He accidentally called Southside Tattoo, and Randy said they weren't busy. What? I don't understand."
"PA","The vibe of this place seems very sketchy, and the fact at all of the work on the walls has prices seems a bit off. The staff are unfriendly and rude and do not greet you after you walk in for a good ten minutes or so. That being said, I do not know about tattoo work here. Piercings, however, are a different story.
Don't do it.
The woman who did them did not seem to know what she was doing, and did not even clamp the area before piercing, causing bleeding. And then she went on to make fun of my friend for this, for a good long time. Talk about unprofessional! She also refused to put in the type of jewelry requested, and only put in the type she first grabbed, even with an explanation about why this type of jewelry would be the worst for the piercing. 
I had heard good things about this place, but I see know that everyone was very mistaken. In the future, if I ever need another piercing or tattoo, be assured that I will not be going here. Or trusting the judgement of said friends."
"PA","I've never had any work done here but I've been with plenty of people who have and they are way overpriced and flashy. I never liked the vibe of the place. Walk to In the Blood or Jesters Court if you're in the s.s. but if you're willing to drive, head to human productions in bethal park...well, first make your appointment because it might be awhile...that's a good thing!"
"PA","South Side Tattoo is touristy. But that's not something they can be faulted for. They'll pierce/tattoo younger kids with parents present. The place is usually crazy packed unless you've scheduled an appointment. Not a place to show up out of the blue unless you have the patience of Mother Teresa.

That said, I got my first tattoo here, and it was my best tattoo experience to date. I got my family crest--which has considerable detail-- on my left hip in black and white. This is a BIG tattoo and I got it for $180. I consider this a huge deal. I've gotten tattoos half this size at other shops for $200.

Joe did my tattoo and it's gorgeous. They gray scale shading is perfect. After 5 years, it still looks great. Despite the intricacy of the Irish patterns and knots, he spaced everything far enough apart that when the ink spreads, as it does, that the skin would not appear gray where it should not.

The entire ordeal was awesome. I was comfortable the whole time, the place was clean, the staff was professional. I stand by this being  great place but repeat that you won't have a good experience unless you put some planning into the process."
"PA","No Way!!! Southside Tattoo has a terrible city-wide reputation and for a GOOD REASON. 

#1 - most of the artists are just so/so. 
#2 - they way over charge for work. 

Hell, one time - a friend of mine and myself walked in to get some small, cheap, quick work done. Seriously, a 20 minute tattoo that we already with us. We talked to the guy at the desk, who was rude and said ""Let me talk to an artist"" - the tattooist never came back out, we waited for 30 minutes, no one ever said another word to us, and we left. 

Back when I was really young and just started getting tattooed, I got my first 2 tattoos there - both scarred, were un-even, and had a TON of fallout. I ended up having to go elsewhere to get the one touched up because southside tattoo would not re-do the tattoo (poor professionalism for a tattoo artist) because of the high volume, 2 weeks later, the artist did not recognize me at all... and the other tattoo was so bad I had to get a full cover-up. 

There are so many other good shops in the city - don't waste your money going to a flash-tattoo mill."
"PA","This is another place I can't believe no one else has rated yet.  My cousin and I were due to get our tattoos touched up.  After 13 years or so, my tattoo had begun to fade.  The place I had it done at is long out of buisness and when I talked to my artist, he wasn't a bit surprised.  

Anyway, my tat is of my four-string bass guitar and it's vertical, to the right of my left shoulder blade.  It is a very intricate pattern, but it just needed re-inking in a few spots.  I have no plans of ever getting rid of it either because I am proud of it!  Yes tattoos do hurt, but my artist was professional and as gentle as good be with it.  It was a tad sore for a couple of days afterward, but not too bad.  And my tattoo looks so good again.  My cousin's does too!"
"PA","Horrible bar. Horrible crowd. If you're over the age of 22 avoid at all costs."
"PA","Fun bar for a younger crowd .. Not my cup of tea
I'm laid back lounge gal.. Lol"
"PA","Mario's is packed and loud. the food is decent. The only place to escape the chaos is the smoking side of the establishment. There are less people over there if you dont mind cigarette smoke. But get this, YOU CAN'T SMOKE CIGARS! What is up with that. Everyone can smoke nasty cigarettes but if you light up a cigar, the little man behind the bar will come out and tell you NO. That is ridiculous. Just another southside bar. Nothing special."
"PA","Mario's is always a go-to bar if you can't decide where to go among the dozens and dozens of other bars in Southside. This place was my Saturday Afternoon hang out for lunch, college football, and 1 dollar Blue Moon drafts. Food wise, typical bar food, I always get the cajun chicken sandwich and the french onion soup and it never disappoints. I give it 5 stars for being a great local bar with a great staff for happy hour or a couple drinks on a weeknight. Friday and Saturday nights are packed with people, which is normal, being a Southside staple, but it might not be for everyone. Especially if you're over 23 and tired of that scene. I can't count how much money I've spent on the Mario's jukebox(s). All and all, I love it."
"PA","Used to here often when I lived here. A PGH landmark. Ignore the haters. Enjoy it for what it is and you will like it."
"PA","I went here to watch a Steelers game.  That was a poor decision.  The food was fried to a crisp, tasted awful, and was overpriced.  To top it off, our service was slow - we were dying to get out of there and couldn't find a waitress.  The layout is awkward so it was impossible to get a good view of a TV.  We stayed long enough to finish our meals and pay, and then we left for The Bar - a place that can be proud to call itself a sports bar.  I won't be back to Mario's!"
"PA","We did not come for the food only drinks on a Saturday Afternoon.     We were warned this placed is flooded by college kids at night - which seemed interestnig and we were thinking about coming back for the comedic affect.    

We did get our comedy for the day at this place.   When the bartender ran a purse out of the establishment to give to another person (who she thought left it).   The funny thing was that it was not that person's purse.

Any way the beers were cold and tasty.  We did not eat there but others were.    they have a spin wheel which determines the shot you will need to drink.

I would go back but be warned - this place will get much younger as the night progresses.

Atmosphere - Traditional Pub during the day - good craft beer selection - easy going / fun

Cost - normal - about $5 per craft beer

Service - Great - Our server was great.

Enjoy"
"PA","Mario's is better on weeknights. It gets waaaaay too packed on the weekends. Monday nights they have live music. It usually sucks!"
"PA","Classic Southside stop
Flirt with attractive college
Drunks while being crushed.

(b)"
"PA","An hour at Marios is like being inside an episode of Real World/Road Rules Challenge.

There's people making out, fist fighting, throwing drinks, falling down etc. pretty much everywhere you look.

If I was still in college, and this was the only place that would accept my fake ID, I would definitely go back."
"PA","Been there many times with friends who live in south side...on of the better bars iv been too...just wish they would ban smoking in Penn..."
"PA","Yes I am a fan of Mario's! Last year I was quite the regular. I knew all the bartenders and would come for every Pens game or football game. One main reason I would frequent so often was because it was my hangout where everyone knows your name and I wanted to catch the Hockey players when they were out. OK I was a little star struck but it wears off!

This bar was voted best college bar and sports bar of 2010 so I think that says a lot. Last year I was in party mode and if you are into that scene here is where the meat market takes place. Jocks and those chasing jocks from neighboring colleges pretty much live here. It is a busy bar almost any night of the week so if you want to be immersed in a crowd and you have someone visiting from out of town bring them here instead of some dead dive bar.

I believe that Mario Lemieux owns this bar so it is decorated in player Jerseys and sports memorabilia. The space is big so you will always have a view of the game no matter where you are. TVs are all over. I prefer to sit at the bar but if you want to do that, get there a little earlier, very early if you are planning for playoffs. They have tots! I love tater tots and they've got em' yumm. They also have many more apps and bar food. I don't consider it to be fine dining it's comfort food that tastes good with beers. Goblet night, $2 beers during game time, trivia, random goof off night, tasty shooters(blue sweet tarts)...those are the things that make Mario's shine. I have to get my game face on because Mario's it's ON!"
"PA","Perhaps I hated Mario's because I am older than 22 or perhaps it is because I felt like a pin ball being shoved between dude after dude.  It also could have been the Philly in me not being able to relax in a bar that has large stained glass windows dedicated to Pittsburgh Sports (I felt like I was behind enemy lines).  

Either way, the cheap beer was not enough to woo me into liking Mario's.  The music was too random to be ironic.  I am not good at math, but I do know that the ratio here of dudes to girls = sausage fest.

We had one beer here and it took all my might to not throw some 'bows."
"PA","It's hard to rate bars because so few stand out from any others. This one wasn't bad, but the service (as is true for most crowded bars) was average. Certainly, I've seen worse. In fact once I got my cheap Miller Lite, a server kept coming upstairs where we were situated to see if we wanted more. The atmosphere was loud, but man where the hell were all the girls? It was like dude central. They had some TV's that were huge so that was a plus, but there wasn't dancing or anything, it was a bunch of people roaming around drinking at a decent price."
"PA","There are many good things about Mario's. It's awfully spacious which means you can easily get a seat at the bar or a booth when just going on a random night or during the day  The staff are very friendly and the food is surprisingly awesome. Between the tater tots (hello) , fried pickles and my all-time-favorite, the Golden Gate Turkey, you can't go wrong with your pick. 

Drinks are strong and beer selection is wide. Go there on Wednesday night for trivia. They also have a bunch of TVs if you're into sports 'n at. 

Only downfall is that it does get super packed on Fri & Sat nights, but who doesn't on Carson St."
"PA","Bringing me back to college days- Marios is the less dungeony cousin to the old Playwright in New Haven... Actually I feel that the entire Carson st. street is very similar to the crown st. area in New Haven. 

My first time in Pittsburgh led me to conclude the following-
A. Big Big folks
B. Friendly folks smoking cigarettes
C. Jag-off is a word equal to the NYC Guidish term ""haahd-On""
D. These people love bridges almost as much a cigarettes
E. People can recognize Johnny Rod from W.A.S.P.
F. Dont order a Vodka tonic and expect to talk to chicks
G. Deconstructivsm at its best! -describing the urban renewal of the past 50 years and well as the internal organs of the heavy drinkers and smokers."
"PA","Each Wednesday, Mario's South Side Saloon plays host to Team Trivia. Last week, we went for the first time and had a blast. We didn't win, but if we did, our pre-trivia meal would have been covered, since the first place receives Mario's Gift Certificates. 

Before trivia, I feasted on one of the burgers, the Cow Tipper. The cow tipper is a hamburger with avacado, red and banana peppers, cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. Despite not being asked how I wanted my burger cooked, it turned out medium-well. The burger was thick and difficult to get your mouth around, but each bite got a little of every ingredient for a consistant meal. I wish the avacado would have been on top of the burger instead of under it, because it left the bottom bun soft and mushy. The curly fries were a good choice for a side, especially seeing the sweet potato fries were soft and greesy (how, I don't know). In the end, I was pleased and learned that I need to see more movies in order to compete in Team Trivia."
"PA","My girlfriend and I are visiting Pittsburgh and we went to Fat Heads for dinner (see my Fat Heads Review if you haven't been there).  Afterwards, we were looking for a bar where we could watch the Pitt-'Nova basketball game and then have a few beers.  We came into Mario's becuase both of us were full and didn't want to walk on a full stomach from Fat Heads.  When we walked in there weren't many people there so we were able to secure a good spot, which helped out later in the night.  There are two parts to this bar, im not sure what the other bar is called but it's a smoking bar while Mario's isn't.  I'm not a smoker so I really appreciated that it was a smoke-free zone.  We proped up on a ledge towards the back of the bar in direct sight of the bartender so he came over very frequently to check on us.  One of the owners was standing next to us and we were chatting with him for an hour or so and he's running a great establishment.  

There is a good amount of TV's positioned behind the bar so if you're going there to watch a game you won't be disappointed.  We didn't eat so I'm not sure if the food is good or not.  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I could definitely make Mario's my home bar."
"PA","I was in Pittsburgh for the day and I met up with an old friend who was going to take me to the South Side. We ended up at Marios.

Its a pretty cool looking place with a lot of room to hang out, drink and watch the game. The staff is friendly and they work hard and there are enough tv's to catch all the highlights.

They offer beer in numerous sizes which is a cool touch. The bar also has a decent array of brews for you to sample.

They off a large 64 ounce boot filled to the top with your favorite brew. I obviously had to try this and went with a very large serving of Yuengling!"
"PA","Rolled in during a trip to a Pirates game.  Great service & an absolute jumping crowd.  We were told after 11:00 the place gets jammed and like clockwork it did.  Great people watching spot.  Get upstairs if there is room and watch the Magen down below."
"PA","Mario's is a decent bar that doesn't charge a cover and has a TON of space.  This place fills with college students from wall to wall (and that says a lot since this takes up the space of two store fronts).  Reasonable drink specials (if you're down with domestics).  Not somewhere I would recommend if you're trying to talk with friends, but a great place to meet people.  Mario IS Pittsburgh's college bar."
"PA","Marios is a fun bar that doesn't charge a cover on the weekends, so it's a place my friends and I end up a lot. It's a pretty big bar, and it gets SUPER crowded, but it's a fun place where you can relax and have a good time.

I've eaten here two or three times, and the food is good, but nothing memorable.

They don't really have drink specials (other than a different $2.00 beer every night), but it's not expensive.

The one downer, though (for me), is that the Blue Lou's side still allows smoking. *cough cough cough cough*

Other than that, it's a bar that's all right by me."
"PA","Mario's is by far my favorite happy hour spot in South Side. You can't beat half price drinks and $3.95 appetizers, which is their happy hour special. I have never left there with a bill higher than $20 for 2 people... which for my boyfriend and I can include but not limited to miller lite ($1.75 each), hoegaarden ($2.50 each), double captain and coke ($5.00), large chicken nachos ($4.95), spinach dip with pita bread ($3.95... this by far is the best spinach dip I've ever had), as well as wings, mini hot dogs, pierogies, etc.... Such a great deal. 

Now I will admit that I rarely go to Mario's UNLESS it's happy hour, so my opinion I suppose is fairly biased considering happy hour crowds are generally more laid back and reserved and it's not as packed as I've seen it late night on weekends. But I must say, I love this place. I love the atmosphere, the staff, the food, the drinks... and as long as I work one block up, this is where you'll find me at least once a week from 5-7."
"PA","As many timed as I've been to Marios I don't think I've ever tasted the food. If you are in town and you like beer in large quantities stop by and drink a 'yard' otherwise this is just another Southside bar. If you are getting a yard you will have to put down a credit card for security deposit on the glass (be careful the glasses are expensive)!"
"PA","We got there and the place was packed.  You could not even walk in the door and the bouncers even stopped letting people in twice.  I saw two different people throwing up on a table and on the floor.  Our waitress took forever getting our drinks and was wasted and we are positive put a few drinks on our bill that we didn't order.  Drink specials are good though.  But it is definitely not somewhere I want to go on a regular basis."
"PA","parking in the southside isn't as difficult as i thought it was going to be.  check down the side streets and you're sure to find a spot within 10 minutes TOPS.  mario's is a great spot for some appetizers and drinks.  the happy hour on friday was a little loud and the bar music was competing with some dude singing and playing guitar in the other room.  here's the thing, the chicken nachos were $4 or $5 during happy hour and my cocktails were $2 a piece.  this is a steal!  you can't make chicken nachos at home for $5.  the nachos are served with sour cream and salsa and i was pleased that the waitress brought a little cup of each for both me and my man.  we love mario's especially at the happy hour price.  yummy nachos, strong drinks, chill atmosphere, cheap prices is our equivalent to a great night out.  i recommend eating in the bar area.  the tables in the other area (where the dude was singing) seem claustraphobic."
"PA","I love Mario's South Side Saloon! This is a must visit bar when I'm in town, and my childhood friends still in the Burgh frequent this place often. The food is incredible. The nights are fun, the drinks are large, and the proprietors cool. During football season you can see Steeler Jeff Reed film his show. Crowd is fresh, bartenders cute, waitresses hot (or so I am told)...come on...what's not to like? (They are under new ownership, and they've totally redone the place, too)

Spent my 26th birthday here...set up a balcony table, served my cake, got free shots from the owner to celebrate! Awesome guy!"
"PA","Tater Tots. Yes, this bar has tater tots on the menu. Need I say more? 

As a note, I avoid this and most uber-crowded South Side bars after midnight on a Friday or Saturday. You're either there to be drunk or to be seen - not to get good service.

However, if you head to Mario's for happy hour, you'll get a good crowd, good prices on their decent draft selection and some tasty apps. Their insanity wings rival any other bar in the neighborhood (ahem... fatheads) for their level of spiciness. Their nachos can make a dinner for 2. If you stay after happy hour, the prices are still pretty reasonable and the bartenders are still pretty nice. It's a great place to watch a Pens game or a college basketball game.

Overall, it's a good weeknight bar with classic hardwood everywhere, nice bathrooms, and TATER TOTS."
"PA","I visited Pittsburgh a few weeks ago for the Indianapolis vs. Steelers game...the game rocked.  This bar, did not.  I am a pretty easy to please girl.  Give me drinks, give me bar food, give me fun.  This bar barely accomplished the drink part!

There was a large group of heavy drinkers with me.  Most of us were drinking normal, easy drinks including vodka tonics and Miller Lite.  Our server greeted us but then was long and lost only reappearing every 20 minutes or so, took FOREVER to take our order and eventually pissed us off so bad, we tipped her $2.00 on an over $200 bill.  As close as we were sitting to the door, we could have escaped without paying and gotten away with it and my drunky friends really wanted to.  Having been a server in the past, I did my best to tally up the bill and we left just enough to cover before bolting out the door.

Not only did she not bring us drinks quickly, she didn't bring the right mixed drinks the majority of the time.  Even after REASSURING her we would be a good table, leave a hefty tip and be big spenders, she avoided us like the plague.  Was it busy ...YES, but DO YOUR JOB.  Avoid your small, stingy tables who aren't ordering food or drinks and wait on the ones with gusto who have promised you big rewards for adequate service...or don't and get left with a $2.00 slap in the face.

Our food took over an hour to come out....we ordered sliders, mozzerella balls and BLT sandwiches.  I'm not sure what the hold up was with the dinner portion but needless to say, with empty drinks, my little crowd of 10 was getting pissy.  It is too bad, too b/c the food didn't suck but one could not PAY me to return to this little hell hole on Carson Street.  There are way too many other fun options and the service ALONE killed this place for me.

Miss Waitress knows who she is...and even though her excuses of being very busy and having tables in all areas were supposed to make us feel sorry for her, after awhile all she sounded like was the teacher from Peanuts...wah wah wah wah, STFU and DO YOUR JOB...I hope your boss reads this and does something about it, b/c I'm fairly sure that it is just a lack of interest in your work that made our experience SUCK so bad.  Never. Again."
"PA","My friend went there after midnight on the eve of her 21st birthday (21 at midnight) and they wouldn't let her in.  The bouncer was being rude, so I mentioned to one of my other friends that he was an asshole...and he must have heard me cause he lunged at me like he was going to take me out!  (Mind you I'm a non-threatening 5'2 female)  So before I even knew what was going on, my boyfriend intercepted the bouncer and they brawled it out on the sidewalk for a minute before the fight was broken up.  That bouncer is lucky he didn't lay a hand on me cause I would have kicked him in the nuts.  That bar sucks anyway, so I'm glad my friend didn't spend her first legal night there."
"PA","There's a reason no one's reviewed this yet, and that's because this is a horrible, horrible bar.  The patron are rude AND nondescript. There's always a fratboy 'we didn't know what else to do tonight but wanted to pick up girls' vibe and the bathroom lines are so so so long on weekends. And the wait to get drinks can be pretty freaking long too.

It gets one star only because they do have alcohol."
"PA","Gross place. Has gotten even worse in the last year or so."
"PA","Been here a couple times... One of my favorite bars on Carson st. It gets crowded on the weekends! Huge bar with plenty of levels. Food always looks and smells good but I am yet to try it. Good deals on drinks, not too expensive of a bar. Reasonable prices and attentive service make Marion's a great place to start the night on the town. 

I do not like how the floors get sticky and aren't regularly kept squeaky clean.

Waiters and bar tenders are pretty attentive and helpful, no complaints on service. 

Mario's is a solid 3.5 star bar. I rounded up here."
"PA","""This world needs a new plague"" - Dwight K. Schrutte


That's how I felt after my last trip to Mario's. Perhaps it was because I was the only sober person on Carson Street at 1 am on Halloween but I have never been angrier at a bar ever. To start the doorman was an ass. I can't blame him all that much because I would be pissed too with the amount of ""21"" year old asshats coming through the doors but at least TRY to maintain some professionalism. Same with the bartenders. Ok I get it you are busy. But you are going to make a grand tonight so suck it up cupcake. Also use you head. Don't spend so much time on the drunk sluts who order 10 drinks one at a time and don't tip. My biggest complaint however was the clientele. So many assholes that for the first time I honestly hoped a place would spontaneously combust with everyone inside just for the good of humanity. I wish I could say that this was unusual but this seems to be the same story song and dance every weekend at Mario's. 

You may ask why this review is getting a 2 star. I must grudgingly say that Mario's does have some redeeming qualities, just earlier in the day. The decor is almost ""Cheers""-like. Lots of wood and stained glass. The service, when the bar is about empty, has always been at least pleasant. The food is ok too. Nothing great; standard greasy bar food. 

All in all this place is a passable bar prior to about 10 pm. Otherwise avoid Mario's like it was giving out free Ebola injections with every admittance."
"PA","At one time Mario's was the place to go in the southside, when it was the only thing in the southside.  But now the food is below average and it's just for a place for drunk immature assholes. There are better places to go now."
"PA","I LOVE MARIO'S! I visit Pittsburgh at least once a year and I make sure to visit this spot every time! 

The staff are awesome and personable! Even when it's super busy, you can still get a drink in reasonable time! 

I like how there are levels that welcome smoking and other ones that do not. (I'm a non-smoker and appreciate this quality!) 

It gets rowdy there, but that's part of the South Side fun!"
"PA","Marios is your typical Southside bar.  It is usually packed later on in the evening on Friday and Saturday nights. I recommend going early to grab a seat at the bar or upstairs (they have a really neat upstairs part of the bar that overlooks the downstairs).  The bartenders are friendly and quick to get you a drink.  They usually have great drink specials. Saturdays are $3 Blue Moon drafts although they did run out early on in the evening. The drinks are pretty reasonable priced (shots too) and they usually have a nice list of draft beer."
"PA","So, Mario's is your average southside bar. Maybe a little more sports barish than others, but nothing special. Drinks are cheap if you get the specials, and the food isn't bad. 

Overall, not bad."
"PA","Mario's, why you gotta be SO loud? Obviously bars will be loud. I'm 23 -- I can deal with above-average noise levels, but this is just ridiculous. The first time I came here two-ish years ago, at least I could appreciate the music that was being played, but when I was here this past weekend all I would think was WTF? There's a jukebox and I've got to assume that's the problem because the music that was playing was extremely random and extremely bad.

The things that really redeem this place for me are a) the food and b) the prices. I guess in Atlanta I'm used to ridiculously high prices for not a lot of food and paying $5+ for a semi-decent beer. When I saw they had a $2 Blue Moon draft special I was floored! I can't even get a bottled Bud Light for that price at most bars where I live. My favorite local bar at home has Blue Moon on special for $4 (it's typically $5), so $2 seems like a steal.

My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed our appetizer (cheese and bacon fries) and our sandwiches (I had the Italian Hoagie and my boyfriend had the Pgh Pastrami). We were so full from the fries that we both only ate half of our sandwiches. We took them to go, but accidentally left them at the place we were staying at while we were in Pittsburgh and we were pretty upset we didn't get to enjoy our leftovers. :(

Our server was really great and super friendly. It was crowded, but she checked on us frequently and made sure we got everything we needed.

I would definitely come back here next time I'm in Pittsburgh. Maybe not at night, though. All they need to do is turn down the music so I don't have to scream ""WHAT?"" every time one of my friends speaks and I'd give this place five stars!"
"PA","Great place! I came in to watch the Blackhawks game and Ray was a stellar bartender. Also had the pub fries, with bacon and cheese...yum!"
"PA","Decent food and good drink specials. We were in from Chicago during Stanley Cup finals and the staff was awesome in providing us a place to catch the game!"
"PA","My sister's friend's apartment is literally around the corner from this place somewhere on Carson street. To describe Carson street in a nutshell . . . . it is the Williamsburg of Pittsburgh. Maybe the more rowdy and care-free artsy form of Williamsburg with a few more grown-ups thrown in between. 

Anyway, the menu of craft and regular beers here was excellent. They even had Bell's Oberon! Which does not sell no matter how hard you try to search for it in New York. I know this, because the distributor hates New York and refuses to sell here. Oh, Michigan. I love you. Anyway, they had additional fancy things like Atwater stout, East End IPA, First Amendment, Framboise on tap, Leinenkugel, a couple Penn ales I'm unfamiliar with. But you know what? I had 3 pints of fancy beers. Guess how much it came out to? Only $10! I thought it was a mistake it was so cheap. They also had Blue Moon as a special of the day on tap for $2. I'm simply amazed. Anyway, the rest of our group also ordered a bunch of chicken wings which looked pretty good and came in a large variety of sauces and spices. The bar is pretty relaxed and divey. Both an upstairs and downstairs. Definitely a Pirates/Penguins fan bar. 

Don't forget to check out the bathroom. The doors are wide open and oddly the men's and women's you can easily peer into on when coming down the stairs. BUT they have chalk board walls in each stall! How exciting! See inserted pictures! And the sink is pretty innovative as well. It's like a shelf but the water just magically disappears in its rightful place!"
"PA","I love me some sushi, and the dragon roll (sans cream cheese) was great, but im pretty sure it wasnt supposed to be in a soy wrap as our other roll was (salmon & spicy tuna, something). We also ordered sashimi which was great but sushi guy with the green eyes, why do you look at me like I'm stupid when I say ""my miso soup is cold.""  It was super busy, so sitting at the sushi bar with the door constantly swinging open and the freezing air flowing in and out was pretty annoying, and the hip hop on someones ipod was kinda random, but overall it was just ok."
"PA","Cherry blossom sushi roll. Need I say anymore?! Well besides the edamame with Siracha and miso soup.. I just can't get enough sushi from the place. I have no complaints about the hibachi but I find myself at nakama strictly for my cherry blossom roll. Mmm. Sushi. Oh and sake bombs. God bless the sake bombs..."
"PA","Atmosphere is nice.  Made reservations right from the app and we went straight to our table.  We had a new waitress, but she wasn't bad.  We ordered and our sushi was out in probably 10 min!  Very fast for the amount we ordered.  The presentation and taste were both excellent.  All around a good sushi/hibachi"
"PA","Over rated, the sushi isn't as good as it used to be and it's pricey. I used to go a lot, the last few times I went, experienced some of the worse service I've ever had, and I'm in the industry, you gotta be REALLY shitty and mean for me to say that :("
"PA","Huge sushi rolls which were a little hard to pick up with chopsticks without them falling apart. Interesting combos of contemporary ingredients. We had the spider roll which came with huge pieces of crispy fried soft shell crab. Hamachi and jalapeno roll was good too. I can't remember the other two rolls we had but all the fish tasted fresh. 

We didn't order hibachi but it (the hibachi) looked kind of weak compared to other places I've been, not much of a show, no interaction between chef and guests, etc. Mostly just the chef tapping the spatula, no flipping, tossing, no onion volcano! Glad we just stuck with the sushi."
"PA","Hmm...rarely do I return and reduce my rating....never actually. But, this time, I have no choice. The sushi was still good (again, for the area and what we have available to us) and we tried some of our friend's hibachi and the steak was really good - hence the reason I'll still give three stars. This time, I ordered my beloved strawberry citrus-tini martini. While the drink itself was the same, the rim didn't have the same amazing blue sugar. And....there was some sort of hair or something of some sort in my drink...that I discovered AFTER drinking some of the drink. I'm still grossed out by it. Can I, will I return? I'm not so sure."
"PA","We were there for lunch today and it was ok.  We probably won't go there again though.  The food was average.  The cleanliness was below average.  We ate at the hibachi table and even though there were 8 seats at the table, the hostess sat my hubby and I right up next to the only other couple at the table.  I assumed she was planning on filling up the whole table but once that didn't happen, I felt rude to move.  No big deal really.  They brought out water, soup, and salad and I heard the guy at our table say there was a hair sticking out of his water glass.  The cooktop had plenty of small pieces of food from the people before us but I figured the chef would clean it better before he cooked.  Well, he did wipe the very center but the old food remained.  I really tried to not watch after that.  The food was average.  We didn't have chopsticks at our table which was disappointing.  I'm sure they had them somewhere and I didn't ask so that's my own fault.  I just expect them to be on the table at Japanese restaurants.  Lunch prices were good.  Ill probably stick to my favorites though...Pho Van in the Strip and Mekong in Dormont."
"PA","I've always had a negative view of this place considering I hold sushi places in high regards due to their emphasis of quality and spirituality in their food. Nakama somehow won best Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh of 2013, so I had to check this place after all. They took the characteristics of a club that I can't stand (lighting, dodgy host, bad cologne) and put it in a Japanese steak house. It's as much of a Japanese steak house as McDonalds is considered a burger joint. However, the food has yet to come.

Being that 90% of sushi is the rice...Nakama's rice had the right moisture and texture, but no seasoning at all, leaving whatever their sushi/roll at the mercy of the product itself. The crab maki is god awful and I have no idea why it's sold in any acclaimed sushi place to begin with, it was just so salty and pronounced in their CA roll (came with the platter). In their sashimi platter, 5 out of 8 of the were extremely tough, leaving the ligaments as the extra chew for me to deal with...I give this fault to the fish monger. 

 In short, if you're going on a date and you plan on getting laid through sushi using an overwhelming environment, contemporary sushi rolls that have nothing to do with Japanese culture, and using the cocktail selection to cover up the most likely undesirable after taste of the crab roll you ordered because of its sweet name...then yes, by all means take her/him to here."
"PA","Very busy at lunch.  Almost like they weren't ready for a Friday lunch.  Slow service, mediocre food.  I think I will skip this place the next time I am in town..."
"PA","Wife and I went on NYE. I got the blue crab and red dragon rolls. They were decent, but something was missing.  This is especially true with the blue crab roll. My wife got the shrimp hibachi and said it was equal to Little Tokyo and Benihanna. 

The service was okay, but they did put an extra chair on our table which made it a little cramped. 

It gets a 3 and not a 3.5 because the bathroom had an attendant.  Not only that, but he had pictures of scantily clad overweight women sitting above the urinal. Dafuq?"
"PA","Wonderful as always.  While very expensive, the food was delicious, the hibachi entertaining, and the ambiance appealing.  The sushi is some of the best I've ever had anywhere.  I would definitely eat here again!"
"PA","I love this place, i wouldn't call this real sushi, but its still really good!"
"PA","I like the food, I do think ther"
"PA","This place is awesome. Enough said. Food AWESOME service is pretty good too. Only recommendation is be careful of when you come. If you are trying to have a ""nice romantic"" dinner friday/saturday night probably isn't the best time. It is packed full and you can't even hear yourself think but other times is pretty reasonable."
"PA","Now lets start with I Love the Food here that gets Five Stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So lets get to the reason I did not give complete five stars. We (myself and about 5 other people) made reservations here for Valentines Day, our reservation was for 6 p.m. We did not get seated until 7:55 p.m. (we were all on time).  Then to make matters worse before we were finished with our food the waiter is bringing us boxes (rushing us out)."
"PA","Great for a birthday celebration. Great server and excellent cook! Had so much fun  and food was amazing. Had the veggie option and everything was cooked to perfection."
"PA","I don't get the attraction to this place. Maybe it's just because it's in the South Side and offers easy group dining.  My husband and I had a gift card and ate there saturday and we decided to sit at a small table in the bar area. Our spicy chicken appetizer was good  but nothing spectacular. Our meals were ok. Fried rice seemed bulk and not freshly made.  Their shrimp sauce was also not great.  Our drinks were really good and the service was really good. There are many other hibachi places I would choose over Nakama."
"PA","Don't go here if you are gluten free. Our server was pretty clueless and they couldn't prepare gf sushi. My food was cooked in the back, came out cold and I had half of what everyone else had. Had a reaction to my food. Def got glutened.

Also had to ask several times for water. My friend got the complete wrong sushi order. 

Not a great time at all."
"PA","Excellent food, excellent service. The Signature long rolls were delicious and the Nigiri cut was thick and satisfying.

The service was prompt and accurate, despite some complicated orders. 

Highly recommended"
"PA","Went for lunch with my friend. We sat at the Hibachi table and had the best time. We come here regularly but today was exceptionally awesome because of our chef's upbeat personality and witty jokes the whole time. Our chef, Luke, was entertaining as well as cooked everything perfectly. Would request his table again in the future. Also ordered a Philly roll, which are always delicious here. The veggie egg roll we got was actually pretty disgusting. It was so oily and tasted bitter. I told the waitress and she gladly removed from my bill. Other than that, lunch was great."
"PA","This is your typical hibachi place.

The Spider roll was a lot of imitation crab meat, but it was very nicely rolled and presented well. It was a slightly crunchy soft shell crab.

We shared a triple combo and the chef was confused? / annoyed? that we were sharing...but we were glad we did in the end...between the two of us, we STILL had food left over.

Started us each out with a bowl of miso soup, and it had fried onions and mushrooms in it, which was different, and appreciated.

The salad was good with a yummy sauce and mixed greens, carrots and tomatoes. On the better side of the salads I've had like this.

Our combo had steak, shrimp, and chicken...and it was just... a TON of rice and a tonnn of veggies. It was delicious, but as usual it was on the saltier side. That is hibachi for you, though. Pretty good.

Our server didn't really put on a show. Not sure if he knew English that well. He did all the demos, but didn't interact with us too much as I've been used to in the past."
"PA","I recently went to Nakama for the first time for a first date - many firsts that night. Starting with the bad: We made dinner reservation for 7:15 and were a few minutes late. We were told that we lost our spot and had the choices to either wait a half hour to 45 minutes, sit at the sushi bar, or just order food at a table without the hibachi experience. We opted to get a drink at the bar  and wait it out. This was a Wednesday evening and the place was packed. No seats available at first so we checked out the drink menu and finally we got a couple of chairs. 

The drinks were decent - I'm a lightweight so they were good for me. It worked out that we waited for the hibachi because we were able to be squeezed in within ten minutes. 

 I got Hibachi Seasame Chicken and my date got Nakama Tuna Steak. He also ordered sushi but our waiter had forgotten to bring it- It was really no problem because the portion sizes are pretty big and we probably couldn't have ate the sushi anyways. 

I have no complaints about my chicken - It definitely exceeded my expectations based on the other reviews I have seen for it. My date goes there on the regular and so his Tuna Steak obviously has his coming back for more. The Onion Soup was by far one of the better Japanese soups I have had. It has a kick to it that I haven't tasted anywhere else. 

Our hibachi chef was wonderful. He was entertaining, easy to talk to and was really good at his job. He even let us all try a little fried rice. 

I always have had reservations about Nakama because I thought it was an overexposed restaurant that jacked its prices up because of its trendy reputation. I really enjoyed my time there. It was clean and had a lot of energy. I'll be back again."
"PA","Some of the best sushi I've ever had....and I come from the East Coast.  Unreal toro, have some of it's available."
"PA","The 3 stars is strictly for the Laura the bartender and the daytime atmosphere, not the food.

I've been to Nakama a handful of times, though only once was it specifically for food. The rest of the time it was for a few drinks or some sake because it was a nice day out and I like sitting near their windows. I've never ordered a specialty drink, only beer and sake. Tip: if you go and like sake, get the Crazy Milk and check out the bottle for a few lulz.

We've ordered food twice, I believe, one time being referenced above when it was a full meal and the order was just some sushi for tapas-style appetizers. Neither time has the food impressed me. In fact, it's probably the worst sushi I have ever had. My boyfriend ordered a spicy tuna roll and the tuna looked like baby food, as if someone had chewed it up and spit it back out - no lie. It was disgusting, but he powered through most of it as he was starving. They also managed to mess up fried rice, completely annihilating the veggies for some reason. The sushi rolls I've ordered have ranged from ""eh"" to ""gross.""

I can't give this place less than 3 stars, though, because every time I've gone I've had a really great time. I guess I would break down my review like this: Food - 1 star, Atmosphere - 4 stars, Service - 4 stars."
"PA","A wonderful sushi joint, which hosts the best appetizer ever (the tuna and avocado). 

If you're looking for a one of a kind sushi experience definitely visit."
"PA","The food here is soooooooo FUCKN GROSS NOW!!! Don't eat here... The chef SUCKX"
"PA","Nikki was our waitress.  She worked so hard all night, not only for us, but for everyone in our section. Did a wonderful job for us considering we needed a new drink every five minutes!  She consistently asks if everyone is happy, which makes the dinner so much easier to enjoy.  Our chef was wonderful and cooked everything to perfection, along with asking the specifics when it came to little things we enjoyed about the meal.

Our valet service was also very personable and they made sure to open the door both times for my girl.  Really appreciate that.  

I'll be coming here for years more."
"PA","Note: for sushi bar. Did not go for Hibachi (because I've had enough of Benihana and it seemed really pricey). Wait was also nonexistent for sushi at the bar. 

Another disclaimer: I'm used to California sushi restaurants & chains (Japanese friends would have MUCH higher standards) and I haven't had good sushi since I've moved out to DC.

Friend & I shared: Pittsburgh Penguins Roll (when in Pittsburgh...), Spicy Squid Salad, Salmon Ceviche (cannot find on online menu), and Philadelphia roll (because somehow my friend has NEVER had it?)

Everything was really good! I especially liked the spicy squid salad and the salmon ceviche- the latter had pretty thick pieces of salmon but was so nicely presented that I didn't really mind at all (the same cannot be said for everyone.) 

Overall: good, solid Japanese restaurant. Would go again."
"PA","Overpriced Low-Grade Sushi

The sushi at this place sucks and is extremely overpriced.  I have tried at least 10 different rolls on their menu through out the times that I have been there.  The sushi is poorly rolled and falls apart. The fish and ingredients that they use are not fresh. The service is OK.

The hibachi is also overpriced as well. The chefs are similar to what you will get any hibachi place.

Also, if you sit in the bar area be prepared to deal with a bunch of yinzer wanna be NYC trendies listening to techno bumping into you while you are trying to eat your food. 

The only reason this place stays in business is due to the trendy bar scene and the lack of sushi places in the Pittsburgh area.  However, I think if a restaurant/bar similar to nobu, sushi samba, or RA sushi opened up in Pittsburgh it would blow this place out of the water."
"PA","I like hibachi but I forgot how expensive the fancy stuff were. With that in mind and my budget, I decided to get an assortment of sushi rolls and a signature cocktail. The sushi and coconut shrimp were great, but the cocktail was just a tease. It honestly tasted like juice. Maybe the light up ice cube was placed to detract you from the lack of alcohol."
"PA","If you're into the whole hibachi thing and the whole doing copious amounts of sake bombs thing, Nakama can definitely be fun. But I feel like I'm kind of burned out on hibachi since you're basically paying out the ass for ""the experience."" I have been to a couple birthday parties here and had a good time, though.

As far as the sushi bar goes, this is one of the better sushi places in Pittsburgh. The fish is pretty fresh. But I feel like it's way overpriced if you just want to come here for sushi rather than hibachi. Nakama is in no way trying to be authentic--they have a large list of special rolls and most of them contain cream cheese or crabstick (two things I dislike, which limits my options here). My favorite thing I've had here is the salmon sashimi with avocado, cucumber, wasabi tobiko, and ponzu sauce, which I tried on a recent lunch visit.

Unfortunately, once night falls the atmosphere straight-up sucks. This is the hot spot for guidos to pregame before they head to Diesel or wherever else those people hang out. The drinks are what you would expect--boring, but fruity and easy to drink. Like I said, you can have an amazing time here if you bring your whole crew and are looking to get tipsy. But if you're not in the mood for a trashy night out, stay far away!"
"PA","Best in pittsburgh."
"PA","I love sushi. So much. I recently moved from Boston, eating awesome sushi once a week, to middle of nowhere PA...with no sushi. When we stayed in the city for a night, we were ready for any sushi we could find. We really enjoyed the sushi at Nakama. Was it because we were so deprived? Maybe. Have I had better? Yes. Did I try the hibachi? No. So take from this review what you will. I don't know what it says for the food, but the most memorable part of my experience here was the martini. The waitress suggested the strawberry citrus-tini, so I tried it out. I don't like tart drinks, which this was. But the rim was coated, not just in sugar, but I swear it was the blue kool-aid mix from my childhood. I will return just for that drink."
"PA","Great place to eat!  Great Wine selection, had the 1997 Cake Bread Cabernet.  I would highly recommend this place if you want great food and great vibe."
"PA","Better than Bennihanna and Shogun. A little more expensive but less filler and more protein. The Filet & Shrimp combo was perfect. Our server Rae was prompt and very mindful. 4 1/2 stars"
"PA","Well... this place has lost it's luster for me. Everything that used to taste high quality and fresh tastes just okay now. The sushi isn't that great anymore. The habachi just isn't the same.

What happened? Did I change? Did this place change? I think it's a little of both. Maybe I can compare it to a relationship. Yes, that's it. Things were awesome at first. We were in love and everything was just perfect. The sushi was fantastic and fresh. The habachi was so delicious I wanted to lick my plate.

Then over time things started to deteriorate. The sushi didn't taste like my beloved Penn Ave Fish, my new amore. The habachi was missing something. Did the soup recipe change? Not as much flavor. Did the portions get smaller. Where did my sprouts go?! Things started to head south...

The last straw was the whole atmosphere or Club Nakama we'll call it. The music is pulsating techno. The crowd is judge-y. The service is lacking. And the food, it's nothing special. Sad, because what once was, is no more:(

It's time to break-up. We had a good run. We may run into each other once in a while and be friendly, but for now, it's time we take a break. Might be for good this time. You never know...."
"PA","I had the best experience at Nakama tonight. I am lactose intolerant and told the waitress, the amount of attention I got and the effort the staff went though to make my meal lactose free was amazing! The staff was so friendly, food was amazing and our waitress Jess was great! We also got to meet the owners an they are the nicest people. My friends and I come here once a month and always have a great experience! I recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys a friendly atmosphere and delicious food!"
"PA","So a group of us decided to go to Nakama for dinner and my birthday. I don't know about them but my experience was not that impressive. I'm probably going to go ahead and split this up into sections.

Hostess: Before we arrived we had called to see if they had availability for 6 guests. Luckily for us they did. When we arrived we ultimately ended up sitting at the bar and I went back to let the hostess know that we didn't need the table anymore. Most hostesses I know would be more than happy to move onto the next guests waiting for a table but this hostess made sure we were ok and double checked if we really wanted to give up our table. I appreciated the gesture.

Cocktail Server: Since we decided to eat in the bar we grabbed a high top table along the window. Unfortunately this table only fit 2 guests at a time while one guests stood. We decided to make due whilst we waited for 6 seats to open up at the bar. The cocktail server made her way over to the table and we ordered soups and salads and a few plates of sushi. Service wasn't too bad with her and I can honestly say she did a great job considering how busy she was.

Bartender (Asian Guy) Before we ordered food from our server we tried to get the attention of the bartender. His attitude was pretty shitty for the most part. He honestly acted like he didn't really give a shit. And for me I take notice of everything

Since happy hour had not ended we wanted to take advantage of the $5 martinis. I ordered a Mango Tango which tasted more like fruit punch and vodka. I was a less than impressed plus he charged me the full price of 9 or 10 bucks. Learn your happy hour deals dude! 

After the ""martini"" we decided to order a bottle of champagne from d check this I'm pretty sure we were the only ones in the entire establishment to order champagne.and honly had 1 champagne flute for a group of 6. One champagne flute and 5 water glasses. Are you for real? This is the epitome of ghetto. Working in the industry if you need 6 flutes you better pull 6 flutes out of your ass. 

Bartender (Mark) made nakama worth going back to for his company and that's it"
"PA","Food is not so good here .. But good for meeting up with friends 
Too have drinks and a lil sushi yum I love sushi lol.."
"PA","It's good. The rolls are better than the sashimi although one time we had some really nice(and surprising) maguro. We always get the hamachi jalapeño roll and some sashimi so don't get me wrong when I say the rolls are better than the sashimi. It's still enjoyable. Good atmosphere and my girl likes the martinis. Little Tokyo in Mt. Lebanon and Kiku in Station Square are better. Nakama is good for some enjoyable sushi and, more importantly, the atmosphere.  You can go here and watch the pens game AND eat a roll.  Can't say that about a lot of sushi restaurants.

4.5 of 10 relative to sushi quality alone"
"PA","Great sushi.  Excellent drinks.  The bartenders are great and very friendly.  

Sometimes it gets a bit crowded, but what great place doesn't?   

Valet parking guys smoked in my car however, so I knocked them a star."
"PA","Couldn't help but feel as though i was watching an episode of jersey shore as the bartender brought out sushi to her friends first, even though they ordered well after us. It was also brought out to only one part of our 3 person party at a time. We couldn't even eat together. It also took over ten minutes and two bartenders to make one glass of water....on a slow sunday afternoon, mind you Not a good sign.  Luckily the sushi is of good/great quality."
"PA","Good hibachi for Pitt.  Good tasty food, large portions and trendy environment.  I would recommended for group dinners, business travel dinners and Happy Hour.  Enjoy!"
"PA","Disclaimer: This is review is for the SUSHI BAR ONLY 

Went here last Saturday and stopped in for a quick bite at the sushi bar, mainly to try it out because I've heard so many good things about Nakama. 

To be honest, my experience was exactly like the two star Yelp rating means: Meh. I've experienced better.

Two of the 4 rolls I ordered were loosely made which as a sushi lover I found to be kinda unacceptable. One had an end piece that frankly would have gotten the sushi chef a failing grade by anyone's standards - it was falling apart and had nothing but rice and paper on it despite this being a fairly pricey signature roll. One of my sushi pieces was similarly falling apart - the rice hadn't been packed enough and the salmon was just slapped on there. 

I would even have sent those back if I could have found a waitress or been able to hear myself think. They were just too crowded to give the proper amount of love to each dish, and as you know, a dish prepared without love is bound to be lacking.

The noise and my seat in relation to the crowded door area just made me want to get out of there. I was bumped several times by people weaving their way past each other, at one point someone bumped my elbow as I was raising a cup of hot sake. Hmm ... a splash of hot sake? ... let's say it's not my favorite sensation in the crotch area.

Anyway, the staff was friendly when you were able to flag someone down and I am sure everyone was doing their best, but think this place is highly overrated - making it over crowded - making the whole experience that much less enjoyable for everyone.

Hope your experience is better than mine - the place should have been better from what I've been told by Nakama fans. Good luck!!"
"PA","GREAT  food  and really high prices  so it is good but i dont think it is worth it 
i felt like all you are paying for is their obviously high rent due to the ""trendy"" location

i'll go back but not often"
"PA","I've had pretty good sushi in the NY / NJ area and this would definitely be a place we'd go on the regular, so for the people of Pittsburgh PA, you guys deff have good sushi in town. Not only was the sushi good, but a great selection of beers, and a cool sports bar feel. Really hip, not something I expected in Pitt, very NYC like. 

My one comment would be on a Sunday during Football Season, nobody want's to see pirate baseball on tv, especially regular season baseball."
"PA","I used to frequent Nakama constantly, but the past few times I went the service was horrendous. The most recent time was the worst I have ever seen. A friend & I decided to sit at the bar & not only was the bartender rude, she acted as if we didn't exist! It took her 15 minutes to even look at us to take our order, then when it was finally ready we watched as she chatted with her friends rather than take it over to us. Nakama isn't THAT great, so when the service is bad.. Theres no point in going, I'll be going to Lil Tokyo next time I get a sushi/hibachi craving!"
"PA","Nakama is one of those places that pleases the masses. Go during happy hour, and you won't be able to hear the person next to you. The cocktail list is big and enticing, but the drinks aren't anything to write home about. Sushi is relatively good, albeit moderately overpriced. This is the type of place you go for the atmosphere, not the amazing food."
"PA","Went out with a group of friends, had a great time.....food was good, a little too salty for my taste but no real complaints. I will say, after having hibachi many times....the meat was NOT overlooked!!!! Had the Butcher's choice, strip and chicken were proper temps, tender and juicy....Miso soup was tasty, salad over dressed....my appetizer was the lettuce wraps, way too salty. Would go back but definately not a 1st choice in the 'burgh."
"PA","Been hearing about this place and love my sushi, so finally indulged myself.  It's a Friday evening about 6pm and the place is hopping with people and their energy (and noise level).  However, since I'm going solo tonight I have no problem finding a place at the sushi bar.  I'm tended to promptly and pleasantly by my server who helps me determine which tuna I would prefer for my sushi selection and lets me know it is very fresh tonight.  I end up with eel, salmon, and tuna plus a salad with ginger dressing and a glass of plum wine.  

My server checks on me, the sushi chef at the sushi bar serves me my sushi and it is a nice portion and tastes very fresh and just the right serving temperature.  I'm a happy camper as I do love my sushi.

The price is in line with any sushi restaurant.  I spent about $32.00 plus tip for 6 pieces of sushi, a salad, and a glass of wine.

They do have the hibachi tables and usual fare and fanfare that goes with it.

Plusses:  No TV in the sushi bar and no salt and pepper shakers alongside the soy sauces.  :-)  Been seeing that a lot lately so was glad it wasn't the case here.

The only down side is the volume level of noise which I would attribute to poor acoustics, perhaps?  Not a problem for me dining alone but if I was with someone and wanted to carry on a conversation, I think there would have been a lot of ""Huh?  What'd you say?;s"".  

I'd definitely come here again."
"PA","Much like Geisha House in LA, Nakama is all about the ""pizazz.""
I remember when this place used to be a RITE AID, and now it has a massive coy fish on the front of it. I'm not going to diss Nakama, because I actually really like Nakama. I've gone here on many different occasions: for family and friend gatherings, work-related lunches, or just for drinks. This was where I first learned how to properly use chopsticks. It definitely gets a lot of hype, and sometimes you can't even get a seat, but that's because the hibachi is so damn good. They have this creamy sauce that is out of this world, I know several people who order extra just to take home. The whole experience is nice, really. The sushi is better than average and the hibachi is great, too, but I usually go with anything ""surf n' surf"" (all seafood). The scallops are some of the best around, but a bit on the small side, if I remember correctly. Very good with the cream sauce I mentioned. Don't know what it is, but there's a reason why they keep it a secret. The service is a number one priority, at least from my experiences. 
Don't go for the hibachi if you're not in the mood to sit with other people, unless you have a large group. I took my folks once, and I don't think they were totally into it, but it's nice for younger people or a party."
"PA","Great sushi and hibachi. Very busy, reservation a must on weekends."
"PA","Not a fan of this place at all. I thought the food was O.K. and the service was horrible. We sat all the way in the corner behind the bar..it was so loud, service took forever, she didn't bring lemons with my water after I specifically asked for them, which I can't stand..why do they do that? What is so hard about bringing me a lemon with my water? They only offer white rice with their sushi which to me, kills the entire experience. The tofu in the miso soup was hard..we didn't even eat it. I thought this place was awful. Awful! On a side note, the salmon was $6 for 2 pieces of sushi. Really? Did the person running this restaurant think that there was a salmon shortage, that it was a rare species? Who do they think they are charging that much? Is it salmon laced with koala? BC THEN you could possibly charge $6 for it and that would make sense."
"PA","I love to eat here during the day, but never on crowded nights or weekends when you don't get any service. The stars are for the sushi chefs of course and their attention to their customers. The waiters still suck."
"PA","Had sushi and sashimi for lunch this week. Very generous portions and fresh. Have recently been to Tamari and Yamato and this was the best, with Tamari a close second.

Only issue was seating. We wanted a table for a meeting, but had to sit at the sushi bar because tables are limited."
"PA","I sat at the sushi bar, which has a great atmosphere.  The sushi rolls were tasty, and there was a fairly large selection. Overall, Nakama was good.  It's definitely one of the better sushi places in Pittsburgh, but it also definitely lacks the charm of a restaurant that I would call one of my favorites.

Nakama gets very crowded Thursday - Saturday nights, so get there early if you don't want to wait an hour or more for a seat."
"PA","The fascination with Nakama has always left me confused. I'm not a huge hibachi fan, so my gripes truly rest with the sushi. As far as sushi goes, Nakama simply doesn't deserve the praise that it gets. Granted, when they first opened, the food was decent, but even back then it was never a truly great sushi place.

Now, if you like your sushi over-saturated in sauces, then you might enjoy it, but all too often, the rolls are soggy, poorly rolled, and the fish quality isn't as good as you'd expect if you were judging the restaurant from the outside. Blame it on the pace with which the chefs have to prepare it...blame it on them hiring inexperienced sushi chefs. Whatever it is, it's just not up to par with some of the other sushi places in Pittsburgh. In fact, the sushi at the Tokyo Buffet on McKnight is just as good...AND THAT'S A BUFFET!

Regardless, it's always packed, and I'm a huge fan of seeing businesses succeed in town, but Nakama is truly a place that's gained too much from its trendy status. Unfortunately, I'm all about the food, so after you enjoy a good martini and enjoy the little hibachi show, what you're left with is the reality that the food is second priority to those other two parts.

The hibachi is fine, but it's nothing special...of course, when is hibachi ever truly a special experience, taste-wise? It's just a buttery fried rice fest in your mouth. The best hibachi I've ever had at Nakama was the ahi tuna...the cut of fish was actually fresher than sashimi that I've ordered there, and keeping it seared, but rare in the middle kept it from drying out. Or maybe that was just the butter...either way, it's by far the one thing that I've walked away with good feelings about.

The sashimi cuts that I've had have rarely satisfied. Fresh fish shouldn't taste so fishy, and for what you pay, they should be serving up better cuts. The sushi menu is interesting enough that you'll be able to find what you're looking for, but it's truly a hit-or-miss experience when the sushi hits your taste buds.

Overall, Nakama is the hot spot where you meet your friends before hitting the clubs and make random friends over some happy hour drinks, but if you're looking for a quality meal, I'd enjoy the drinks and move on to any number of better restaurants nearby."
"PA","If you are going to attempt to dine here on the weekend, make a reservation. I recommend Luke as your chef. He is very entertaining and his food is the best. I have never had a bad experience here with food or service. My girls, who are 9 and 8, are big fans of Nakama."
"PA","Have been here a few times when in town for work.  The place is a bit of meat market at times, but very entertaining.  It reminds me a lot of Ra Sushi.  I have only had the sushi and rolls, but the portions are enormous.  The quality is decent as well.  Drinks are okay, but I would skip any of the specialty cocktails.  Go with the sake bombs (sapporo and saki).  Late night is fun, as this is a place to be seen."
"PA","I'm really at a loss for what to say. Nakama has long been one of my favorite restaurants. This has been a favorite destination for birthdays and other special occasions. I went here for lunch on my wedding day! So when I moved recently, it's been a quest to get back there again. And then today happened...
     I went today, expecting a pleasant and entertaining experience. Unfortunately, I didn't get what I was expecting. I went there, expecting the full knife-tossing, food-flaming experience. Instead, I got a cook who cooked out food with his head down, barely daring to even speak with us. Half of the table's food was finished cooking before he even started the other half, leaving my friends to make the decision to eat before us or wait till their food was cold. I kept waiting for him to set our meal aflame. It's my absolute favorite thing about hibachi restaurants. But it never happened. He finished cooking in silence, cleaned the cooktop, and left.
     Now, I don't want to be entirely negative. The food WAS as delicious as I expected. Out waitress was very friendly and attentive. When one friend ordered the Nakama Panda (drink) and they were out of panda mugs, she provided us with a Lucky Cat mug instead.
     This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth, but I sincerely hope and expect it to be better next time I go back. And I will. One less-than-expected trip will not spoil this fantastic restaurant for me!"
"PA","Love this place - good food decent price! Great times!"
"PA","Went on a Monday at 8PM and the restaurant and Hibachi wasn't very crowded.  Monday also gives you $7 off the steak/chicken/shrimp dinner; which is a good deal.  I decided to try the restaurant again and my opinion stayed the same.  Onion soup is watery and not very good.  The salad dressing is not as good as other similar places.  The show is nothing special.  

If you go to their website you can get a free appetizer coupon but you can't use with the daily special.  No valet on Mondays but many meters are on Carson St."
"PA","5 people. No booze. $200. Was the food remarkable? No. Was it acceptable? Yes. Was it difficult to see in the low-light ambiance? Yes. Are there alternatives? Certainly. Do I think this place is a bit over rated? Sorta, kinda, yes."
"PA","Sushi is inconsistent. I've had bad sushi here several times. Habachi is very good, but on the pricier side"
"PA","This is literally the only place where I will eat shrimp. It's always fresh. Their hibachi is the best in town, no question. I think it's the sauces that really put them over the edge!

The service has always been friendly and accommodating. Atmosphere is cozy and fun. Even when your chef isn't there yet, you can watch all the other tables.

Oh, and if you look up, you'll see the dozens of playing cards stuck to the ceiling from a local magician's tricks. :)"
"PA","Great atmosphere and good bar/wine selection.  Sushi was great. Very yuppie and young professionals crowd.  My only complaint comes from the service.  We were seated at a hibachi table and then told unless the majority of us were getting hibachi we would have to sit at the sushi bar. I wouldn't have had a problem with this but the place was not that crowded and my party of 4 ended up spending a lot of money on sushi and drinks so its difficult for me to understand how they wouldn't accommodate us at a table.  Additionally, they forgot my appetizer and made no effort to apologize at the end of the night.

Great atmosphere, food and location. Improve your service."
"PA","Sushi is great and yummy. Service is really bad, horrible, terrible, poor, ghetto, inappropriate, rude, and all of the above. What's the point of getting reservations if you're waiting for two hours?? Oh and get this, we all ended up seating ourselves by the sushi bar because they took that long to seat us on a proper table. We ordered our own sushi with the sushi chefs WITHOUT a waiter, and went to the bar to get our drinks WITHOUT a waiter. About an hour into dinner, a waiter comes around with napkins, menus, and chopsticks...while we're eating our sushi. We decided, if it takes another hour for our bill to come, we're walking out. Low and behold, a waiter does come with our check hoping to get a tip. YEAH RIGHT. No doubt the sushi is good and the chefs can cook, but remember, its a self-serve kind-of-thing. Just sit at the sushi bar, tip the chef if they never come with your check and just bounce."
"PA","Crazy good dinner
Yum yum sauce on everything!!
Filet mignon love"
"PA","Literally my favorite Japanese place ever.  I love sushi, but my boyfriend isn't a huge fan, so I got the Boston roll and he got the steak tips. AMAZING.  We no longer live in the area, but we always visit it when we're in town."
"PA","I went there with people from work and it was a lot of fun.  We sat at one of the Hibachi's and ate some really good food.  

The sushi was also really good and I normally am not a sushi person.

I would recommend for a fun evening."
"PA","Great sushi, love going to this place for lunch."
"PA","So it was payday and I decided to treat myself to some overpriced cocktails and sushi.  My wallet was bleeding a little bit after this night but it was worth it because you can observe cougars (literally in animal prints) hunt their prey. Dinner and a show! 

 OOO and not to mention there was a magician! YES, a magician at Nakama.  Hilarious. As far as magicians go, I guess he was good! It still kills me that Nakama and Max & Ermas have the same entertainment. 

Service was a bit spotty. The place was packed but we still stay at the bar for 20 minutes sans cocktails. 

Pro: Busy, Lively, good cocktail list, fresh sushi, good place to start the night

Cons: Slow service, pricey, strange amount of bachelorette parties (they has sashes and crowns) 

Every once in awhile this place can be fun!"
"PA","We've been here a few times. I think it used to be more of a scene a few years ago, but I still think the food is good. It's the same hibachi show you'll get at any of the local places. I'm vegetarian, and some of the chefs really know how to be nice to a vegetarian (cook your food first, before there's meat on the grill), but not all of them. You'll get better service if you go when they're not busy."
"PA","My wife and I have been visited this establishment during the day, and on a Saturday night.  I am not expect on Japanese food, but I like what I had.  I am out of Atlanta, so the prices are great.  Nice place to start a Saturday night out, and nice for a business meal."
"PA","Aside from the Southside ambiance and the bar, there is nothing more here to see than an overtly OVER-priced,  UNDER-quality Japanese fair.  Sushi ""chef""s were laughable (being taught as they made my dishes... really? for a 30$ dish???), service was slow, having to remind the waitress over and over for even a glass of water... and the quality of the dishes mediocre.

Unless you are offering to spend at least double the amount worthy of the actual value of food and service, I would highly discourage anyone from visiting this establishment.

If you are looking for a classy, Japanese restaurant with a bar, I would go to UMI - SOBA on Ellesworth St. in Shadyside."
"PA","Anyone with a brain will instantly recognize that this place is not about the food AT ALL. It's about its function on the South Side; the Dream House for all the Ken and Barbie types. You will find Pittsburgh guido / yinzer OAFS eagerly paying through the hose for over-priced meat in hopes of wooing one of the many ex-sorority, Louis Vuitton bag hag bar WENCHES. For the poor OAFS who slobber over these WENCHES with their wallets, this watering hole is their surest spot to buy tuna. As for the WENCHES; it is the perfect place to parade the whitest teeth, highest heels, and blondest roots. This restaurant is the pole-dancing embodiment of what your average black and gold bleedin' yinzer believes to be upscale. Case in point, a hand-soap-offering attendant in the men's restroom; truly ridiculous........... just smacks of a naive pretentiousness that only the provincial mind-set of a South Side bar-barian would find 'classy'. I guess I'm not one for 'classy' restaurants anyway; they are always way too tacky."
"PA","Have been there several times. The sushi and appetizers are OK. The bar and restaurant is usually packed and noisy.  It is very popular.  I have had hibachi at a table (cooked in the kitchen) or on the big grill.  The show is not as good as Benihana's.  The food is decent. I have had shrimp, steak and chicken.  The vegetables and rice are OK.  I'm not a fan of the soup and the salad is OK.  I've had better but also much worse.   The service is usually pretty good.  They have valet but cheaper to park on the side streets or metered parking lot.  You need to make reservations or you better plan on waiting."
"PA","If you are looking for the twenty something see be seen crowd, this is where they mingle. My group considers this place a birthday celebratory location. Special occasion= a fire show...indeed! They have sushi and the quintessential hibachi grill chefs performing wild antics as they prepare your dinner. These guys know what they're doing and they are some of the best around. Shrimp slinging into my mouth...GOAL!

The specialty cocktails are ginormous with all the fixings, pineapple, cherries, and Hawaiian umbrellas galore. Nakama Panda anyone?  I get drunk just looking at them, yes they are too sweet and I feel like I have been transported to the magical world of the smurfs as I sip the comical bright blue drink! 

Picture a night out with your friends, eight to ten of you surrounding a steel table with a wooden ledge to perch at as you are served a Nakama salad with ginger dressing and greens. The dressings are always so tart. Next a small bowl of Nakama onion soup with mushrooms. I like the Hibachi shrimp fried rice with the sauces to dip my ""shkrimps.""  The food is common for this type of place so nothing exceptional. Entrees start at around $20. At least one person in the party has to get hibachi or no fireworks! As the meal is cooking blasts of fire warm your face as you munch and drink up the starters. At some point food will be thrown at your face! 

Finally the Pièce de résistance, happy birthday singers with your Birthday sunday complete with sprinklers and fan fare. (Note that you have to purchase this in advance or you just get a boring scoop of ice cream) enter giant gong...""GONG!!""  You're done! Out to the southside street you go to get LOUD and continue the party!"
"PA","I can't actually comment on the food.  The place looked nice relative to a lot of neighboring establishments and was recommended by our lunch-time server @ Nola (very good Creole) and our concierge.  My low rating comes from the fact that I called twice to make a reservation and no one answered.  After taking a cab from downtown we learned there was a private party and we wouldn't be able to take in the Jersey Shore fist pumping scene (thanks Callan W for the visual).  Simply disappointed in the lack of basic customer service.

We ended up down the street at the Pittsburgh Steak Company.  Not sushi but the gorgonzola filet melts in your mouth!!"
"PA","over rated, over priced and always crowded."
"PA","The food is reasonable but the place is great for an evening for some good dressing up with some good drinks.
The ambience is great but it can get a little too hot near the grills..."
"PA","One of the coolest meals I have ever had. Watching a hibachi chef cook my food in front of me was a real treat.
This place gets super crowded, so come early (or really late) and try making a reservation (although they will still probably make you wait).
We had to wait a long time before they took our order and a lot more time after that before they started cooking our stuff before us, but once that starts, it all really becomes worth it.
I am vegetarian so had miso soup, stir-fried mushrooms, vegetables and tofu with sticky rice (and sake!!).. it was all delicious... watching your food get made in front of you makes it soo much tastier.
Portions are enormous, so don't overorder.
Great place to catch up with friends and have a lot of fun."
"PA","A Saturday night out in Pittsburgh should start at Nakama for no reason other than entertainment (and good cocktails).  The place was packed, but we found a space by the bar in the corner.  We didn't get a chance to eat the food, but I can say the place looks kind of fun.  Not really date worthy as it was pretty loud, but the hibachi style dining is definitely a conversation starter.

I ordered a strawberry citrus-tini, a serious $10 cocktail.  In Philly, I wouldn't think twice about this price, but for the burgh, it seemed a bit steep.  It was quite tasty though and I couldn't really stop myself from licking the flavored sugar on the rim.  

Nakama is like the serengeti...it is hunt or be hunted.  Ladies brought their A game, or should I say DD game as most everyone in the place had their breasts on display.  We joked about a possible nipple slip...quite frankly, I wouldn't have been surprised.  The gents are just as preened as the ladies and I couldn't help but see that the Jersey Shore had made it all the way across PA.  Fist pumping anyone?

We only stayed for the one cocktail, but we were there long enough for some decent people watching.  I would suggest going for the beginning of your evening on Carson St.  I know I certainly learned a lot about the singles scene in my short time there."
"PA","May be a decent place to eat hibachi...BUT NOT sushi or sashimi!!!!  I have tried Nakama's 3 times to be fair.  Nakama can not live up to it's name as a ""Sushi Bar"".  Don't waste your time, money or taste buds...."
"PA","We had reservations for four people on a Saturday night at 8:00. We did not get seated until 9:00. In the bathroom I heard the hostess complaining about how backed up they were and that she wanted to tell the complaining guests ""I don't know you, I don't care"". This attitude aside, the rest of our service was really good. It was slow-going on getting drinks, but I could tell our server was really rushed. Hats off to the people at our ""grill"" who were going to the bar to buy drinks. It gets hectic at hibachi places, and they did a pretty good job for being as busy as they were. Our hibachi chef was awesome and adorable. He was really a lot of fun, and you could tell he knew what he was doing. 
The drinks were reasonably priced, as was the menu. I think it was about $45.00 for me by myself with a hibachi meal and two Kettle One cocktails. The shrimp was good, and the steak was really tender. The fried rice was definitely not the best hibachi-fried rice I have ever had, but it hit the spot. I really liked their miso soup, it didn't have tofu, which made me happy! 
I would love to go back and try the sushi, although I will probably avoid coming here during a peak hour, whether or not I have reservations. Definitely better than Benihana, although I have had better hibachi."
"PA","I love the food and love the feel. The only thing that left me a bit cold was the bartending staff. I have been there three times on business trips and each time they seemed to be indifferent at best, except when my bill came and I got a huge smile and a ""Have a wonderful night."" which was about as sincere as a campaign promise."
"PA","Was here on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. Luckily it was just the two of us so we were able to sit at the sushi bar right away and you get the whole menu at the sushi bar which was a good thing since hubby wanted steak hibachi. 
The onion soup came with our meal and was nice and spicy. We had the Hamachi, toro, sake, tamago, all nice and tasty and the nice sweet tamago. The caterpillar roll was very good and we also had the spicy yellow tail roll which was ok. 
Service was fast, really fast considering how busy they were. 
Prices are comparable to all other Japanese steakhouses, the steak hibachi was $28.00, the rolls were 10.99, 6.99, 5.99 
They have valet parking ($7) which was nice since we are from out of town and had no idea where to park. 
Talking with people there, they are always very busy and have 600 reservations on Saturdays, so if hitting it on a weekend or if you want to sit at the hibachi tables I would make a reservation. 
We both said we would come back. Only complaint I have is the sushi bar is near the door and I was cold. If you're at the hibachi tables I'm sure you'd be nice and warm ;) 
One question: What is with the cards on the ceiling?"
"PA","Found this place after the wait was too long at Fathead's down the street.
It was crowded so we were offered a seat at the sushi bar and handed menu's but then found room at the regular bar and those menu's were higher priced! Ridiculous.

It was crowded and loud, why the dance music at sushi place? 

The food was OK, the shrimp was a solid B, the strip steak was B+ but everything else was just average. The Japanese soup which is usually chicken based was mushroom based, yuck.  The small salad was trenched in too much dressing. The rice was decent, the sauce on the meals was just average. The check arrives with a higher price than the menu's. Turns out fried rice was $3.29 more than white, it would have been nice if the server told us ahead of time! Dinner and a Sapporo beer was $30 for one. Not a good value."
"PA","The food is good. I've  never had the sushi but Ive heard  it's very good. I only gave 3 stars bc the service is AWFUL   The manager is a pompous asshole,  Is annoyed at life And  doesn't care if you have a complaint. Acts like your disrupting his life if you have a concern. 
I've eaten here and had a few good experiences but I've also has really awful experiences as well and haven't been back"
"PA","Good fresh sushi. Get the appetizers if you can. We had the seared NY strip, which was delicious and $9.99 for quite a large portion of steak. The crab fritters were pretty good and crab-y if you are in the mood for something fried and not soaking in oil. We didn't do the hibachi, but the sushi was good. The toro jalapeno roll was pretty creative. The food is NOT overpriced for the whole package. Yes it is a bit ""uppity"" if you mean no one is really wearing their XXL Steelers shirt and the servers and patrons actually care what they look like. It is not a place to get a $5 roll."
"PA","This place has been a favorite of mine since it opened.  No need to go to Benihana's ever again!  It's locally owned right in the heart of the hip South Side area.  You'll definitely need a reservation for most nights of the week as it is ALWAYS busy.  You may pay for the ambiance but it's definitely worth it for the food.  For drinks try the Key Lime Pie Martini, for an app try the Hawaiian roll and for the habachi try the filet mignon or tuna steak.  They melt in your mouth!  Added bonus, if it's your birthday you bang on a large gong!"
"PA","I love this place.  I have been to Pittsburg for business several times and I always make sure one night for dinner I stop in.  I have never ate on the hibachi side, but I LOVE there sushi.  The crowd is always lively and upbeat.  You will crave this place every time you set foot in Pittsburg."
"PA","Pretty average sushi bar good food, great location. I'm a fan of this place."
"PA","This restaurant is AMAZING! My boyfriend and I  went there for dinner & were delighted  by the menu selection the ambiance at first but once our meal came, it was absolutely mind blowing. The sushi was so fresh, so delectible, so DELISH and I think this will be my new ""go-to"" spot in Pittsburgh for amazing sushi. There are so many more rolls that I would like to try. I cannot wait to return to Pittsburgh to go to Nakama again! :)"
"PA","I have eaten here many times and have found it enjoyable every time.  I must say I have only had the sushi, so I can't comment on the hibachi.  I am surprised on all the negative and mixed reviews on here.  I have eaten a lot of sushi, in a lot of restaurants, in a lot of cities and Nakama's is legit.  

The prices are very fair especially for the portions and how fresh it is...the nigiri slices and sashimi pieces are generous and so are all the rolls....nigiri (2 pieces) or sashimi (3 pieces) of white tuna, ahi tuna, yellow tail, eel for 5.99, salmon 4.99.....inside out rolls (8 pieces) 5.99-6.99...maki rolls (6 pieces) for 3.99-4.99....rainbow roll and specialty rolls around 11.99....this is hardly pricey considering how much you get, how fresh it is and where you're eating it at....I don't see how people had bad times here...did I just get lucky and show up on their good nights everytime?

The sushi is well presented and the service has always been good.  The location is perfect in the heart of the south side.  It's a sexy, busy atmosphere and can get loud, but it's not a big deal, sit by the window for great people watching up and down Carson St.  If you sit at the bar, you'll find it comfy and easy to eat even though it is a small place....this isn't the biggest restaurant but it's set up nicely no matter where you sit....The drinks are good too!  It's a great spot to take a date or with friends....It's the place to be feel and has a good, energetic vibe.  It's a fun, good-looking, classy crowd and I have to give it 5 stars.  Everytime I go to Nakama it's been a great sushi and dining experience all around...."
"PA","As far as the sushi goes, I'll have to pass from here on out. I can never understand why this place is so packed as it is when I pass it sometimes. Oh, I know why. Because people are clueless. Yes, that's it. (And it has a good location.)"
"PA","I'm definitely a Nakama fan!  Whenever I'm trying to think of a place to go for dinner for a special occasion or a night out, Nakama often comes to mind!
We usually get the hibachi dinner and it's always delicious and fun to watch!  We usually get some sushi too!  I live in LA now, so I've definitely had some good sushi out here, but I think the sushi at Nakama is just as good.  
My biggest complaint about this place is that it's way overpriced.  They charge you for all of these little extra things too, like fried rice, which I feel is pretty unnecessary.  The sushi is also overpriced in my opinion. 
Overall though, I've always had a great time at Nakama and I love the food!  I would definitely recommend it!"
"PA","I don't give many two star reviews, but this place deserves it. Lesson learned after dining here: trust Yelp reviews. Say it with me now, trust...Yelp...reviews....

Where to start? Let's start with the positives: Service was good, ambiance is great if you're looking for a fun (read: loud, energetic atmosphere), and the Miso soup.

Negatives: I paid $25 per person for overcooked, chewy steak and tasteless shrimp. I decided to fill up on Sapporo, salad, rice and veggies and find the first homeless person to give my leftovers to.

If you're looking for Hibachi in Pittsburgh there are other places that you should check out first. I can't comment on the sushi as we didn't order any."
"PA","This is another one of those typical Hibachi style Japanese places.   The food was okay.   The rice was cooked until it was crunchy; one of my pet peeves.

The place as also VERY LOUD.  You couldn't hear anyone else talk unless they were right next to you.

I don't think I will be back."
"PA","Not sure why the low reviews but this is one of my favorite Habachi places in Pittsburgh.  If everyone is mad about the wait for a seat, then reserve a table!!  The food is absolutely amazing, and the waiters are very nice as well.  This is a great place to grab dinner but don't forget lunch!  The food is quite pricey, a dinner plate at the grill can cost you a quick $25, and that's not including drinks and sushi.  Tab for two people including drinks is usually about $100, well worth it if you ask me.  Right after dinner you can find a great place to grab drinks in the South Side.  If you're complaining about the price, just don't go everyday!"
"PA","I personally never had the hibachi, I like to sit up at the bar. Its usually pretty hard to find a seat but if you are patient and come with only 1 other person, its usually doable. 

The rolls are actually very fresh, and very delicious. I eat a lot of sushi and I would definetly say this is fresh fish. I would also add that the rolls are very creative... i have never had a roll that I am not satisfied with.

There is also a great atmosphere as usually it is loud, lots of people, TV's everywhere for watching the game. They also have pretty good service! 

I definetly love coming to this place, if only it didn't take so long to find a seat!"
"PA","We visited for lunch the other day and we were quite satisfied. Our server was super friendly and prompt. My husband and I are what I like to call fake-sushi fans, so we got a California Roll and a Spicy California Roll cuz we were feeling craaaazy that day. We also ordered the coconut shrimp. Everything came out in a reasonable amount of time, although the shrimp came out a couple minutes AFTER our sushi, and I would have preferred it before.

The sushi was well prepared and very tasty. The rolls stuck together just right and had good flavors. The sauce on the spicy rolls had just the right amount of heat. I know, there's not much to a California roll, but what can I say? We're sushi wimps. The coconut shrimp was nearly on par with Red Lobster's coconut shrimp (which are the best coconut shrimp out there) but a teensy bit dry. This was remedied by the yummy, spicy sauce on the side (strangely reminiscent of the sweet chili sauce McDonald's had out during the Olympics...)

All in all the service was great and we enjoyed our food, so we'll be back. The lunch hibachi prices are very reasonable so we hope to try that next time."
"PA","Good place.  Almost always very busy... Might want to make a reservation.  The chefs don't seem to have a whole of personality.... And they are often times not Japanese at all... But the food is good nonetheless."
"PA","Finally made it here for sushi -  I've been putting it off  as I'm not a fan of sitting at the sushi bar  That said, the chefs didn't even make eye contact, so I was perfectly happy. Yeah, yeah, antisocial...  :)

They're docked a star from my perspective because there is no option to the bar/sushi bar area if you don't want hibachi and if someone is with you who doesn't like sushi, they are stuck eating off of the appetizer menu.

I always start with basic items when ordering sushi at a new restaurant - had salmon, tuna, shrimp and eel nigiri and a cucumber maki.  The fish was fresh, with decent texture, the cucumber was crispy, and overall Nakama might have taken over the number 2 sushi restaurant spot in my heart."
"PA","I find the sushi rolls to be quite good contrary to several reviewers here, though I usually put most of my efforts toward hibachi.  My favorite hibachi meal is the kobe beef.  It's pricey, but the taste is a significant experience for me because I love steak.  Note, I am getting rolls and not nigiri or sashimi (go to Umi for that!).  

I have been disappointed often times with the ""performance"" of the chef.  From an entertainment perspective, I've seen better, but the most important aspect is the food and I've always had it well prepared.  

The drinks are well mixed in my experience.  I even ordered the one with the glowing ice cube once, which was great, if only for the ice cube and ensuing ridicule.  They offer a limited wine selection, but there are 1 or 2 decent options by the glass.

The place is definitely packed all the time, which either makes for good people watching or is sure to annoy you -- it depends what kind of person you are.  I happen to enjoy the crowd.  The bathroom attendant is a bit much though.

Yeah, it's pricey, but you get a lot of food.  Most times everyone I'm with ends up taking some for the road."
"PA","Nakama is great......."
"PA","I really thought that Nakama was a great place. 

We went there for Valentines day. They had great specials and they also provided a complimentary rose with your reservation. It really seemed like they cared about the little details. 

The restaurant was very clean and decorated nicely. It has a large bar and sushi in the front. I really liked the open design and tall ceilings because it gave the feeling of having a lot of space. 

The wait staff was very friendly and very prompt with service and bringing drinks. 

I wouldn't say that it was any more busy/noicey then any other hibachi type restaurant. These always draw crowds and tend to be noisy. The pricing is also on par with any other restaurant of this type. 

If I had a complaint was it did take a little long for our cook to come out.  They did serve soup and salad quickly. 

I would go again and recommend it to friends."
"PA","The hibachis were already closed, but that is fine since I save my teppanyaki experiences for Benihana.  We sat at the drink bar and looked through the menu to find items that we might want.  It doesn't take me long to find what I want in an Asian restaurant:

Gyoza
Spider roll
Spicy tuna roll
Spicy chicken pieces
Hibachi fried rice
Marinated beef tips

Everything arrived in increments, which was great since it was so much food.  Our drinks were always full and the service was spectacular.  Where did Nakama go wrong?  All of the food tasted like a shadow of what it could have been. The flavors were not vibrant, which really was sad since I could tell that the ingredients were fresh.  My sushi didn't smell and it didn't have a fishy taste; it just had very little taste altogether.  

Nothing was spicy -- piquant -- that was supposed to be spicy.  The spicy chicken pieces are more sweet than anything else and the beef and rice was just as flavorless.  I wish that there was more flavor to everything that I ate; especially considering the price tag."
"PA","I really wish this place was great, but unfortunately, the decor does not make up for the mediocre sushi and the abhorrent clientele.  That place during happy hour reminds me of a Bosch painting, except for populated by yuppies instead of the naked damned.  The waitstaff is decent, but the hibachi chefs are kind of weak.  If you go on the weekend, you can have an awkward conversation about how loud you pee with the bathroom attendant.  I guess there's not a lot of small talk to be had.  I have had fun in this place, but I can have fun pretty much anywhere.  Oh, and if it is crowded, good luck hearing a word that anybody says."
"PA","Let me start with what works at Nakama: The servers. They're super nice and efficient.

What doesn't work is the food, the prices, the crowds, the incredibly busy, loud bar without the possibility of being seated in the quieter room (reserved only for Habachi eaters) -- even when you're paying $15.00/person FOR LUNCH!  And, the restaurant demands that you dress in nice casual wear. No t-shirts, yet the food was terrible!

We shared the Spider Roll and the Chicken and Shrimp Habachi plate, as well as a seaweed salad. The salad was okay. The Spider Roll came in a sticky, overly-sweet sauce which ruined the flavor. The crab was rubbery and seemed old. The chicken Habachi was waaaaaaay overcooked (dry to the point of being hard to swallow),  the shrimp smelled old , and it was NOT DEVEINED (read: it still had the poop tunnel in it!). ICK! This is supposed to be Pittsburgh's finest sushi restaurant? Old fish meets overcooked chicken, meets truly bad sushi, meets loud bar with no option to sit elsewhere (even when you're not drinking), meets overpriced lunch menu!

My advice: Go elsewhere! If you want something to eat, check out ANY other restaurant in the South Side. Even if it's bad, it won't be as expensive as Nakama. But, there are better places to be had in Pittsburgh. Not being from the area, I can't speak for sushi bars, but,  I especially like The Gypsy Cafe and Primanti's in the South Side. Cheers!"
"PA","DISCLAIMER: I've only ever tried the sushi. I have no clue about the hibatchi bar.

I was delighted to see that I'm not the only one who finds this place to be completely overrated and overpriced. The sushi was your average run of the mill raw fish. Nothing special about the freshness or the imaginitivity of the rolls. That is, except for the price. I couldn't believe that a meal for such average sushi cost as much as it did. 

If you're looking for some decent raw fish to feed your sushi craving, try Chaya in Squirrel Hill instead. You won't regret it."
"PA","This has got to be THE most overrated restaurant in Pittsburgh. I get that there's a giant Koi above the door and that there are always scantily clad women sipping martini's at the bar, but the place sucks. The sushi is mediocre and the service is bad. It seems like the wait staff would rather slit their wrists before help a paying customer. That's all I have to say. Nakama sucks."
"PA","Good food but you are paying for the atmosphere. Can't order sushi for take out past 5pm or somewhere around that time. Gets easily crowded and so loud you can't hear your friends talking. I go to the sushi place in the waterfront. Better prices and less crowded and free parking."
"PA","now i sympathize with a lot of the reviews for nakama, but in 3 separate experiences i've never had anything close to a 1 star time.  our most recent trip led us to the sushi bar where the service was lightning-fast and karma-friendly.  (our waitress forgot to charge a salmon roll and ended up comping it in the end)  

it may be overpriced, but isn't all sushI?  the red dragon roll was worth every cent as was the hanalei.  i've never ventured to the hibachi side of the road, and i just have a feeling that you'll be better off sticking to the sushi.  

cheer up pretentious sushites and remember that you're in pittsburgh, not osaka!

PS. nobody's mentioned that Nakama's cougar population is flourishing."
"PA","I'm a big fan of hibachi-style cooking, and my old place on the South Side was right down the street from Nakama, so I was excited to try it when I still lived there.  Once was enough, I'll never go back there again.

The food was pretty terrible through and through.  The meat didn't taste very fresh, the soup and salad were both forgettable, and the fried rice was AWFUL.  I can't understand why this place is so popular, my best guess is that some people consider it a ""classy"", ""cultured"" destination to get drunk at.  There are plenty of those types of places on the South Side already, and I'd venture a guess that even the bars serve better food."
"PA","Sushi was okay.  Nothing special, but a little better than Little Tokyo.  Bartender was rude.  Made my French Kiss martini incorrectly (I watched as he poured an imitation chambord liquor).  Hiachi was okay.  Soup was way too salty.  Salad was good.  The chix and steak were pretty good.  Service was horrible.  Had to pass all used dishes to the waitress across the grill.  Will not hurry back."
"PA","Quality of edible product: not good
Quality of service: not good
Environment: very loud in front room, dead fish in bowl behind sushi bar

I would never eat here again unless they were taken over by new ownership.  And then they would get one chance."
"PA","Nakama has OK sushi.   Nakama is noisy, the waiters take forever to serve you, and it's way overpriced. If you want authentic sushi go to CHAYA THE BEST SUSHI IN THE BURGH!"
"PA","Great location in Southside and good if you want to fulfill a Hibachi craving. However, not the greatest Hibachi, nor the most authentic either. It's also really loud in the restaurant."
"PA","This is a god-awful excuse for a restaurant.  The actual serving of food is last on its list of priorities, which run something like this:
1) Having heavily-made-up waitresses treat diners rudely.
2) Functioning as a place for bald-headed men to drink.
3) Using ""valet parking"" to totally tie up the intersection of 17th and Carson.
4) Being a mediocre-to-poor Americanized ""Japanese"" restaurant.

I had sushi the only time I came here (probably about three years ago).  It was really bad.  Cold, rubbery rice that not only didn't have any rice vinegar in it, but wasn't properly cooked.  Rolls looked like they had been created in a fit of pique by a drunken marmot or other mammal lacking opposable thumbs.  And the fish, while not being actively spoiled, was not notable for its freshness either.

If you want hibachi, try Yokoso.  If you want excellent, authentic sushi, try Chaya in Squirrel Hill.  If you want pretty decent, cheap sushi, try Oishii Bento in Oakland.  But for the love of god, don't come here for any reason."
"PA","This used to be our favorite sushi & sashimi bar in Pittsburgh but it seems the quality & service are travelling down hill, or at least they were last night.  We went here for my birthday and were greeted by the hostess with a blank stare.  She didn't say anything...  Nothing...  So I said, 'Hi, we'd like a teppanyaki table', to which she responded with another blank stare.  Then I said 'Hibachi...' and she woke up and said, 'That'll be at least 15-20 minutes or so...' and then went back to her blank stare.  Nothing like, 'Would you like to grab seats at the bar? Start your meal off with a drink? How about a sushi roll while you wait...' nothing...  So I said, 'Ok, we'll wait...' and seated ourselves at the sushi bar.  It took at least 5 minutes for the actual waitress to appear and it seemed like it was a chore for her to get us a couple glasses of water.  She didn't offer any help picking out rolls or sushi so we were on our own.  We settled on a 'Steeler Roll' for $14.  Looking around at the closest hibachi table to us, I could see 6 people seated and 2 empty seats.  I figured they were waiting for someone- turned out they weren't.  I also assumed that maybe they had ordered already- they hadn't.  Had they ordered drinks already maybe- Nope...  It was obvious that the hostess just wanted to be ignorant and make us wait for another table.  Ok, fine.  She doesn't get tipped anyway.  So our roll arrives and we start in on it.  It tastes pretty good but the eel that we so love is being lost in the quantity of rice surrounding it.  It even had trouble staying together.  Then the hostess comes over and says 'Are you ready...?' to which I look at her, then at the roll, and say, 'We'll need a few minutes...'

On to the teppanyaki table...

The restaurant was super loud because I think there was an 'End of the Season Pittsburgh Steeler party' in the back room and they were making all kinds of commotion so I can't fault the waiter on how hard it was for all of us to hear him.  Oh, by the way- our table was only half full when they started service.  There was my wife & I and another couple.  Maybe they were trying to get us in & out quickly, I don't know...  Our waiter started to take our orders and I heard him offer the couple next to us, 'Would you like to upgrade your white rice for fried for an additional charge?' and they both said no.  Looking in the menu, I see that a side of fried rice without any purchase is $3.29 so when it came time for us to order, he offered the same thing and I asked him how much the 'upcharge' was.  $3.29 was his response.  Why wouldn't he just ask if we'd like an additional side of fried rice for $3.29 instead of making it sound like you were getting a better deal by declining the white rice in favor of fried for $3.29???  Stuff like this really bothers me so I told him, 'I would like fried rice but I also want the steamed rice I'm already paying for...' to which he says, 'Fine with me man, I don't care how much rice I bring out...'  Nice customer service...  Anyway, we ended up with the only American teppanyaki chef in the entire place, and he was just getting over bronchitis or something because he barely spoke and when he did, it was in a very low tone.  Don't get me wrong- he was a very nice guy...  My wife had ordered the Bob's Triple Combo (Strip steak, Chicken & Shrimp) and I ordered the Chef's Choice (Strip steak & Chicken).  They were both delicious and aside from the service issues, we had a very nice meal.  

We both agreed though- next time we're going out for sushi- we're going to Sake at South Side Works.  The chefs are much friendlier, the fish is fresher and the prices are much more reasonable (Half price on Sunday's & Monday's)"
"PA","I like the Hibachi experience, and I don't eat seafood. That being said, it is a little overpriced for the quality of the food. I have gone a few times. I like that they give veteran's a meal for free on veteran's day."
"PA","This was truly a major disappointment.  The restaurant is way over-priced and the food is just ""average"".  There are so many of these types of restaurants around that I would not waste my time with this place.  I had a steak and shrimp dish that was average.  Shrimp was OK but the steak was tough and over cooked.  I ask for medium rare and got medium which was well done by the time everything else was cooked.  Service was marginal yet the restaurant was not full.  Very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone."
"PA","Yummy! Clean, lots of options, good beer selection,  nice music playing, great atmosphere, prices were a little high for sushi (about $2 more a roll than usual). Overall nice date night."
"PA","I've never had a bad experience here. The staff is great and so is the food. I usually go with the Yakitori (teriyaki chicken skewered) for a good lunch. Hibachi and sushi are great too."
"PA","When they first opened the food was great. We would go at least once a month. In the last year or two the quality has gone down. The portions have gone down and the $$ has gone up. Also the consistency in the food has dropped.  Used to be our favorite place, now it doesn't come up when we talk about going to eat."
"PA","Overly boisterous. Deaf staff. Fillers in the good so there's no flavor. Our hibachi chef was non-Japanese and kept saying how he just learned how to do everything. He basically wanted us to clap every time he cracked an egg. As he left he said,""gotta make more money""
Never going back to this place."
"PA","It's interesting that one of the most crowded restaurants in the South Side (possibly, all of Pittsburgh?) has such bad ratings on Yelp. I think Yelpers have it right in the case. Nakama totally did not live up to the hype for me. I had the hibachi and it was just mediocre. The chef / entertainer wasn't even that good - no cool tricks and he didn't even try throwing food in my mouth. The place was so loud that there is no way you can have a decent conversation if you come with a group of people. And, I swear they celebrated 10 birthdays during the hour we were dining there. They have this irritating gong that they bring out. You can't hear the guy next to you, but you will hear every birthday dinner that night. 

A bunch of my co-workers like Nakama's sushi bar, so when I get a chance to try it, I'll update my review. Until then, I'm not quickly planning my next Nakama outing."
"PA","For the life of me, I can't understand why people rave about this place.  Their sushi is lousy, and their hibachi is mediocre at best!  And waaaaay overpriced.

Granted the location is great and the decor is awesome, but I as a diner I'm much more concerned about food/service quality than a gorgeous setting.  Thumbs down, try Yokoso on the Waterfront."
"PA","I went to the hibachi with a few friends here on a weeknight, and I didn't try the sushi so I can't speak to it.  It was pretty packed and indeed, it was very loud and very dark.  You seriously might want to bring a flashlight to read the menu (I'm not joking).  There were only 4 of us at the hibachi table, so the  fun factor was pretty dulled down, but it didn't help that you couldn't really hear what the guy was trying to say anyway.  The server had a hard time hearing me as well, but my order of chicken was correct.  So as for the food:
Salad - was well saturated with ginger dressing -I mean they must have tossed it with a good amount of dressing before bringing it out.  The dressing was good, but definitely not that good. 
Soup - salted and fine, nothing notable.
Shrimp flambe - chewy, tasteless, didn't even have the butter flavor.
Rice - steamed and fine
Chicken and veggies - dry dry dry chicken, veggies were good, and the flavors on the veggies were very good.  
Sauces - okay
The ladies room:
Pretty clean, and also staffed.

Bottom line for me - I wouldn't come back here on my own volition - there are other places in Pgh I would try first."
"PA","I worked at a top notch sushi restaurant and was educated very well with the real definition of sushi over summer. and having come back to pittsburgh and eating at nakama, i was sadly disappointed. no one knows what they're serving and it's just a trendy place that pretends to serve sushi for people to say they ""eat sushi"". the drinks and bar section is fun and the tvs are great for games. but i would not go back there for any food any time soon."
"PA","I ate at Nakama for the first time last night, sat at the sushi bar with two friends, ordered a ton of food, and an expensive bottle of sake (which was over priced and soso in quality). Despite the money we dropped, the service was horrible, simply put; unprofessional, rude, and snotty.

Now, this place has nothing to be uppity about: THEY DO NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT SUSHI IS. It was Americanized to the extreme, the menu was embarrassing, as with the wine and sake list. The sashimi was so poorly cut you could barley chew on it, the maki was not tightly rolled. And the fish... oh the fish, no flavor.

The hipster crowd should of tipped me off, this is place for people who do not know anything about dining, and probably only eat sushi because they think it's the cool thing to do. The crowd was nothing but meat heads and trashy looking girls, the music selections we're bottom of the barrel, and the blaring sports tv's would ruin anyones dinner who cares."
"PA","I love sushi - and even though Nakama is always extremely busy and crowded, they have a great sushi menu.  I had the avocado and Philadelphia roll when I was last here, but one young chef was very sweet and gave my friend and me an entire roll for free.  You can't beat that!"
"PA","Review for Bar/Scene Only:

My mom says my crackface cousin (she doesn't call him that) raves about this place.  My random childhood friend's boss told me I should come here to meet interesting people.  

I went for drinky times.

I brought a City Paper with me, as I was alone and needed some entertainment.  I sat at the bar for about 20 minutes, watching everyone around me get served.  Two large, bald headed gentlemen sidled up and were taken care of immediately by the bartender.  Still nothing in front of me.  

Eventually I was asked ""Are you OK?"" at which point I requested a drink list.  Now, I don't really go in for too much mixed alcohol or sweet stuff, so I ended up just ordering a Pearl (cold-unfiltered) sake.

I'm not sure what people see in this place.  I mean, the bar scene is almost all large and/or old(er) people who usually happen to be bald if they possess a scrotum.  I mean, that's fine, that's cool.  Just not what I consider a ""happening scene"".  

Also, my bartender made me taste the sake before giving it to me.  I thinke maybe he thought I didn't know what I was ordering.  To be fair, I was the only one in the whole bar drinking sake, so maybe they don't sell that much of it.

The food may be tasty, but I was warned that it would ""give me the poops"".  Can't verify that though.  

Has anyone else noted the playing cards stuck to the ceiling?  That's pretty cool.  I also like the exposed pipes.  It's really not so bad from a design standpoint.  Just a Pittsburgh kind of place, I guess..."
"PA","I have to say, I was not super impressed by this place at all. I have been wanting to try Nakama since I moved to Pittsburgh in 2011, but I never got around to going. My overall impression is that this place is spectacularly average, and extremely overpriced. Dishes range from $30-$40 on average, unless you order the Kobe Steak dish, which is a whopping $70. Wow. I went on a Sunday night, so it was not crowded or loud as I'm sure it is on weekends, being in such a prime location on the south side. We were seated right away and our server was polite, friendly and fast. No problems there. 

We got a sushi appetizer that was delicious and fresh, but it was pretty expensive for the quantity. I have had good sushi for cheaper, and this became the theme of the night: ""it's good, but why is it so expensive?"" I did not find, as other reviewers have said, that this was the best sushi in the city. It was very good. It was high quality, but it was not the best, and it was expensive. 

I ordered the tuna steak hibachi, and my boyfriend ordered a spicy steak hibachi dish. Hibachi orders at this place include the typical salad and miso soup, as well as an appetizer of either mushrooms or shrimp. I will say that the miso soup was the best I have ever had a joint like this. It was flavorful and had more mushrooms than usual. The salad was typical. The shrimp appetizer consists of 3 small pieces of shrimp. While I greatly appreciated the extra snack, this addition does not really justify the price difference between this and other hibachi places. 

Our chef was perfectly capable, but not fun or talkative at all. Maybe it's not considered classy or upscale, but I like to have fun when I go to a place like this, and I appreciate chefs who make jokes, get creative, and talk to us while they're cooking. Our chef made good food, but he barely talked at all, and didn't really do anything exciting. He did the onion tower, but that's about it. 

The food was good, but nothing spectacular. My favorite thing was my boyfriend's spicy dish, because it came with these really delicious thick noodles. The spicy sauce is a creamy orange sauce that still has a lot of kick. It was delicious, actually. I wish I ordered that. The tuna steak was fine, but nothing to write home about. 

Overall, my experience was perfectly fine at this place, but when I pay this much for a meal I expect more than just an acceptable experience. There are plenty of places in and around the city where you can get similar meals for much cheaper. I probably won't go here again."
"PA","After my previous experience at Nakama the General Manager stepped up an showed outstanding customer service!  Im happy to say i will continue to eat at Nakama thanks to the upper management,  & for my love of the food, but im still upset i cant have my food exactly the way i want it."
"PA","I like Nakama, but you need to be ready for more of a bar / party type experience.

The hibachi is good.  The food is good.  It really comes down to the chefs.  They have a couple chefs that put on a crazy good show.  If you get one of them, you are in luck.  They each seem to have their quirks.  It isn't the typical show of a little bit of flame and a shrimp tail in the hat.

The sushi bar and regular bar are where Nakama really shines.  Nakama has a great bar scene and good sushi.  The sushi isn't the best in the city, but it is well done.  The fish to rice ratio is great and they have a diverse selection of pretty sushi rolls for people who want to go beyond your standard single fish product and rice.

I'd strongly recommend Nakama if you want some good sushi and drinks in a upscale busy bar environment.  If you are looking for an 'authentic' sushi / hibachi experience, this is not the place.  Nakama fits the Southside scene.  You hit Nakama before a club or party bar."
"PA","Great atmosphere and great sushi! I wanted to take my friend from out of town down south side and be on the classier side of things. We strolled around and decided on nakama. We love sushi and wanted a good cocktail! How could we go wrong here? We sat at the sushi bar and were waited on quickly. Our waitress was great and attentive but not annoying. She was considerate and asked us if we wanted separate checks which I always forget to ask upfront. My friend got the nakama Cosmo which she thought had too much sour mix. I had the French kiss, it was great. Sweet and sour but not overly sweet. We then split three sushi rolls and seaweed salad. Love seaweed salad. Sweet and vinegary with a good crunch. We got the basic salmon roll, Hawaiian roll and haiku roll. They were so delicious and very fresh. Came quickly too on a very busy Saturday night. Great place to get hibachi with a group of friends or intimate for a date! Not the cheapest option for good sushi is south side but the atmosphere makes it very worthwhile!"
"PA","Went here with my BFF for her birthday. Cocktails were great, just a little heavy on the sour mix.  I got the house Cosmo and my friend had the French Kiss cocktail.  The French Kiss was tastier than mine.  I loved the atmosphere: dim lighting, a swanky bar and hibachi tables in the back.  Self seating around the bar so we didn't have to wait at all at 9pm on a Saturday night. Rolls are big and are a decent price and the fish is super fresh. Two of the rolls tasted exactly the same which was a little disappointing: the Hawaii roll and the Haiku roll. If you want more variety don't order them together. Overall, Would recommend!!"
"PA","Ive been a V.I.P. customer and frequent lover of Nakama for over 6 yrs now. I have spent a lot of $$ at this place. Ive always loved their service and food...Until now. My Finace and i were there for my Birthday dinner last night, i ordered my regular meal the way ive ordered it the past 6 yrs. The waitress informs me that i cant order my fried rice without the veggies anymore. I asked to speak with a Manager and a gentlemen named Chris comes to speak with us. (10 min later busy playing online poker) he saus he gets too many complaints from the Chefs that prepare the food about things like this?  I said arent the chefs paid to do what you tell them?  I even offered to pay addtional to have my meal the way i wanted it. I told Chris it was my Birthday and ive spent thousands of dollars here at his establishment.  He didnt care he said its a new rule although its NOT online and not posted anywhere on the menu. We ended up staying and eating my Birthday dinner the way Chris wanted it not me. But this is the last time we will ever be back. Waste of 2 hours driving waste of time ruined.my Birthday dinner. Bad customer service bad business ethics Mr. Chris."
"PA","If you want Benihana's in Pittsburgh, I guess this is the place to go. Other than the fact that they have some marketing and advertising genius who's greased the palms of every ""guide to the city"" and ""best restaurants"" free pamphlet that they hand out at hotel concierge desks, I don't know what all the hype's about. 

They have a big sushi bar area, and quite a few grills in the back. We sat at a table with some PITT football players and I ordered the filet, while TY got surf and turf. It was all kind of eh, but I have to say that customer service was very good and all the staff were really nice. The filet was tender, but I think just the flavor of everything was mediocre, especially at their prices. We had a coupon for $15 in one of the aforementioned guide books, so pick one of those up before you spend your money here."
"PA","ICK--avoid this place.  I took one bite of the sushi and stopped eating it.  It tasted funny and waaaaaay fishy.  Our chef wasn't Asian but some white guy who didn't knock my socks off.  All he did was toss some high sodium sauce on some veggies and meat, stir them around, and serve them on our plates.  My stomach hurt less than 1 hour after I ate there...'nuff said."
"PA","The food is great if you are there for food and if it was still 2005.  The sushi is sub-par and on more than one occasion I've left their feeling a bit ill from it. 

As another reviewer wrote, ""Nakama has turned into a singles scene. ""  I don't understand this phenomenon either as if you are there for more than 5 minutes you cannot go anywhere else without smelling like the inside of that place. You also have to wash your clothes twice to get it out, it's almost worse than cigarette smoke."
"PA","I've tried to like Nakama, I really have. There is a serious shortage of good sushi in the Southside.....as in there are only two places to go for it. With the renovation and new ownership of the old Sushi Two into Tokyo Bistro, Nakama has dropped to last place (or 2nd), for Sushi in south side. 

Nakama has style. The interior is gorgeous. This is where it all ends and goes south though. The food is very uninspired, the waits for a table are unbelievable (and unwarranted), presentation has gone downhill over the years - and the worst part: the crowd.

For some reason, Nakama has turned into a singles scene. Please explain to me how a sushi & hibachi restaurant is now a meat-market? (fish market? hehe) Any given night of the week, you will find scantily clad fake women (could be a good thing), and old rich perverts trying to pick them up......cougars, suburbanites, screaming children....it's nuts. At peak dinner hours, you literally have to fight your way through everything. You'd think you stepped into Town Tavern by accident or something!

The other issue, and the reason why I am marking it bad for groups, is the lack of larger tables dedicated solely to sushi eaters. If you have a large group of people, you may as well pass. You can either camp out and wait for a bunch of seats to open up at the sushi bar, or sit at a hibachi grill - which is terrible for the cook if everyone in your party wants sushi.

Here are some final pros to balance this out a little bit and explain why I gave it two stars:

- Great drinks...best bloody mary I've had.
- Awesome for late night food once it clears out
- Good lunch specials
- The aforementioned interior space

But if you really want good sushi, go to Umi in Shadyside or Pennsylvania Fish Company on Penn Ave in the strip. Nakama is not the place."
"PA","I go here a few times a month, mostly because I think the bar scene is probably one of the most fun in Pittsburgh.   It gets pretty crowded especially on the weekends, but the staff does a good job especially after you go there a few times and they know who you  are.  It's the only place I know of in Pittsburgh that on any given day (even a monday or tuesday) there will be a good crowd at the bar with a higher girl to guy ratio than the usual dudefest at most bars.  The hibachi is better than most.  It's definitely better than benihana, but probably not as good as Shogun in Monroeville.  The only thing I don't like about the hibachi (or any hibachi) is that after the meal you smell like a diner short order cook because of the oil from the grill.  The other menu items are pretty average at best.  The marinated beef tips and chicken lettuce wraps are okay appetizers.  The edaname is pretty hard to mess up and the miso soup is about average.  The sushi is awful.  I mean I guess the rolls are edible, but you can hide the quality by adding a lot of junk to cover up the flavor.  The sashimi (whish is really all that I order) I found to be really poor quality and the way it was sliced was not at all how sashimi should be sliced.  I really don't understand how this place wins best overall restaurant and best sushi  in Pittsburgh.  It really makes no sense.  Most of the people I know agree that the hibachi is good, but overall the restaurant isn't that good and the sushi not good at all.  However, I have a  friend who is one of the chefs assures me that the quality of ingredient is good.  Overall, I suggest if you eat here the hibachi is pretty good and fun if  you are having a sit down dinner.  If you are eating at the bar try to stick to the edamame or maybe one of the appetizers mentioned.  I strongly suggest staying away from the sushi, but if you  must stick to the most basic of rolls (california roll, etc.).  In fact, if you are not sitting down for hibachi go eat at Dish on the same street and head to Nakama only for the bar."
"PA","Ugh this place is so overrated! It's cool that they cook in front of you and everything but the quality of the food is not great!!! I've been here twice for friends birthday dinners and I don't know why they like it here so much. The service is awful and everything is so overpriced!!! If I never go here again I would be fine with it but I bet one of my girlfriends will drag me here again"
"PA","This review is only for the sushi bar!

The first time I was here, the sushi tasted AMAZING! The Baked Alaska Roll was topped with salmon that had a smoky taste, which gave the roll an extra kick. I've came back twice to get the same roll, but it no longer had the smoky taste...perhaps it was by accident that the first time tasted so perfect!

I've also had the Boston Roll, Hanalei Roll, Pittsburgh Penguin Roll, and probably a couple more.. don't remember. They consistently have a good balance of ingredients and sauce. 

Presentation was great. Last time, I had my rolls spread out on the plate in the shape of a giant flower hehe

Service was always fine, never have to wait too long for the dishes. I always come here if I'm in the area.. even if I've already had dinner, just to get a sushi roll to-go!"
"PA","I've been to Nakama three times in the last four years, and I have to say I've had some mixed experiences from visit to visit. Nothing outright horrendous, but I've never had a perfect meal here, either.

During my first visit a family member and I sat in the window and enjoyed a quiet meal on a Saturday afternoon. My only complaint then was that there were no indications about just how big each order of sushi on the menu was; as a result we ended up putting in a second round of orders to fill up our stomachs, because round one was pretty light. (This problem still exists - they don't specify how many rolls you get next to every item or even in the section header. My orders have definitely ranged in size over the years and it's really hard for me to judge how big their rolls are without images or numbering. Special rolls in particular are rarely the same size as regular rolls since they have special ingredients.)

At dinner during my second visit I couldn't hear anyone in my dinner group over the grills, voices and music. The food was ok but the main thing I remember about the evening is leaving with a headache from the noise. 

And my third and most recent visit, while mostly good, still wasn't quite spot on. On the plus side, presumably since it was a Monday evening it was relatively quiet and there was no loud or obnoxious music being blasted throughout the place. The chef making our dinner was very nice, he let his technique wow us and do most of the talking for him, and he occasionally engaged in polite conversation with us. I loved watching and listening to this gentleman and he was a huge improvement over the flirtatious comedic wannabe I dealt with at the last hibachi place I went to, which will remain nameless. The drink I ordered was delicious and based on the samplings I had from my family's meals, the hibachi orders were perfect - the meat was tender and juicy and everything was seasoned for flavoring and cooked just the way everyone wanted them. But like I said, the meal wasn't spot on. My sushi, the Hawaiian roll, was ok, although I wish there had been more tempura evenly distributed throughout it. Our waitress actually messed up part of my order - I got a plate of salmon roll instead of the salmon cake, but I had waited long enough for my food while watching my family's hibachi being made that I didn't feel like complaining about it and sending it back. (On that note, if you come as a group, know that hibachi and normal orders never arrive anywhere near the same time. Order appetizers if you don't want to sit at the table drooling as your friends or family's dinner cooks in front of you.)

I've definitely never had an outright bad experience at Nakama and the food has always been tasty enough, particularly the hibachi - but honestly I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here and it'll probably be another year or two before I stop by again. And while Nakama hasn't completely and utterly disappointed me, it just haven't ""wowed"" me yet, either."
"PA","Sat at one of the tables by the window.... I had the cucumber salad, shrimp egg rolls and ahi tuna... All were very delicious! Nice portion of the cucumber salad and the egg rolls were so crispy and the sauce was so yummy!  I'm new to ahi tuna and it was just what I was expecting, I left very happy :) my boyfriend had the shrimp hibachi he cleared the whole plate and not to mention it's really nice you can order hibachi at one of the tables in the front. Our server was nice and she really made sure we had a great time! Can't wait to go back again"
"PA","Service was terrible and will not be returning.  Bad experience"
"PA","Sushi was average. I ate at the bar & the service was poor..very rushed; non attentive..had 2 ask for utensils 3x to 3 different staff, had to ask for soy dish..and no meal follow-up."
"PA","After an afternoon Pirates game, 3 of us sat up at the sushi bar and ordered fairly common sushi and sashimi. It was fresh and tasty. We also ordered a bowl of chicken fried rice that my husband claimed was the best he had ever had ( I think they cooked it with a LOT of butter). We watched the sushi chefs prepare way more interesting looking dishes while we waited for our food and enjoyed the atmosphere. Our waitress, Lauren, was a giant bag. That is my only complaint.  Not sure if we were just really luck to get the 3 seats as we walked in or what??  There was a constant line up in the waiting area so maybe we were lucky."
"PA","Excellent spot for hibachi and sushi with friendy staff and quick service.

The Chicken Diablo dinner was delicious"
"PA","I went there with my son because he really wanted to go.  He loves sushi and is always excited about flying food, so what better place to go, right?

And it's always packed, which means it must be good, right? 

Overall I'd say wrong.

The sushi was about the same quality that I get at Giant Eagle.  You know the kind... ""I'm really jonesin for some sushi, but I guess I'll take the old salmon stuck on top of crunchy cold rice because I'm too lazy to put my ass in the car and drive to Sushi Kim or some other real sushi bar.""

The hibachi: Quality level on par with Benihana.  Enough said.  It reminds me of what a chef friend of mine said about the Spaghetti warehouse one day: ""Fancy Ragu"".  The hibachi was fancy canned chop suey.

Oh, and the price.  One adult and one 14 year old lunch (2 small plates of sushi and 2 hibachi lunches) $80.00.  Someone hand me the Astroglide.  Quick.

I've been sampling these kinds of establishments on both coasts for the past 15 years, from Vancouver BC to San Diego, from Miami to Boston.  For what they charge, the quality should be much better and the staff should TRY to smile once in a while.  Sorry, honey, but tight skirt and 17 layers of makeup can't hide a mean heart.

Here ends the rant prescribed by this reviewer for this restaurant."
"PA","You would think by the crowds in this place it was the only sushi place in the whole city of Pittsburgh. I went in with good expectations of this place considering it is always crowded.....boy was I wrong!!!

First off the service at this place is horrible. This is mostly a 22-28 yr old staffed place. The hostess basically laughed at me when I said we did not have a reservation, offered us to have a drink at the bar, and then said ""but you cannot stand around in this area here around the door it is getting too crowded so either the bar or maybe wait outside"" ...seriously you don't tell a customer that. 

We just wanted sushi anyways, so we sat at the sushi bar and ordered some rolls and sashimi. Now maybe I am spoiled from living on the west coast for so long now that I am used to Asians (usually Japanese..go figure) working and making my sushi. There were 3 white guys about 25 yrs old making my rolls for me, not to say they cannot do it as well as anyone else, but the rolls were seriously not that great.  Hell I did not even see an Asian person working at the tables either, they were mostly Mexican guys. 

Sorry, I know most of the reviews are raving about how good this place is, but to me it seems pretty pricey for what you get and the food is not all that. I can only speak for the sushi...maybe the dinners at the tables are better. To sum it up this is mostly an over priced sushi bar that is a good place to hang out and have drinks with friends and maybe hit on some groups of women out for dinner."
"PA","My sister & I went to the sushi bar on a Sunday afternoon and I was quite pleased. The chefs at the bar were very friendly and chatty (though I'm sure that had something to do with how empty the place was), and we got a ton of sushi for under $40. My sister got the spider rolls and I ended up stealing a few because they were so tasty. I live in Chicago, and the prices were pretty comparable to cheaper sushi there, so it was a great deal. My sister keeps saying we have to go back over the holidays, and I definitely agree!

EDIT: So we went back on Saturday and this time shared the maki platter, some Spider rolls, and the Hanalei rolls.

The hanalei rolls were by far the best sushi I have ever had. I am still having dreams about them.

That's all."
"PA","So...  I usually only eat in the Sushi bar/bar area because I am not into the whole hibachi thing.  This place is usually very busy for Happy Hour, so if you just want to eat and not worry about a crowd, try a different place or come at a different time.  Otherwise, it can be amusing to people watch here.  

Personally, I come for the Sushi.  Ever since my friend introduced me to the Hanalei roll, I can't resist it.  Shrimp tempura, cream cheese, some other stuff, then tempura batter fried.  Tastes so much better than it sounds, worth the $14 price tag (if done right) as it is double the standard sized roll.  The other rolls are all decent and the sashimi servings are huge.  If you are on a first date, beware - the pieces of sushi are so gigantic that you'll either 1) look like a pig stuffing it all into your mouth or 2) risk having the entire piece fall apart all over you as you try to daintily take normal bite sizes out of the sushi-piece.  You decide whether you will go for option 1 or 2!  Oh, and just say NO to the tempura appetizer.  It's not tempura, that would actually be Japanese style.  No, what you will get if you order the tempura is American-style beer-battered shrimp and 3 pieces of vegetables, all for 11 bucks.  Blech.

Service is always a bit shoddy in the bar area, but to be fair, that place gets crazy busy.  So...  Food, 4; Service 2-3 depending on the night and business; atmosphere, 3.  But hey, if you just want that busy happy hour scene, this is a place to go to!  P.S.  Parking can be a pain.  It's Carson in the Southside, what do you expect?"
"PA","Avoid the hibachi and save yourself from the rest of the night on the toliet! 

Had the hibachi sesame chicken, my husband had the hibachi steak. First course onion soup was super salty, tasted like it was hot water with beef ramen seasoning. Salad was decent enough. Veggies served first then meat. Bland- nothing special. Certainly not worth $50. They also serve this nasty ""shrimp sauce"" which is basically thousand island dressing. I was worried about the food safety on the hibachi ""chef's"" cart. Kinda grimey-lookin.  Worst part was that later that night, both of us got sick from eating there. I'm talking sick like from the movie Bridesmaids.  It was bad. Spend your money elsewhere."
"PA","I think that this was closer to a 3 start restaurant but given the amount my father spent I can't give it 3 stars.  I booked this place for 6 adults and 2 kids because I thought the kids would really enjoy the experience.  We were in town celebrating my 40th birthday.  It is extremely loud which I expected, but didnt help the experience.  While our chef was nice enough, he didnt provide the ""show"" that you are also paying for and I feel the kids didnt get the full experience.  The food was good...however 2 of us ordered our filet medium and it was way overcooked.  

Overall, it was a decent meal but I dont think we would return."
"PA","The hanalei roll is my favorite sushi roll anywhere ever. Sushi is always fresh. Hibachi  is average. I don't get why people like the atmosphere. I like going here only when it's not very busy."
"PA","Nakama tries to be very trendy, but I have experienced much better sushi for a better price.  Still, the sushi is better than many people claim.  I had very good service here.  And there is some great people watching.  But we have much better choices for Japanese food in Pittsburgh."
"PA","Never coming back :( I've given this place so many chances. I remember years ago when the sushi and service was great, now the only good thing about it here is there hot food. If you go here, they have very tasty lunch entrees, that's it, and be ready for iffy service. I went last week and sat at the bar in clear view of the bartender who was too busy playing on his phone to greet me. I got a sashimi platter and boston roll. I ate two pieces of sashimi, the second bite I had to spit into a napkin, I couldn't bring myself to swallow it. The boston roll was okay, but not very cool. Even the sashimi was above room temp and very fishy and just bad. I'm a service industry employee myself, you have to be pretty shitty for me to give a bad review....it was that bad, sorry bout it :("
"PA","Over rated.  In most cases you get what you pay for except here, you pay more for average at best sushi.  The waitress had a terrible attitude and a face to match.  Yokoso is shitting on this place.  Not to mention have fun trying to find a decent parking spot on the southside."
"PA","A group of four of us went to dinner before a show in the south side. We alerted our server to our time window and she said no problem. Our servers attentiveness was minimal and we didn't require a lot. Our meals were okay but nothing special. When the bills came our prices were different than on the menu and when we asked our server about it she told us that we each had a $3.50 up charge for ordering fried rice rather than the white rice the meals came with. Our server never mentioned the up charge and she asked us which type of rice we would prefer! She was very rude about it in the end and never apologized or anything. We will spend our money elsewhere when we go to the next show."
"PA","I have been to Nakama for many happy hours in my earlier professional days.  Recently, I arrived for sushi with my friend Katie around 7:30 PM on a Thursday (great downtime to get a seat at the bar following their popular happy hour).  This was an impromptu outing after assisting Katie with some logistics for this year's Silk Screen Gala & Film Festival.  We started with beverages and placed an order of edamame.  They definitely place a good amount of sea salt on those green soy goodies, which I LOVE.  Thursday is ladies night, which allows 1/2 off of a selection of mixed drinks, beers and/or house wines.  Together, we surveyed the area, making up fun and comical stories about our fellow bar patrons.  #Goodtimes

Next, we placed our order for sushi (the main entrée), cleansing our palates each with  a salad.  I had the Nakama salad with their yummy ginger dressing.  Katie had a spectacular cucumber salad, mixed with soy sauce, sesame seeds and red pepper bites.

Finally, the sushi arrived in its artistic and flawless state.  Fresh and colorful, we each chose 2 types (totaling 4): Asparagus Tempura, Spicy Tuna Roll, Baked Alaskan (our favorite), and a Hawaiian roll. Nakama has a moderate to high price point which makes sense, due to their prime location in Pittsburgh's South Side neighborhood and terrific ambiance.  I will definitely be going back.  Oh, and knowing that we ate so healthy (minus the salt and soy sauce) made for a non-bloated ride home.  #30somethingproblems

Review can be found on my website as well:  http://wp.me/p43vGR-YX"
"PA","Trendy ambiance, fresh sushi, but the worst hibachi I've ever had.

First with my sushi review: I have been here multiple times for sushi and liked the bar set up and thought the sushi tasted fresh and the service was quick. Good for happy hours (especially Thursday specials) or dates. However I don't like how if you only want to order sushi you have to sit at the bar. It makes it impossible to go there as a group or you end up waiting forever if there aren't enough seats in the bar area.. when the entire back room could be open. 

The reason for my 2-star review is the hibachi, something that is pretty standardized among restaurants, but Nakama didn't have any of it right the time I went. The miso soup tasted like the packet cup of soup you buy in college. I ordered the shrimp and it turned out tough and rubbery. I also tried some of my friend's steak, which was also well done and dry. The hibachi chef didn't even ask how she wanted it to be cooked. Also, even though it's similarly priced to other hibachi restaurants, you have to up charge for fried rice and don't even have the option of noodles.

Bottomline: go to Nakama in small groups for sushi but stay away from the Hibachi"
"PA","this is the best pizza I have had in Pittsburgh! The pepperoni pizza was prefect. we ordered the twisties as well which were amazing. The bartender was very nice and the prices were great. Definitely worth a trip to the south side!"
"PA","We decided to try Michael's Pizza Bar & Restaurant one sunny Saturday this past summer.  A little off the beaten path running through the South Side you will find this little treasure.  First impressions, it's a quaint neighborhood bar.  The kind of place that if you live close you probably frequent.  I was really excited to try Michael's after hearing about their pizza. So that is where we laid our attention.

We ordered a large pie half cheese (for him) and the other half mushroom, onions, and banana peppers (for me).  Now I am like every other red blooded American, but pizza doesn't usually impress me.  It's ok, great to eat with beer, but I could never eat it regularly.  When I get pizza I like it to be thin crust, crisp, almost stand on its own, with veggies.  That being said Michael's delivered not only a pretty chill atmosphere but a pretty tasty pie.  Matt really liked the crust and the sauce.  I enjoyed the flavors as well, especially since they do not skimp on the toppings at all.  There was a plethora of veggies piled atop my pie.  This was good but came with its own set of challenges as the toppings weighed the pizza down, so there went my stand on its own factor.  That was ok it was still very scrumptious.  The one thing I really wish they would have done was use fresh mushrooms and not the canned ones.   

Funny thing happened as we were eating and enjoying some brews.  A couple with a few kids pulled up outside.  They left the door of their SUV open as their kids slept in the car while they had some pie at the outdoor table.  I laughed cause I would totally do the same thing."
"PA","This bar was tucked away off the main strip but it is worth the detour!!!!! The food was absolutely amazing! Make sure you get the breadsticks and the lil mini pizza. The sauce was very good. The portions are HUGE!!!! The loaded fries sure were loaded and the fries were fresh cut!!!! Do not miss this spot if you are in south side!"
"PA","I'll have to update this review after trying some other things on the menu. 

We stopped in for burger night (Monday) $1 burgers which include lettuce & tomato. All other toppings are 25cents.  I ordered mine with cheese, bacon & pickles. The burger was good especially for the deal. We also ordered the cheese fries which were tasty. I love fresh cut fries so I enjoyed them. Next time for burger night i'll probably order 2 but i honestly was full off of one burger and sharing our cheese fry.

The servers was nice as well. I will stop by again soon since it's so close to home."
"PA","I walk in and an older lady greets me and hands me a menu. The interior of this place is nice. An antique bar and funny signs placed about, and of course steelers memorabilia on the back wall. I ordered the specialty white lil Charlie personal pizza I think it was called. She insisted I add sausage as a topping so I did. I could not have asked for a better pizza in that moment and time. The Italian dressing and sausage complimented eachother perfectly. The dough is just right. Reasonably prices too. The fresh brewed tea was also good. The only downfall was that there were only two beers available, both on draft, Shock Top and Bud Light. She said they had just ran out of Yuengling. Bless her heart. I never knew bars ran out of Yuengling around these parts. I thought they drilled wells in the ground for it. Being a beer connoisseur, the selection didn't sit well with me. Otherwise, the experience was great for food only, and the bartender/waitress was laid back and friendly. Just how I like it. I tipped her 40%. She mentioned Thursdays being 80 cents a slice of plain cheese, so I may just stop in again tomorrow!"
"PA","Cool location but I found the pizza to be kinda average. The Italian hoagie was good. Parking was a nightmare."
"PA","I lived in Brooklyn and Staten Island most of my adult life. Ate pizza at least twice a week for lunch and once a week for dinner. With that said this would be above average pizza in my old stomping grounds. Great crust, quality mozz and tasty sauce. Cheap too. Add in the oldtime neighborhood bar feel and you get a great lunch and dinner experience."
"PA","Michael's is always a good cheap place to visit if in the South Side. It's nothing fancy and you won't find a four course meal, but it does the trick and that's all that really matters! 

If you're into traditional bar food and pizza, then this place is for you! They have great simple choices (with the exception of crazy pizza toppings) and you will most definitely find something that will satisfy your hunger. The atmosphere is a step above dive. It was a Friday night and there were a few people at the bar and and most tables were filled with only one bartender/server. I do think they should have had at least one other staff member behind the bar helping out. We ended up sitting outside at one of their outdoor tables. It was a beautiful night and we wanted to take advantage of the evening.

I ordered a personal pizza with green peppers and a basket of cheese fries. The pizza was cooked perfectly and I loved how they shredded the peppers very thin. The fries were great because you don't find many places that give you that fresh cut/Potato Patch type of fry. It was long overdue! My boyfriend ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with chips and a beer. He mentioned that it was okay, nothing special. The bun looked like a regular old sandwich bun you could have got in a plastic bag at Giant Eagle. I think the sandwich would have been more appetizing with a more gourmet type of bun. Still, for the price, you can't go wrong! The total bill was only $20!"
"PA","I regularly order their pizza special called a little charlie's... which is a small personal pan pizza w/ a large beverage. THIS! Their pizza is A-MAZING! This is the best pizza spot on the southside! 4-stars!"
"PA","Pizza is awesome here!  This place is hidden and I never even knew it was here!  I went there for lunch with some friends and it's such a nice little pizza/bar restaurant.  It reminded me going to my friends grandmothers house. It has that old bar feel, but to smell.  I suggest anyone who wants some good pizza to try this place out!"
"PA","I've been here twice so far and love the pizza. However, the service is not as great. Both times they accidentally slid the pizza off the plate onto the bar, but I was too hungry and nice for them to make another. My friend and I also had to explain what the ingredients were to the drinks we wanted. The servers at the time were a mom and daughter so I just didn't want to be mean and snobby to them at the time. I told them they could use their phones to get an app with plenty of drink ingredients included, they were really nice about it. Maybe I will get take out next time."
"PA","We went in here one night when we kind of stumbled upon it by accident while driving in the South Side.  Very casual atmosphere, lots of big screen TVs, quick and friendly service that isn't overly attentive nor was it non existent.  ""Hockey puck"" was delicious, pizza was great, Blue Moons were super fresh and delicious.  Very reasonable price, too!  Maybe our new favorite place!"
"PA","I love this Pizza.  I grew up in Carrick near Sunseri's pizza on Custer Ave.  I believe this place has or at one time had a family connection to that place.  They are similar, but unique enough to warrant a trip if you like Sunseri's.  The pizza is good, the sauce has a nice tangy oregano taste, bordering on sour, but in a good way.  The crust is soft and chewy.

If you go here and get nothing else, get the twisties.  They're hands down in the upper crust, pun intended, of bread sticks I've had.

Wings are good and tangy, but basic.  I prefer more depth of flavor than just buffalo, but they were cooked well, sauced properly and tasty.

They have some good specials too, slice nights, and hoagie deals.

Lastly, for some reason, I think that their fountain sodas are the best I've ever had.  No cola has ever tasted as good was what came from their fountain.  A small detail, but a perk nonetheless.

I've never had the salads there, but they look fantastic."
"PA","Great food and a real family experience. The pizza is amazing, I've been coming here for 18 years"
"PA","A local joint off of E Carson street.  My girlfriend lives near by so we go when we can.  Nothing fancy, just cheep drinks, good pizza, and a great staff.  A+"
"PA","The biggest issue we had and what made us leave sooner than we wanted were the myriad fruit flies buzzing around around the bar area.

Visited Michael's Pizza Bar mid June 2013 with a friend. We sat at the bar and were quickly helped. The service was great. We ordered the french fries (they were out of jalapeños) and a sausage and banana pepper pizza. We received the fries and the pizza at the same time. No problem...but the cook piled so many peppers on the pizza one couldn't see the pizza. The crust and sauce were good, but I found the sausage to be wanting."
"PA","Pizza and wings were good, staff was very friendly. We didn't order any of the calzones but they looked really good, will try them next visit."
"PA","I went here yesterday on a whim based off of the Yelp ratings. I must say, it definitely lived up to the ratings! 

We got a pepperoni pizza and the seasoned wings. The pizza sauce and dough were very good. The sauce was tangy and the dough was just the right consistency. I did think the pizza was too greasy, though (partially remedied by sopping up some of the grease with the dabbing napkin technique). I don't usually like sauceless/dry rub wings, but these were actually tasty! Not sure what exactly they put on them, but they were nice and crispy with sort of a seasoning salt flavor.

The other great thing about this place is the super cheap beer: a Yuengling and Shock Top draft for $2.50 each. Awww yeaah.

If you find yourself in the South Side and hungry for some pizza, check out Michaels."
"PA","I LOVE MICHAEL'S PIZZA & TWISTIES! The pizza crust, sauce and cheese are perfect. The pepperoni pizza or pepperoni and onion topping combination are also perfect. And those puffy, twisted cheese sprinkled baked dough twisties with the slightly gooey centers dipped in the delightful Michaels sauce are also perfect.

We've eaten here dozens of times and celebrated so many family milestones here over twisties, pizza and pitchers of Yuengling through the past several years. And we have Meghan, our favorite Saturday afternoon bartender. This little bar on the Southside holds a happy place in my heart.

In fact, most of my family members have also reviewed Michaels and have all given it 5 stars. My star deduction is solely based on one thing and to me it's a biggie - pizza toppings. My favorite pizza has always been pepperoni & mushrooms and they use canned mushrooms. I've tried multiple times to come up with a reasonable alternative and until we went with the onions, everything just fell short. I like jalapeños,they only have banana peppers. Tried the bacon and the spinach, nope not worthy. So pepperoni and onions it is! And I'm now a happy camper.

We've tried the hockey puck, a fried dough ball covered in sauce and its really good. The fried mac and cheese didn't do it for me & i can live with that. The hoagies come out weighing more than your head. If you enjoy a fully loaded hoagie, theirs may be your ticket to heavenly delight.

This little unassuming Southside gem on Sarah Street with the neon pink Michael's sign over the door is truly a happy find!"
"PA","the best pizza in pittsburgh."
"PA","Michael's Pizza Bar has pizza that is virtually unmatched. The crust, sauce, everything is perfect. The prices are great and the staff is so friendly. 

I used to live in Pittsburgh and would come here regularly on Saturday afternoons with my family. The server got to know our family and we always looked forward to catching up with her. Now that I'm in Chicago with tons of pizza options, Michael's still ranks towards the very best I've had. I make sure to dine here when I come back in town. 

Do yourself a favor- start with the twistys. I'm drooling just thinking about them."
"PA","If you are looking for good, cheap pizza, Michael's is your spot. I came here to experience what I had heard from several different people was the ""best pizza in Pittsburgh"". I usually prefer thin crust pizza so I wasn't expecting much, but this pizza was great. The crust and sauce was very sweet, the toppings were fresh, and it was all baked together to create a big gooey mess of deliciousness. It did take a while for our food to come out (not sure if that is typical), but the price is right, and the staff is friendly, so I didn't mind waiting."
"PA","Solid pizza and great prices.  The pizza has just the right amount of dough, cheese, sauce, and preferred toppings.  This is what I consider pan style pizza non- thick variety...good stuff!  The atmosphere here is more dive bar but cozy at the same time.  Service is good...jukebox in the corner.  I like this spot."
"PA","This is a review I didn't ever want to write.  This place is just too good. You know, pizza is something we all have a standard against which all others are measured. And the search for that perfect pizza is much like the search for the fountain of youth - elusive but clearly worthwhile. Michael's has restored my faith that perhaps that fountain of youth does exist - the perfect pizza certainly does! And Michael's has it! Sure, there's good pizza all over the place. But there's only one BEST pizza. I've had pizza all over Pittsburgh, all over the US (NYC, Chicago, SoCal...) and all over Europe including Italy. I've had Monte Cello's VIncent's, Domenico's, Luciano's, Mineo's, and all the chains - although I do like Piccolo Forno's too. My search has not been half-hearted nor without focus. I stumbled upon Michaels about 8 years ago and hit the motherlode. When I want pizza, I'm willing to drive the 25 miles from the north hills to the south side just to sit and enjoy my favorite pizza with a pitcher of Yuengling in a comfy bar atmosphere.

I wanted to keep this place to myself, not to tell anyone about it. After all, hidden gems are meant to remain hidden, right? Otherwise people swarm in and spoil a good thing. No one wants to go somewhere where everyone goes!! But alas, I find myself after 8 years of going here as a regular, finally wanting to shout it out!! THIS IS GREAT PIZZA!!! 

Two blocks off Carson street on Sarah, it's off the beaten path and is not a place you're likely to just happen upon. You have to look for it. But once you do, you'll be hooked. First off, the crust is perfect, not too thin, not thick and doughy. It's a delight. The sauce is what make it. One thing I know it's sauce. And this is remarkable. Order the twisty's as an appetizer - parmesan dusted baked dough twists that are to die for - and you'll get a side of the sauce. Go ahead, dip in. You'll thank me. I could eat a bowl of that sauce with a tablespoon. And ask for more. This pizza just kills!! And if Meghan is working there, you'll be treated to the best service with a smile. She is absolutely the best. Good pizza, good service, good beer, good atmosphere. I call that JACKPOT!! What more could you want? 

If I have to wait for a table next time, I'll know I should have kept this secret to myself!!"
"PA","Best pizza I've ever had. No question.

I lived in the South Side for a few years, and I would eat at Michael's every weekend. I was a regular to the point that when I'd walk in, they wouldn't even bring me a menu, they'd just put in my order. Even after I moved to the North Side, I would still try to make the trip for the best pizza in Pittsburgh. 

While the restaurant itself isn't fancy, modern, or fussy (although they underwent some minor renovations in the past 2 years), the food is crave worthy. As appetizers go, it's hard to go wrong with the twistees. Ahhh, the twistees. Michael's delicious dough twisted into golden ribbons, dusted with Parmesan and baked until perfect. Served with the best pizza sauce I've ever had the pleasure of devouring. The hockey puck is also a pretty excellent prelude to your pizza. A seasoned, golden brown fried chunk of deliciousness shaped like a...well, you get the idea.  The pizza is perfection. The sauce is outrageously good, the cheese is a great quality, creamy blend, and the dough is consistently perfectly cooked. I could eat a whole pizza, it's THAT good. In fact, I have eaten a whole medium pizza in one sitting during the Michael's Pizza Challenge. Just to get a silly tshirt. I'm still proud of my accomplishment!

The service is always great, Megan is an especially attentive and personable waitress. Great place to watch a game, grab a pitcher, and enjoy the finest pizza in Pittsburgh.

P.S. Michael's, I miss you...I'll be back once I'm off my diet :)"
"PA","I think therefore I am...a pizza fan.  I just made a rhyme, wish I could do that every time.  See what I did there?

Michael's the quintessential neighborhood restaurant.  It is large enough to accommodate a crowd without losing it's intimacy.  We went on Friday (3/2/12) and there were two delightful people working and we were always well-attended.  And then there's the pizza...

My friend and I split a buffalo chicken pizza.  I commiserate with you if you've never tried such a pizza and feel you should rectify the situation; Michael's is a fantastic place to do so.  The crust was perfect--slightly doughy on the inside with just enough crustiness on the outside.  The cheese was solid enough so it stayed on the pizza yet was compliant enough to get those beloved strings when pulling your bite from the remaining slice.  The top surface was blanketed with perfectly cooked chicken.  Finally, the buffalo (in lieu of marinara) sauce had a great flavor, enough heat to keep you on your toes but not so much to kill your taste buds and preventing your pizza bliss.  Describing the ingredients doesn't quite do the pie justice--there is definitely pizza synergy going on here.

Alas, I do have to knock one start from the rating because this is a BAR and restaurant.  In my opinion, bars have evolved into carrying a large selection of beer and typically have more than a few taps.  Although I didn't do a thorough search, it seemed as though Michael's only carried the typical domestics that I have grown to disdain.  Pretentious?  Perhaps, but it's what I like.  In saying that, Michael's appears to keep it's corner bar image with a close, local clientele who may prefer domestic beer.  If so, Michael's caters to their customers' tastes and I commend them.

Try this place for your next pizza craving."
"PA","Good hoagies, great pizza.  I highly recommend any of their specialty pizzas.  Their pierogie pizza is second to none and the turkey club pizza can't be beat.  Even when they are busy, the kitchen has a pretty quick turn around.  It's a great little place to hang out or just to get a pie to go."
"PA","This place is great. The pizza is in the top 3 in Pittsburgh and may even be number one. The price is great.It's a hidden gem on the south side and well worth the trip. My mouth is watering just thinking about it."
"PA","Oh, Michael's. Lovely delicious Michael's. I have long drawn out dreams about the crispy crust, the perfect amount of sauce, and bubbly slightly burnt cheese.

I feel the real test of a pizza place is a plain cheese of a pepperoni pizza. Michael's goes above and beyond on that pizza alone. Not too greasy. On our last venture we decided to branch out and try the... Mashed Potato Pizza. While not an all the time option, it was amazing. Michael's regular crust topped with mashed potatoes, covered in cheddar and mozzarella cheese, real bacon, and a (as much as I hate this word) dollop of sour cream. Beautiful. 

In additional to the great pizza, they have cheap beers too. The usual liquor options too.

The interior is small but cozy. It has the appearance of a dive bar, but I don't think I'd call it a dive. They have a lot of kitschy decor. Pizza pillows on the window seat, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's Pizza Time clock. The first room has the bar and a few tables, there is also a little room to the back where more tables are located if you don't want to sit in the bar area. They've got a few tv's so if you're into sports you can stay updated as well.  Keep in mind Wednesday is 50 cent wing night and Thursday night's are the pizza special so those two nights can get a little packed. 

My only other tip would be that while Yelp says they deliver, and my friend's confirm that sometime's they have in the past, when I called and asked they told me no. So, that may be a hit or miss situation.

Just look for the red neon Michael's sign off the beaten path of Carson Street."
"PA","Michael's is great for what it is: a dive bar that serves great pizza. 

Their beer selection is small, service can be slow, and salad dressing comes in packets. 

However, they make one hell of a pizza! Really tasty dough, zesty sauce, and baked just right. On Thursdays, they have pizza by the slice.

Michael's has a large menu complete with deep fried appetizers, salads, and sandwiches. They aren't bad, but I'd stick to what they do best."
"PA","The dough they use is wonderful.  The Thursday special is 50 cent slices: just sit down and tell your waitress how many and what you want to drink with them.  This was a favorite lunch outing when I worked in the South Side.  Other recommended menu items are the Twisties (soft, baked sticks of pizza dough you can drip in marinara sauce) and the Hockey Puck (a hockey puck shaped lump of deep fried dough drowned in marinara sauce).

You automatically get cool points for eating here since it isn't directly on Carson Street, but be forewarned that this alone does not prevent the place from getting crowded, especially on Thursdays.

I once ordered a calzone from Michael's and ate it over the course of two days.  Those were a good two days."
"PA","I go to the Rex on a frequent basis.  One of my favorite places to see a show!!   Awesome sound.  Awesome lights.  Not a bad view in the house.  Great friendly staff and a great selection of brews.  Great eclectic mix of artists that perform here.  Definitely check it out."
"PA","Saw Andy McKee here the other day. The place is pretty divey, but exactly what I expected. The sound system was good, and the place was small enough to be intimate. They have drinks available too, which is always a plus.

Definitely going back."
"PA","This was a really interesting space. We all agreed that this place was simply too cool for us."
"PA","I had a great time at the Rex.  I wasn't sure what to expect from the Rex Theater but I remember growing up on the Southside and my grandma taking me to see movies here when I was very young so I at least knew it would be very theater like.

There was some awkward construction happening in the rare of the theater what looked to be a newly constructed bar that took away from the scenery a bit."
"PA","I went out to see a show last weekend (21+). I'm not 21, but I had called the theater earlier in the week to see if I could still attend the show and I was told to call back on the day of the show. the morning of the show I called the theater again and asked if I could go, and I was told that they would mark my hands and warn the staff that I was there so I couldn't drink. They said they're legally allowed to have up to 10 underage people at the venue by PA state law... I didn't care about that, just wanted to see the show. When I got to the door I was told I couldn't attend the show. I was disappointed for sure, but the generous staff at The Rex offered me a few free tickets to an upcoming show for compensation. After acknowledging my bad experience, they did everything they could to make it better, which makes a quality staff (and a quality venue) in my opinion. I look forward to seeing more shows at The Rex for sure!"
"PA","Just as DC has The Black Cat and Atlanta has Lenny's (RIP), Pittsburgh has the Rex. I came here for the first time to see Swans just the other day- good times, loud times! It's a little bit scuzzy but hey, sometimes it's better that way. The box office closes up after the show gets going so if you're a late-comer, better have your tickets on hand. The place wasn't air conditioned from what I could tell (or feel) and there was a giant industrial sized fan near the theater doors. I'd be up for checking out another show here when I'm in town. 

Bonus: they sell Rex koozies at the bar!"
"PA","i like this place as a music venue. it's small, so it is intimate, but it's big enough that everyone has room to dance and mill around.
when you enter the venue, to your right is the 21+ section with a bar (although i hear talk that they are building another bar in the stage area as well) and to your left is the stage area. the two areas are sectioned off and there's no smoking, not even in the bar.
the stage area is pretty cool, like i said, small but big enough. they get pretty cool bands here a lot as well, good mix of different kinds of music."
"PA","The Rex is basically a little old theater that's been completely deconstructed and remixed... not entirely successfully.

Entering the venue I was very confused when my ticket was taken by the ""box office"" lady and then the big dude at the actual entrance point wanted nothing to do with my ID.  I later (like 2 seconds later) discovered that the alcohol section is cordoned off away from the stage by some sort of trampy sheer fabric membrane.  Big bummer.

On the plus side -- the floor is slanted slightly which makes it easier for the shorter among us to see the action on the stage.  Also, street parking nearby was not terribly hard to come by which was a pleasant surprise.

Overall the experience left me without a strong urge to come back, but if I happened to be in Pittsburgh and someone good was playing I wouldn't completely avoid it either."
"PA","This is a great Pittsburgh venue that caters to all types of music lovers! the sound and lighting are really good and have made for some awesome and entertaining nights. 

the bar is nice and recently started adding a decent Microbrew selection. I had some good local ones there like East End Brewery and Full Pint. Would be nice if it was non-smoking, but that's the way bars seem to be going in Pittsburgh.

Highly recommended! Check out their schedule and you'll find great bands and DJ's!"
"PA","Always a good time. Bar area is small and crowded but worth it to see all the cool acts that come through this venue."
"PA","Recently caught a show at the (relatively) recently renovated Rex Theater, marking my first show there. I have to say, I'm a pretty big fan of the venue. As you enter, to the right there is a bar area and to the left a stage: A small, square room with a slightly slanted floor and a balcony behind it. Ideally the slanted floor should give shorter people in the back a better view, and I have to say that while I am a taller person, the view from the back was excellent, giving a full view of the stage.

The house lighting is decent and the soundsystem is LOUD for the space with great bass, which makes it pretty good for dance music and such. Unfortunately, I spent most of my time too close to the stage to actually hear how it sounded, so I can't comment on it being any better than loud.

Didn't really notice the staff, which is always a good thing. They get a fairly decent variety of shows here as well, working with Grey Box Productions. Apparently they do some non-music events.

Definitely worth catching a show here, in a town with quite a few venues worth missing a show at.

Oh and venue capacity is probably about 500-600"
"PA","I came here not long ago with friends and my awesome man Darren W. (hi sweetie) and had a blast watching excellent Pretty Things Peepshow.  The place seems ancient, but that's what gives it a great vibe. I just wish they had more metal shows here. I'm tired of Diesel."
"PA","Every time I have gone, I have had adequate space to move around and dance. The sound is good, lights are okay. My biggest problem is the bar area - it's all the way outside, next to the lobby in a small, cramped area with a net that separates the bar from the entrance of the dance hall. I don't like missing out on all the action every time I have to get a drink."
"PA","I went to see the glitch mob here, good venue, good drinks"
"PA","The Rex Theater is one of the best venues in Pittsburgh for electronic artists. The floor is large enough to accommodate a decent crowd, but they never oversell the events so there is always room to breathe (even if the show sells out). The sound system and lighting are adequate, and the drinks are reasonably priced compared to other ""club"" venues. Recently, I've seen The Glitch Mob and Designer Drugs. Both shows were a blast. The biggest con is trying to find South Side parking on a Thurs-Sat night."
"PA","August 28th Dubstep show with DATsiK better be there gonna be pure filth"
"PA","I recently went to the Trombone shorty show at the rex and was pleasantly surprised with the changes that have been made.  The sounds and lighting systems have all been upgraded with care.  Mostly what I know about the place is that there are some really great acts going through that venue.  More and more I see myself looking into who is playing there because as a venue its pretty rockin!  Check it out."
"PA","I've never had a bad time at the rex.  The drinks at the bar are pretty pricey here.  It's non-smoking, now, which is actually good.  Whether there are chairs set up or it's SRO, the shows fill up and it's not TOO crowded to enjoy it.  They usually have an interesting array of bands that come through, a lot of good jazz.  Definately a place to check out if you're new or visiting pittsburgh."
"PA","i like the rex. 

it used to be a movie theatre. i like how the floor is slanted. cause it helps a tiny bit being able to see over tall people in front of you.

(they have since taken the seats out)

they have awesome lighting usually too.

but i haven't been there much recently. because most of the shows are 21+. 

although they let me in once with my mommy. haha."
"PA","Best place for some electronica beats."
"PA","I really love Rex Theater! I went to see Andy McKee and it was just a phenomenal show- the space, the artist, the venue- everything was on point! The venue is spacious and perfect to see a small band or performer! For Andy McKee, there were folding chairs lined in three sections with a capacity for about 80-100 people. Although this event had a large crowd, it was spacious enough that you didn't feel squished. I also saw the Jonas Brothers here before the hype surrounded them, so there were not many people, making it very roomy! You could stand in the front or stand back and would still see the performer perfectly. If there was a bigger band here, I think the space could get a bit crowded, but I think that's why the Rex doesn't cater to big performers. It is the perfect place to see an unknown band just to experience the theater and sample some new music!"
"PA","This is a great small venue for local Pittsburgh bands, I've been there frequently because my son is in the band called"" The Semi-Supervillains "" if you haven't checked them out yet, you must there pretty good!  Its nice at the Rex, you can get up nice and close to the stage to enjoy the show!  They have some all age shows"
"PA","CASH ONLY.  But it does include an ATM, with rather minimal ATM fees. 

Once of my favorite places in the city.  Very cool atmosphere.  My favorite event, the moth, is held here once a month.  There are also various performances - with a rather eclectic mix of groups at a very reasonable price."
"PA","Some friends and I caught a show here over the weekend and we weren't disappointed. This was actually my first visit to the Rex, a decent smaller venue on the Sah Side.

Getting in was fairly easy...short line, ID check, will-call ticket pick-up, hand stamp and we were good to go. My one friend bought the first round of drinks at the small bar behind the entrance and I took care of the second round (PBR tall boys to mix in with the hipster crowd) from the busier bar at the back of the open auditorium. Prices were about what you'd expect.

Nothing fancy about the interior, but the sound was very good and the packed house, including us, had a great time. Too easy. 3.5 Stars."
"PA","I've been to several different Starbucks in the city and this one is definitely my favorite. The baristas are friendly and quick. They also take the extra time to ask your name and remember your fav drink. ** With a special mention to Clarissa or Carista? Forgive me I'm horrible with names but she's truly first rate with treating customers better than expected!! I also like the cozy atmosphere... Several leather chairs to relax in which is great. Only wish it had a fireplace for cold days. Plus it has clean bathrooms!"
"PA","This starbucks seems to be more consistent than most other local Starbucks as far as quality. The staff is always quick with a friendly greeting. They usually have your order ready before you make it to the end of the counter."
"PA","I love this Starbucks location above many others. I always get what I order, the drinks are consistent, and tasty. It's within walking distance for me, which is a huge plus.

The staff is usually very friendly as well. Yeah it's a bit pricey, but I know what I'm getting is going be done quick, and taste good."
"PA","i am not sure why I even go to Starbucks anymore. Do I really need to pay ten dollars for hot sugar water. I probably could have gone somewhere else for less and gotten better coffee. The food can be over priced and ridiculous and stuff. 

It is such an unnecessary kind of place. There are so few reasons in ths world to really understand the power behind a small business until you see the flaw in such a large company."
"PA","Great staff"
"PA","Pretty good Starbucks.  I generally get my coffee to go and it comes out quick, hot, and bold.  

Stayed for the wifi once.  It worked.

It is a Starbucks.

Wish it had outdoor seating."
"PA","Great Starbucks shop. The crew knows their stuff. Always good and fast. Become a regular and they will start your drink when you walk in the door without asking."
"PA","Although I normally would suggest a local coffee shop over Starbucks, I like this place. Sure the parking isn't awesome (it's South Side so that's expected), I found this location to be roomie and comfortable. The large table makes it great for groups. I will say, it was freezing inside. Perhaps that's their ""popcorn in a bar"" type of approach to get you to buy more warm drinks? If I am in South Side I would choose Big Dog before this place. But I don't mind this Starbucks if friends want to go. So long as it's not putting Beehive out of business, it's cool by me."
"PA","Nice big Starbucks! Nice enough to hold a meeting or camp out for a work sesh. Typical Starbucks, you know. Wish there was better parking but it's South Side, so you have to expect that. If you're looking for local though make your way over to Big Dog Coffee on Sarah!"
"PA","As far as Starbucks goes, the Southside location is currently my favorite...and I'm not just saying that because it's the most convenient location for me. There are a lot of gripes about parking, but I've rarely had any issue finding a spot when we actually drive there instead of walking. Granted, I mostly go in the middle of the day, though.

The service has always been great! The employees all greet you with a smile, and seem to have a good attitude. Also, don't be afraid of the lines...the service is quick, even when there's only two people behind the counter!

The final compliment I have is the consistency of the drinks. As far as my drinks go, it's one of the few Starbucks that seems to deliver the same quality every time."
"PA","Friendly staff.

Starbucks quality coffee, as expected.

Fast service when busy.

And a rather ample seating area for a southside venue.

I'd ding them for lack of parking ... but ... I never drive there so it doesn't really affect my personal customer experience."
"PA","I dread coming to this Starbucks. Have you ever walked into a place and felt totally uncomfortable? I get that feeling whenever I step into this Starbucks. Unless you walk here, forget finding a parking space. Carson street is very busy, and it's hard to park."
"PA","I enjoy this Starbucks.  Yes, they are caddy-corner to the Beehive, but I need the extra-strong jolt of coffee in the morning that so far only Starbucks can deliver.  

Starbucks in the morning, Behive in the evening!"
"PA","I can't resist the passion tea lemonade, and this location always has the most delicious, moist blueberry coffee cake. But no wireless access unless you're a T-Mobile customer? Lame. Could Starbucks be any more of a corporate whore? Are they that cocky about the quality of their coffee that they think people won't go across the street to the Beehive, or Tuscany, where wireless is free for all to enjoy and the coffee is just as good? Apparently, but  unlike Starbucks, I'm can't be bought that easily."
"PA","I have my business website and email hosted with Pair Networks.

Support is always easy.  There is little to no wait time to speak with a support person.  They have always been very helpful.

Today they did a great job retrieving important emails that I accidentally deleted from my business account.  They went into the backups and found the emails I needed.  They saved the day.  Thank you, Pair Networks!"
"PA","I have been with Pair Networks since 2002 and there is a reason for that, they are great at what they do. 

Correspondence with the Pair team is quick (receive a response typically within 30min to an hour with the support team - sometimes even less) and usually within one email everything I need is addressed entirely. Their staff are also friendly, professional and knowledgeable which is helpful when you have to talk with them (have dealt with other hosting companies and the customer service was lacking). 

Out of the time I have been with Pair, I have only had my website down ""ONCE"" due to server problems in March 2012 (which they helped me with by transferring me to a new server). 

Though the price you pay for hosting is a bit on the pricey side, you sometimes get what you pay for and what I am getting is worth every penny! As long as Pair keeps doing what they are doing, I will be with them for life!"
"PA","I do not give 1 star reviews easily. I've had a site hosted with them for a several years, constantly had to change mail server names to ""fix"" my mail so i could send and receive mail. Today my site went down completely and have been trying for hours to get them to fix it! Unacceptable! Especially when their business site is still up and functioning. Today they have lost my business."
"PA","I was referred to Brunner's by a friend that has been going to them for quite some time, me...I am a completely satisfied customer of well over 10 years.  George is one helluva great guy, his work is top notch and he's always willing to work with you as a customer.  Maggie in the office is fantastic, a breath of fresh air to deal with someone so honest, especially in the automotive repair industry.  I cannot say enough good things about Brunner's, I have referred quite a few friends to them and they are all satisfied customers."
"PA","I live in the neighborhood, so when my clutch went out on my car last October, this was the only place in near proximity that my car could drive to. I had taken my car to Brunner's for the occasional oil change and really liked that they were a local place so I thought it would be ok. 

(mistake #1) I guess I should've known better once I called and asked if they worked on transmissions and the voice on the other end said ""uh, yeah sure, bring it in"". First I paid $250 to change my master cylinder (no pressure for the petal), got it back and could now push the petal but shifting was still off. 

So I took it back (mistake #2) Oh, you need a new clutch. $800. Refusing to cry in front of a stranger, I forked over the dough, and the car - for 2 weeks. Bumming rides to my job that is 30 minutes away, calling after the estimated 4 days, confused as to why it was taking so much longer. Only to receive my car back - clutch not right. I thought that was just how it was going to be from now on, just not so right, but I could drive it and was more afraid of taking it back to the place that considered that as ""fixed"" because I had a feeling that 2 - 3 weeks later, I'd receive my mangled car back, still un-drivable.

Now that my clutch has gone from 'difficult' to 'slipping while I'm driving' again and it's getting a bit dangerous to merge onto the highway, I finally took it to a transmission shop that my regular mechanic suggested. He estimated $450, can have it back to me in a day.

I will NEVER go back. I will hire a tow truck to take my car to my regular mechanic if needed (in Duquesne PA of all places) rather than use them."
"PA","Oh, the search for a trustworthy garage can be a difficult thing. I lucked out and found this place and now it's where I go for my automotive needs. 

I've gone through a few different car inspections with the folks at Brunner's, with two different vehicles, and I've found them to be friendly, accommodating, and affordable."
"PA","We stopped by this last Saturday. My friend came into the city to see me and has never been here. One thing i will say is that I never knew it was so big! I've only been here once, but I honestly did not know how big it is! You know how when you first walk in and there are a few tables opposite of the bar? I thought TIki Lounge ended there! hahahaha. While searching for the bathroom (which wasn't easy!) i noticed the little hideaway spots to sit down at as well as the dance floor in the back... not to mention the downstairs which was another little bar.

I knocked down a star because service wasn't really that good. My personal drink order was fine, but my friend and her bf ordered drinks from a different bartender. Can i just say it's really difficult to get a drink? It wasn't even that busy but the bartenders were busy joking with eachother, replying to texts and dancing around to even notice 4 people patiently waiting to be served. We literally waited 5 minutes and the front bar wasn't that busy. Anywaysssssssss... my friend ordered a drink in one of their cool mugs. The male bartender made her boyfriends drink first (weird) I ended up sitting down to save a table after standing there waiting for her drink. Forever and a day later, she sits down and says ""I have no idea what this is.. but it's not what I ordered and I also asked for a souvenir mug"" While her drink was ok i dont know how they messed up her total drink order.

The atmosphere is fun though and since venturing into the entire ""club(?)"" I think it's totally cool and kind of want to head back. Service is spotty though so I honestly won't come back really often which sucks because the vibe and music is nice."
"PA","Made the mistake of visiting on a Saturday night. Dear lord, it was crowded. Narrow hallways and weird seating arrangements made me very uncomfortable and a tiny open area for dancing was just throbbing with sweaty people bumping around. The bouncers were rude and harsh...the whole experience was just unpleasant."
"PA","I love tiki lounge! I came here on a weekday as I was staying in pittsburgh for a business trip. Came in here after going to the milk shake factory up the block. I just missed the happy hour specials but their drinks are still reasonably priced. They have a great selection of tiki drinks - strong/sweet drinks, along with a reasonable selection of bottled beers. 

The decor of the place is really awesome as its almost cavelike with all the nooks and crannies of all the places you can sit and enjoy your drink. There's a basement downstairs with another bar so it looks like this place probably has music/club nights where I can imagine it gets pretty packed. 

The bathroom has a cute bamboo-water sink device thats pretty cool to check out when you are here.

Otherwise this is a great place for cheap strong drinks and oh yeah theres 2 pinball machines here too :)"
"PA","Said was open at 4. Went to the bar around 415  and wasn't opened. Pretty disappointed."
"PA","This was my Pittsburgh stomping ground. I frequented this place every Saturday my senior year of college. Some things you need to know if visiting Tiki:

As its name implies, this place has a tropic theme which is fun. 

Drink service is quick. They always have tons of bartenders at the ready. There is also a secret little bar on the bottom floor near the bathroom. Only one bartender there, but it's nice if you need a quick round of beers for your friends on the dance floor. 

Bathrooms are on the bottom floor. You have to trek down a flight of stairs. If wearing heels, this is a dangerous journey. Thankfully, they have railings. Three stalls in the ladies bathroom and they never have toilet paper. Stuff napkins in your bra from the bar and you'll be the most popular lady in the bathroom. 

Dance floor is a decent size. Always packed. Super sweaty. Sometimes they will grace you with the Godly wind of a fan. Music is very much top 40 with a few oldies thrown in. It's fine for drunk dancing. 

The demographic is mostly college and it's normally packed with people. You've been warned."
"PA","I was a bit skeptical about this place, but it turned out to greatly exceed my expectations. I don't doubt for a second that the great experience was due to Lucky, our bartender and a bonafide Tiki Evangelist. Not only did he pour some quality classics for us (Mai Tai, Zombie) he riffed on some other classics for some fun original drinks. He got some of my ""beer only""co-workers to not only try, but actually become enthusiastic about tiki drinks. Tiki Lounge was by far the best part of my week long stay in Pittsburgh."
"PA","Went here for a Bachelorette party.

What a fun theme bar!  Amidst the chlorine smell, there were multiple levels of tiki-fied everything!  Tiki waterfalls.  Tiki drink cups.  Tiki lei's.  Tiki chairs.  Tiki walls.  Tiki ceilings.  Tiki, Tiki, Tiki!  

Cheap drinks.  Fun dance floor.  Quiet downstairs.  Fun photo-ops!  It was the perfect place for a big party of people with various interests."
"PA","Come out with a group of friends.. And get the big drink on fire lol get DRUNK and have fun a super BALL!!! Dance hard .. 21 and up"
"PA","i like those 'souvenier' glasses they give you the cocktails in. i feel the need to collect them all. 

and besides... i love any bar/restaurant that is themed."
"PA","I honestly had no idea what we had walked in to. I felt as if we were in Legends of the Hidden Temple and were about to play the blue barracudas for the win. 

It was definitely tropical themed and they even passed out leis at the door. There were fish tanks and water falls, tiki cocktail glasses and rainforest decor. Over all this would have been a fun place to hang out if it weren't for a few problems I had.

First of all, I ordered a cherry bomb and she gave me the gun fake ""red bull"". She didn't tell me they didn't have regular red bull before pouring my drink and it is not good. I decided to drink it anyway because I was in a good mood. Second, the hallway with the bathrooms smelled awful. Almost fishy. Which fits with the theme but is not something I want to smell in a bathroom. They were really cool on the inside with shell sinks and rock walls, but my amazement was ruined by smells of a fish tank. Lastly, the dance floor was WAY too small. We could barely move let alone dance. With all that room in that building, they should really expand that area.

I would give it another chance for the fun idea of it."
"PA","Psssst! Hey you...have you heard about South Seas Thursdays at Tiki Lounge in the Southside yet? No?! Well, let me clue you in to one of the best kept secrets in the Tiki underground of the 'Burgh. 

Lucky the Painproof Man...yes, THAT Lucky, the one who Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museums have determined to the the #1 sideshow act in the world...AND the lovely grass-skirted Greta concoct and create AUTHENTIC tiki drinks made with top shelf rums and many other of only the best-of-the-best liquors, housemade AUTHENTIC falernum, orgeat and other tiki syrups and liqueurs and fresh-squeezed juices. Nope, these aren't the overly sweet, garishly hued cocktails that you used to THINK were tiki, these exotic cocktails are made from the recipes of none other than Trader Vic and Beachbum Berry and from various classic 40's, 50's and 60's tiki bars that created the laid-back, liquid lifestyle that is tiki.

On a recent Thursday my cocktail of choice was Planter's Punch - and yes, it certainly packed one. A punch, that is. I've also enjoyed a Hurricane - nope, not the Hawaiian punch-colored (and, unfortunately, flavored, too) sort, but a REAL Hurricane made with fresh-squeezed juices; a lovely Mai Tai; a Lucky original with coconut, coffee, rums and I'm not sure what else - amazing; a Jet Pilot; Grog...and so, SO many others. 

Whether your choice of poison is a Sufferin' Bastard, a Zombie (enjoyed by many on Halloween, no less!),  Singapore Sling, or a Mai Tai...whether it comes in a tiki mug or a glass adorned with colorful paper umbrellas, cherries, wheels and wedges of citrus, fancy straws or even a tall, spiky pineapple leaf...whether you come with a group or all by your lonesome, you WILL enjoy the cocktails and the company of fellow tiki-philes.  

Making Thursday evenings even more special are the exotic sounds of DJ Dr. Zombo who sets the tiki mood with South Seas sounds and surf rock. Gotta love those marimbas and jungle bird calls! And if you're REALLY fortunate, you might hit on a night when Dr. Zombo breaks out the guitar and joins fellow musicians for surf rock sounds by Vertigo Go!

You can get tiki drinks at the Tiki Lounge any day of the week, but ONLY on Thursdays from 4-9 pm can you get the best of the best of tiki cocktails made by masters. Need a get away? This is it! Sigh...I only wish EVERY night was a South Seas night."
"PA","I wanted to like this place, I really did - especially after seeing a 2' x 2' advertisement for this place in Pittsburgh magazine, upon which after seeing I was hoping to come to some sort of tropical paradise with a volcano, some fire dancers, and maybe some strong pain in the ass drinks. 

Instead, my friend and I narrowly side stepped a huge mess of vomit to get into Tiki Lounge. We were slightly comforted by getting lei'd immediately upon arrival, but we weren't fans of the lounge in general. It's super small, and had to squeeze our way all the way to the back of the bar/lounge - which led to an equally small dance floor which reminded me of a dark room in a smoky frathouse  (wouldn't be surprised if Molly's were being passed around). The whole scene just made my friend and i feel uncomfortable so we took the advice of some other Tiki Lounger's who declared, we're going to Diesel. And so we did, and definitely the best decision of the night."
"PA","Thematically this place really hits the mark but service wise, I don't think you can even expect the bartenders to remember who ordered what drink. The music was offensively awful and the first room you enter is claustrophobically small. As for the prices I'm sure that the volcano cost more than it should of and despite having little tolerance I didn't get much out of it buzz wise. In fact ordering it was a pretty big pain in the ass. We did not really feel comfortable in the area that this bar is located after the sunset."
"PA","I guess I'll start off with the positives about this place...there weren't that many. It has a nice feel to it and the decorations definitely match its name. When I first walked in, I noticed how musty and humid the air was. It was either they tried to replicate the humid beach air...or that's just the result of too many sweaty bodies under one roof. The music was pretty good...mostly mainstream stuff. They have a dance floor, even though it was teeny tiny, but at least there's one. 

            And now let the itching begins...! It was way way way too crowded. I literally had to climb over/ karate chop my way through the crowd. The crowd meant waiting forever to get a drink. The service was awful and the bartenders were so rude. I guess I should be a little more forgiving because I would be cranky too if I had to deal with a drunk crowd all night long. However, they did choose this as a profession so I wish they were a little more enthusiastic about it. My friend ordered a ""zombie"", this light yellow drink that kind of tasted like pina colada. I liked it so I also ordered the same drink, but from a different bartender, since the one that made my friend's drink was busy serving another group. The girl who made my ""zombie"" handed me this pale red drink. It was pretty dark in there, but I could still tell the difference between red and yellow. I was suspicious so told her that my friend ordered the same thing, but it looked a lot different. She rudely replied that maybe the other bartender made it wrong and then walked away. The drink I got tasted straight up like gasoline. I still don't know what a ""zombie"" is supposed to taste like...pina colada or gasoline? 

           It was a terrible first time experience with the drinks, but I thought maybe I was just unlucky that night. The following week, I gave Tiki Lounge another try, hoping maybe my first time there was just an unlucky glitch. My two friends and I all ordered the SAME drink, yes the ""zombie"". However we ordered from 3 different bartenders, and ended up with 3 DIFFERENT drinks at 3 different prices (like 25 cents difference)...all with the same name ""zombie"". So moral of the story...I still don't know what the ""zombie"" is supposed to taste like. I guess they just make whatever the crap they feel like. Be careful when you order the mixed drinks here. Just play it safe and get a beer or something."
"PA","I enjoy the atmosphere and all of the (some would say tacky) decorations & the waterfall! the place has a great vibe as well! I also loved the drink menu. the menu was priced right and they came up with excellent, delicious drink ideas that even i wouldnt of thought of :) for a few bucks more you can get your drink in a take-home souvenir mug! :) overall, we had a great time. i don't think i'll become a regular but ill keep it on my list of cool bars in southside."
"PA","This is the kind of place where someone would just take a dookie on the floor, and you'd be like, ""Whelp! Its the Tiki Lounge!"" and keep dancing

But you're messed up and on the south side, I understand. Its ok. We forgive you.

Try the Lava place instead, much more interesting."
"PA","the tiki lounge itself is pretty awesome, and generally well maintained. the kitsch factor is high, and the fruity drinks are yummy and full of lots of alcohol. although on the expensive side if you purchase with a souvenir mug, why wouldn't you want a rad mug shaped like a parrot or a tiki head or a panda bear? 
  the downside to the tiki lounge is probably the clientele, but I must admit, it makes for great people watching."
"PA","This review is long overdue. And when I say ""overdue,"" I mean that I haven't set foot in Pittsburgh in over five years, let alone have a drink at what was once my favorite bar. But after reading the more recent reviews, it seems that nothing has changed. And that makes me smile.

I remember driving down Carson Street during my college years, always craning my neck around 20th street to get a glimpse of a dark bar set inside a giant Tiki head. ""That's the bar I want to go to on my 21st birthday!"" I always announced. And when I finally got inside, I was ecstatic to find that it was everything I thought it would be.

Over the top tiki decorations. Do they still have that fake rain on the ceiling by the front booths? I always loved the downstairs bar more than the upstairs bar, but I think it was only open on the weekends. Corona was always my drink of choice. That cute waterfall by the stairs, the overcrowded dance floor with more guys than girls, the ""secret"" nook where the skeezy guys would drag their drunken dance partners ... and the bathroom! The bamboo faucet was easily my favorite part of the Tiki Lounge. I looked forward to washing my hands. I dragged my friends inside the bathroom to see it. I wanted (and still kinda want) one for my future home.

I have a lot of memories from this place. Some good, some bad. But surely that is the charm of the Tiki Lounge. The fuzzy cloud of time and nostalgia has probably added a star to my review. But I'm okay with that if you are. I hope the Tiki Lounge never changes."
"PA","Love this place. Hate this place. Lists may be easier... Here goes. 

Loves - strong tiki drinks in cheeseball ceramic glasses you keep, corny atmosphere, decent prices. 

Loathes - mega smoky environment (even the door guy was standing inside and smoking), weekend crowd with iq around 65, music played was far from tropic themed. 

I realized the trick was to visit earlier in the evening to have a better time."
"PA","I haven't gone on a weekday... but OMG!! going there on a Saturday was AWFUL!! I was there for 15 mins tops. You are shoulder to shoulder with strangers, you have to fight to get in or out of the door. They have one bar, with one bartender. So there is no way you are going to get a drink. I didn't use the bathrooms, but my friend said they were covered in crap. It was a gross experience. PERIOD."
"PA","So, so over the top that you can't help but love it. But there are two distinctly different experiences that you can have here.

Tiki Lounge during the week: 4 stars. Super chill, friendly bartenders, decent specials. Usually some sort of rock or metal music playing. The best way to describe the crowd is 30-something and 40-something dudes with tattoos and leather jackets. And the occassional stumbling girl on her 21st birthday who is all, ""I'M SOOOO EXCITED TO FINALLY GO TO TIKI LOUNGE, GUYS!"" and orders the giant punchbowl with 6 umbrella straws and plastic monkeys floating in it and leaves as soon as she finishes it because, ""I JUST WANNA DANCE!"" (no judgments, we've all been there). So I probably won't meet my future husband at Tiki Lounge, but it's definitely a solid place to have a couple beers (or throwback tropical cocktails in tacky souvenir cups...yes, for real) and catch up with friends.

Tiki Lounge on the weekend: 1 star...sad face. On the weekends, Tiki transforms into a douchebag mecca. Top 40 jams are blaring from the speakers but it's packed so tight with bros and hos that you can't even try to dance to them, and good luck getting a drink. To be fair, sometimes I feel that Tiki is a little bit like Gretchen Weiners in Mean Girls...they can't help it that they're so popular. And you know, if you like the typical Southside experience, do it up! Personally, I'll steer clear until Monday rolls back around.

Other Awesome Things:
-Bingo on Tuesdays
-Waterfall

Update: As I am leaving the Steel City, I decided to visit Tiki Lounge one last time to finally take home some of those crazy cups. I chose two ceramic pandas with straw holes. It might not be your typical Pittsburgh souvenir, but for me, it's the perfect way to remember my 3 years spent here. Tiki Lounge...I'll be back!"
"PA","Came to Tiki Lounge to meet up with some peeps around 9ish. The decor fits the theme yet it has a slit grimy feel once inside. No cover and the place wasn't crowded yet that we could hear each other talk in the front. Drinks were cheap. I was led to the bathroom and was amazed at how big the venue was - a back and then a downstairs with water flowing along the sides. Kind of dreamy in a hazy mindset. Music was better in the front than in the back though not sure if that is dj dependent. And then Tiki Lounge got super busy once it hit 11ish. Wall to wall with people that if we did not have our table it would be super uncomfortable. Then to top it off one of the bartenders was incredibly rude and kept rolling her eyes whenever we would ask for some drinks or when we went to go close our tab. She wouldn't give me my tab to sign or really acknowledge me until my other friend signed hers. I don't get it! The other bartenders were friendly which goes a long way. I could see myself coming back to Tiki for a few drinks in the early night but because of how this bartender had treated us I'm not sure I would want to. Booo!"
"PA","I hate that I'm giving this place only 1 star, b/c I do like this place at times, but a horrible bartender just ruined it for me.  I went there recently with a big group of friends.  You would think we'd be a bartender's dream come true, b/c we are a pretty chill crowd and totally get how hard the service industry can be.

Well this female bartender was not doing herself any favors by consistently giving us the wrong drinks.  My friend had been drinking Corona Light so she ordered another one (I should mention we did have a bartender change - the initial one had his shit together) with this woman.  The woman just opens a Corona (regular) and doesn't say anything.  So my friend is like, oh I ordered a Corona LIGHT.  And then this bartender is like well we don't have Corona LIGHT.

At this point my friend was like I was just drinking a Corona LIGHT, after a heavy sigh the waitress went over and brought my friend a Corona Light.  What the heck was that all about?!?!  

Ok weird, but we can get over it.  The same thing happened to my friend's husband not 15 minutes later!!!  Now, we're just questioning her bar-tending skills and it's not like she was apologetic in either instance.  There was just a lot of sighing and eye rolling on her part - apparently she never got the memo that bar-tending is about customer service.  And even if you feel that way, it's probably not in your best interest to be huffing and puffing and rolling your eyes around like you're having a seizure in front of the customer.

So here's the icing on the cake and which directly effected the star rating for me.  I went to close my tab along with 2 of my friends (who also had to close their tabs) and I will admit that I have an intimidating last name, although if you spent time looking at it, you'd realize that it's quite easy if you phonetically pronounce it.  

But not the point - I tell her my last name and my friends give her their last name.  She brings over 2 of the 3 tabs and is like ok I have one for a ""Serena, Last name I can't even pronounce!"" and then calls the names of my other friends.  Ummm...wouldn't it have been sufficient to say ""Serena"" - it wasn't like there were 5 ""Serena's"" waiting to close their tab.  And perhaps this was just a minor event, but coupled with the other aspects of the night with her - I just couldn't even take it.  She was so horrible as a bartender and just ignorant as a person!

I just hope if I go there again, she won't be the bartender that night!  If she is, you can bet that I'll be leaving pronto."
"PA","I have never been to a bar quite like this place! I really liked the cheesy decorations! I loved how there are so many places you can hang out and that there is an option for you to dance or relax at a booth or the bar with friends. It can get a little crowded but what's fun about being in an empty bar? I really liked the downstairs bar in the basement. But the poor bartender was all by herself down there so it took a while to get drinks.
I will definitely be going back!"
"PA","I kind of have a thing for Tiki Lounges (if you do too, and are in SF, you have to check out Tonga Room in the Fairmount Hotel). 

Anyway, Tiki Lounge really does cater directly to that craving. You can tell from the entrance alone that they have really incorporated all things Tiki into the design and layout of the bar, even on the way to the loo. Unfortunately, the virtues of the Tiki Lounge don't go much farther. There's an awesome happy hour with free pinball. The beer selection and drinks are good, and the staff are nice, but you get the feeling that this place was awesome in the 80's and somehow fell by the wayside. 

I think with a little renovation it could be an amazing bar. Or if they did indoor mini-golf tournaments on Saturday afternoons."
"PA","Don't show up here sober.  The decor is taken very seriously with waterfalls that make the whole downstairs smell like The Log Jammer at Kennywood.  There are good drink specials, even on weekend nights, if you aren't particular about what kind of liquor is used.  The music is generally Top 40 and the dance floor is full of wannabe Jersey Shore extras by midnight.  If you're looking for a place on Carson Street for drunken debauchery, this is your jam."
"PA","Love some Tiki Lounge.
Drink specials? A waterfall?
Jungle black out time."
"PA","If you're a fan of tiki culture, this place is a must visit. You can tell it was a labor of love to design. If you're just a regular pittsburgh yinzer bar hopper, you might not ""get"" it and think the decorating was cheesy or take this place for granted. 

For a tiki fan, your best bet to beat the Yinzer beer/shot crowd is sometime during the week the earlier in the evening the better. Mixed drinks were good and strong. 

Going to start a local TIKI meetup here for Pittsburgh area tikiphiles. See details over at tikicentral.com forums."
"PA","Fun blast from the past with my first Singapore Sling in many, many years!  Hit this place early in the day so I have no idea what the primetime scene is like.  But I can say it was a comfortable place sit at the bar, talk music with the bartender and while away an hour."
"PA","Cheesy island decor. Loud top 40. Lots of people. Good for the just turned 21 crowd."
"PA","Cheesy interior, crowded, average music selection in the back dance floor.

Despite all that, Tiki Lounge can be fun if you're in the right frame of mind. It's a long narrow club with the obvious 'tiki' theming. But just get inside, have a few drinks at the basement bar (avoid the first level as it's always too overcrowded), hit the dance floor, pray they don't play too much Lady GaGa.

The female bartender in the basement bar knows her stuff; the guy, not so much. It's a bit of a college/hot mess type of crowd but hey, sometimes we all need a little dirrty in our lives."
"PA","I'll admit, I had my misgivings about this place... At first glance, the only word that came to mind was: CHEESY.

I walked in to see a casual Hawaiian bar theme going on... became confused when I took a few more steps and realized there was a dancing room in the back... I took the stairs down and re-entered yet another room with a Tiki bar setup. 

At first, I was thinking, ""this is just weird."" After a few more drinks, however, I kinda liked that there were different themes going on in different parts of the bar... Not to mention, my gfs and I made some new friends that night. (That always helps!) 

Honestly, I went in with little to no expectations and so, I was bound to win that night. (Or I'm glad that I did anyway.) But fyi, this is definitely not a ""lounge"". It's more of a bar than anything else.

OHHHH, and did I mention? $5.50 for a jager bomb?! That's insanely cheap. Definitely a nice change from the $15-20 jager bombs in NYC and DC!"
"PA","Worst bar ever! I came with a group, and after my girlfriend ordered two sets of drinks for the group two low lifes (the employees) approached her and told her she was ordering too much and had to leave. They lost all of our business. Honestly the rudest thing I've ever witnessed."
"PA","I kinda felt like I was on the set of Legends of the Hidden Temple at this bar. Almec might have been the bouncer. I was only here for an hour so I might not have gotten the full experience and I wasn't drinking. 

This bar had a lot of ""nooks and crannies""  and drunk twosome were certainly aware of this. 

Pro: Funny Female Bartender in the basement (Some wasted guy was hitting on her and she was just making fun of him), Visually stimulating, Random Music, Multiple bars 

Cons: Smoking, smelled a bit like a water park, security was creepy (that's weird,right?)

I will go back for the complete experience."
"PA","i typically hate bars like this, but there's something about tiki that i just can't hate on.

theme bars walk a fine-line, but this place goes balls out, and it ends up working for them. i mean there's a god damn waterfall in the back.

don't get too drunk or you may think you've wandered onto the most insane mini-golf course of your life."
"PA","The atmosphere here is really neat.  The drinks are bit pricey.  It gets really busy on the weekends, we tend to hit it up on thursday nights (thursdays the new friday, right?).  I can honestly say, besides the fact that they blast the music at a level so high you can't even have a conversation with the bartender about your order, this place is relatively tolerable."
"PA","Every time I'm in town I stop by this place since I went to school with some of the guys who tend bar here. While the place isn't the greatest, mostly due to the fact that it's about twenty feet from wall to wall at its widest point, I'll give it an above-average (for me) three stars for originality and spunk. While Tiki bars may be prevalent in Pacific island tourist traps, you don't see too many dahntahn.

Side note: make sure you card the senoritas here to avoid statutory rape charges. Check for ID forgeries. =)"
"PA","this place is, guess what, decorated like a Tiki Lounge. and they did not skimp on the decor, for real.  they have a shitload of giant cocktails you are meant to sip from a hollowed out coconut.  not surprisingly, i stuck with beer.  can't remember what the music was like.  not a bad place, was pretty empty the time i went."
"PA","Bamboo, palm trees, pictures of Elvis Presley: the decor is appropriately not subtle.  This makes it a great place for a guy to order a ""girlie drink"" and not stick out so much."
"PA","This was one of the first bars my boyfriend and I visited when looking for apartments in Pittsburgh (from NY) we had SO much fun and the music was awesome. It was like being in a tiki hut. Atmosphere was lots of fun. This is one of our favorite spots and I made sure to make a stop on my birthday. This is a MUsT when on East Carson"
"PA","I've only bought a few items here but this is the place to get the very best equipment at. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. The bicycle line up is top-notch and if they don't have what your looking for, your looking for the wrong thing."
"PA","Thicks is a very nice bicycle shop I bought my first fat bike there and it is wonderful the  people are awesome and they are all very patient with you. I bought a mukluk salsa there and haven't regretted it yet. Met some cool people there. No matter what kind of ridder u are they will help u. Lot and lots of products kept in stock. And to the sales lady that help me you're wonderful and thank you again."
"PA","My folding bike had a problem during a ride on a stop in Pittsburgh, and this was the closest shop. I got lucky because these guys were the best. Super friendly, knowledgable and they fixed my bike while I waited. Best bike shop I've been to, hands down. They had tons of bikes in stock too. I would've bought one from them if I could've."
"PA","The people at Thick's are incredibly friendly and generous. Within less than 10 minutes they adjusted the handle bars on my bike and helped me readjust my suv bike rack so that it was on correctly. I was fully expecting to pay but he didn't charge me at all. He just offered his help and told us me come back if I needed anything else. I plan to return to buy some accessories. But in the meantime, I highly recommend this shop. Shop local people!!!!"
"PA","Terrific bike shop in a terrific Southside location. I recently bought an amazing roadbike from them for a very good price. Had a minor problem with a tire, took it back to them, and they fixed it while I waited. Staff is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Their website says it all, ""Bike people doing bike stuff."" I live in another part of town, but will continue to come back to Thick."
"PA","I recently bought a bike from them.  They did a great job.  At that point, I was using an old department store Schwinn from when I was only a teenager.

The sales lady helped me out.  She went through my options and helped find a bike that fit me well.  She also indicated which accessories are useful versus a waste of money.

I do understand locks and security.  I like that Thick is explicit regarding why they don't carry cable locks.  It indicates to me that Thick is trying to help the customer and not waste our time."
"PA","Went in there on Thursday, planning to simply ask some questions, get some ideas. I was pretty sure I wanted a hybrid but, overwhelmed by the vast amount of information I was seeing when doing internet research, I decided to just go talk to experts. A friend of mine pointed me to Thick Bikes and I'm glad he did. For over 2 hours, Chris helped me with showing me bikes, answering super noobish questions, letting me test drive various models, and providing zero pressure sales help. That last point was greatly appreciated because, especially when faced with an expensive purchase, the last thing I would want would be to be pressured into the wrong thing. Chris genuinely cared that I was happy with what I got, didn't try to forcefully upsell me on extras, and left me with such a positive attitude towards them that I will never go elsewhere for my bicycle needs. If you want a chill place, with super nice and knowledgeable staff, and a great selection, I don't know why you would ever consider going anywhere else."
"PA","Great local bike shop! Adam, wow, what can your really say about him? Dedicated, knowledgable, patient, funny... Hey Adam:Don't forget to eat lunch!

I bought a redline conquest there a few months ago and I love it! I wasn't sure at first but Chris looked at it against the other option I chose and said, ""no question take the redline!""

Their range services and merchandise are good too. If you haven't been there, stop by and if you aren't already, get cycling!"
"PA","I've been in a bunch of bike stores over the years and I've found that you can usually get ""knowledgeable"" or  you can get ""nice"" but if you get one, don't expect the other.  I'm not the sort of stereotypical bicyclist people think about; I own no lycra, I'm kinda fat, and I'm not terribly concerned with speed.  If anybody on this planet looks like they don't belong in a bike shop, it's probably me.  To add to this, I'm also a giant pain in the ass as I'm nearly 6'3 but have a 29"" inseam:  You don't want to deal with me when I come in to get fitted for a new bike.  It's going to be complicated.  Knowing this, I usually dread going into a bike store that I've never been to for the first time.  Thick pretty much put all of this unease to rest within a minute of my walking through their door when I decided to buy my latest bicycle.

The staff at Thick have been great through everything:  from my initial inquiries, to fitting my bike and the subsequent supporting me through thousands of miles of crashes and other emergencies.  I've never felt pressured into buying anything, and I think I've gotten pretty honest direction whenever I've asked about products I wasn't too knowledgable about.

It's also worth noting that I tend to ask a bunch of stupid questions and they have consistently dealt with all of them in a friendly and productive manner.  If you're looking for a store you can go for and buy a bike and not worry about being judged by bike nerds, this is the best store in the area without any question.  Thick Bikes is the rare intersection of ""knowledgable"" and ""nice"" that I mentioned above.  They're all really nice people and they know their stuff.  

 I have not regretted a single dollar I have spent here.  This is how a company should be run, and as such I will drive across the city to spend six bucks on an innertube just to make sure Thick gets the sale."
"PA","I had a last minute disaster with my pannier rack the day before setting off on a ride from Pittsburgh to Washington DC. Thick Bikes were amazing. They squeezed me into their schedule at the end of the day to do a custom job fitting a new rack to my road bike. They're passionate about biking, knowledgable and good fun to chat with. Cheers!"
"PA","This place has excellent service. In my recent hunt for a commuter hybrid, my first stop was Thick Bikes. A friend had recommended it, and boy was he right! I went in not really sure of what I was looking for, but Chris helped me figure out what I wanted and showed me several different bikes. They didn't have anything used that was fixed up and would meet my needs properly, but I did test ride five or six new bikes over the course of about an hour, and Chris was helping me out the entire time. I did not end up purchasing here, but this is a great little place that you should definitely consider if you are in the market for a bike!"
"PA","I have pruchased four bikes from Thick over the years.  The owner really defines this bike shop. This is not a saran wrap jersey weekend warrior kind of rider place as best I can tell though they do have several bikes or that kind of rider.  They sell a lot of bikes for people who use their bikes for transportation.  

Their bike selection is very good and the bikes are generally not the gazillion dollar carbon bikes you see in store windows.  

I also have had my bikes serviced here and never had an issue.

I can't recommend Thick highly enough if you are looking for a bike in Pittsburgh."
"PA","I've purchased two different all-city brand bikes from the shop new, and taken a few other bikes in for service and always been totally satisfied with the quality of work that they have done. 

Thick bikes carries a lot of products geared towards commuters and is less aimed towards high end road stuff. You'll see a lot of steel bikes, some aluminum frames, and not much carbon fiber. Most of the people in the shop ride mountain bikes, so they also tend to have a good amount of mountain bike and cyclocross gear as well.  I do a lot of bike maintinance myself, and when I go there for parts and other gear, they usually have what I need in stock, which is a huge plus for me.

They have a stock of refurbished used bikes at really reasonable prices in their basement which you might not notice when you head in to the shop.  It's a really good alternative to buying a used bike elsewhere since you know it's already been looked over and tuned up by a reputable shop."
"PA","I go here for all of my bicycle needs. They are the most knowledgable and friendly people to deal with. I bought my SE from them and they got it ready within a week. Considering how busy they were at the time (BIKE WEEK!), that's pretty decent. 
Today I combination locked my bike outside their shop, went to work, and called them when they opened to see if they could look at my rim and fix it. Adam, took my bike back to the mechanic and within five minutes they called me back with my options. 
Good folks."
"PA","Love this place. 
Great staff. 
Adam helped me out a ton. 
Get your next bike here or get your old one services here."
"PA","I was initially impressed with the shop and the unusual selection of accessories available but I think the prices are rather high. I got a reasonable deal on a new bike but wanted to followup with the shop with some questions I had. Turns out the place seems to either be staffed by the owner, Chris, or one other person; multiple emails to the owner went unanswered and, when I went to the shop, Chris wasn't there and the person available couldn't help me. 

To be fair, I've heard very positive things about this shop from others but I just wasn't feeling the love of the store. I think there are cleaner, friendlier and certainly warmer (and I mean temperature wise) places to shop that have a better selection of stuff available in a nicer environment."
"PA","Hands-down the most vile customer service I have ever witnessed. I accompanied a friend into this establishment. He wanted to buy some wheels. He was, instead, promptly encouraged to buy a new bicycle. The salesperson then listed a number of incorrect reasons why a new bicycle would cost less than a wheelset. When my friend politely turned-down the suggestion, the salesperson then encouraged him to buy a bargain wheelset that he described as ""pretty good."" He was, however, unable to  tell us anything notable about the features of the wheel without googling it. It was a very poorly-made wheelset. I have worked in bike shops. I have managed bike shops. I know that contrary to what salesman may say, ""unsealed"" bearings have no practical advantages over ""sealed"" bearings (which I would like to point out are nonspecific terms). As much as I try to support local small businesses, I would rather buy a bicycle at Wal Mart than give one cent to these clowns."
"PA","This place is half-hidden within a group of rowhousing, behind Pizza Sola. Hard to find, but hard to not find what you need there!

They have full bikes, used bikes, parts, accessories, and friendly service. Need repair or advice? These guys know what's up, down, left and right (and wrong) with any bike issue you may have."
"PA","I went to Thick Bikes today to get a simple bike to ride to work.  I was worried about going in because bike stores can be intimidating if you're not _really_ into bikes.

I drove up and there was ample parking in the lot in front of the shop (Score!  How often does that happen on the south side?)  I stepped out of my car and was greeted by Dan (I think that was his name) who was friendly and helpful and not even a little condescending.  He knew what I needed and recommended a very reasonably priced bike.  He helped me pick out a rack for the back of the bike and assured me I could install it myself (though the shop would do it for $8).  All in all I was very happy with the service, and the bike seems great (though I haven't taken it on a serious ride yet).

They also appeared to have some higher end bikes, road bikes and lots and lots of accessories and parts.  Also, the owner of the shop (who is a transplant from Brooklyn) does custom work etc.

Welcome to Pittsburgh, Thick Bikes!"
"PA","Bottom line: these guys are nice, friendly, and know their stuff.

I have been playing guitar for quite a few years, and have a few (Martin, a couple Fenders, etc.) and have gotten to the point where I now have kids who are interested in playing. My daughter (11) had saved up around $100 from a combination of birthdays, Christmas and busking (fiddle), and wanted to buy a mandolin. We made several browsing trips to Pittsburgh Guitars before stopping by one day when there were two mandolins that she really liked. (though there were a few more that were out of the price range!) Besides our other trips from before, on that trip, the two guys working spent about an hour and a half with us, showing her how to tune, playing it for her so she could hear it, answering all her questions, and just being generally nice and conversational.  

Even though we weren't spending that much, they took a lot of time to help us out and were super considerate and friendly. All their instruments, even the more ""budget"" ones, were set up by an instrument tech, and had new strings on them. They were so excited about her interest in music and very complimentary about a kid wanting to play mandolin in general, it just made the whole event really special for her."
"PA","Really great little shop. Good selection of used guitars and enough new so you can get a feel for what you want. What is obvious is these guys love music, love guitars and want to share that passion. There is no ""guitar shop snobbery"" here. If you want a $250 guitar, they are just as likely to put a $175 instrument in your hand as a $300; they honestly try & help you find the guitar for you."
"PA","These guys are wonderful.  Seriously.  It's a Mom and Pop kind of place.  Since I was in teens these guys have been giving me advice on guitars and amps.  

They're friendly extremely knowledgeable and patient.  

Great Selection of Vintage and New guitars, bass guitars, and amps.  

plus the tech their works wonders.  He's patient and friendly.  they're helped me with a lot of technical problems through the years.

Thanks!!"
"PA","If you want to hear some real Pittsburgh accents, this is ground zero. It's one of the most local joints I've been in, and I love it. The dogs are among the longest, but I might even prefer them plain to Pittsburgher with cheddar and olives on it. They use Smith hot dogs, which have some pork in there, the owner says it prevents them from shriveling up. I don't subscribe to kosher, so bring it maximum. Watch them grill it behind the counter and speak up to add on loaded fries - I wish I did. 

Check out the other reviews: 5 stars, 5 stars, 4 stars, 2 stars and 1 star. That's some polarizing shit. And the 2 star is from a vegetarian, cat lady - Keep it! That's how I know Pickle Barrel is for me."
"PA","I had a veggie hoagie and cheese fries. The fries were thin and went straight from the bag to the fryer, the cheese 'sauce' was cheese powder mixed with too much water and my hoagie was a bunch of fried veggies (even the lettuce) poured over a burnt bun. They also made the mistake of putting canned mushrooms in the mix. I loathe canned mushrooms! Blah, yuck, gross! 

I'm giving this place 2 stars as a vegetarian,  perhaps if I ate meat The Pickle Barrel would score higher. It is dirt cheap and if they had veggie alternatives I would definitely return."
"PA","My experience here was weird as shit.

I came to the Pickle Barrel with two friends one morning a couple of months ago. We sat down, ordered coffee and drinks, and then waited. Forever. I'm not kidding. My friend's diet coke eventually made its way into the picture at some undefined point in time, but all three of our waters and the coffee just never came. There were maybe 4 other customers and definitely 3 employees working the entire time we were there. We all ordered something off the menu and NOT ONE OF US got what we ordered. And while we ate what we didn't order...we still didn't have drinks after politely reminding the staff twice. How the hell is this place still in business? 

I do have to say that the staff atleast knew what poor service was going on and took several items off of our bill. I think I ended up paying 89 cents or some really weird amount. The experience was almost like being drunk in a completely sober state as I left the place thinking to myself, ""Did that just happen? Is this real life?""

What a ""pickel"" that situation was."
"PA","If you're broke, love tasty burgers and live in Da Burgh or just visiting.... THIS IS YOUR PLACE! I love this place... CHEAPEST BURGERS IN TOWN! The only down side is... it's not 24 hour! I now live back in California and a tear comes to my eye every time a thought passes through my mind of my dear Pickle Barrel... tasty morsels.... out as fast as they went in. WE WILL REUNTIE THIS SOON!"
"PA","Great greasy spoon breakfast!  If you're craving a cheap hotdog or burger with all the fixins, look no further.  I enjoy the food here, and it's super cheap.  You can't really go wrong.  I'm not a fan of the chilli fries.. but that's just me"
"PA","One day for some reason I was craving a hot dog with sauerkraut, like the ones at the Brighton Hot Dog Shoppes in Beaver County. Where on earth could I find such a thing on the south side? Only at the Pickle Barrel. 

They have all sorts of toppings for their burgers and footlong hot dogs, and they also make a big deal about their fries, which can be loaded with chili, bacon, cheese, or onions. It's standard greasy spoon kinda stuff, but pretty cheap and in a friendly (though not air conditioned) environment.

I see a lot of the south side old timers here for breakfast too."
"PA","This gas station could use a major face lift. It's looks exactly how I remember it looked almost 15 years ago.  The entire the store is cramped but it's place to buy cigarette."
"PA","This was a frightening experience. I never would have pulled in but I needed gas and the BP across the steel which was my intended destination was completely out of order. This stations pumps are so old you have to flick the little lever up to turn them on. On top of this there are only 4 of them which makes navigating around hard. To top it all off the card reader wouldnt take my card. No big deal. I go inside and pay. I'm told to go outside and hit the pay inside button and that the worker would let me pump it up. I go to do so and can't get the button to work. A worker comes out to try, then he hits it and another button simultaneously then he bangs on it a few times and finally makes me go to another pump (remember how close together these 4 pumps are...). Will never return here."
"PA","This bar used to be really popular with the tatted up, pierced set. Good times. The crowd was mainly regulars, the drinks were cheap. This was my home away from home for a while. Then the bartenders started to ban people left and right. Then people got barred for stating out loud that they were going to the bar next door to hang out with their barred friends. Or for stating that they were going to catch a band next door. Or for, you know, breathing wrong. It got so bad Slacker started selling Barred from Dee's tee shirts, but the owner of Dee's put a stop to that. The guy clearly has no sense of humor. Or any sense as to how to run a successful business. 

I haven't been back in years and don't plan to. Yeah it's got a cool layout and the younger bartender who worked upstairs was an absolute peach, but in general this place left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a fear of being barred for no reason. The Smiling Moose a few doors down welcomed the mass exodus from this place with open arms and while I no longer drink on the South Side, I will always be grateful that my friends and I, barred from Dee's Cafe or not, still had someplace fun to drink."
"PA","Awesome spot to chill with friends. Not the busiest of bars, at least when ive been there. Pool tables and darts offered.  The selection of music you hear is very wide range."
"PA","Cash only. No frills. No fuss. Cheap beer and beer specials during games. Smoking is a must. The bartenders are friendly. They highly recommended the pudding and Jell-O shots.  My party was skeptical, but the ladies behind the bar tell no lies. The banana pudding shot nearly brought me to tears. Far from pretentious. Clean but smoky. You may have to contend with death metal playing on the juke box. Always a good time."
"PA","Cheap drinks, pool, cheap drinks, rad people, cheap drinks, and a ""could give a shit"" vibe that I live in a good dive.  Don't be an asshole and you can basically do what you want here.  My kinda place."
"PA","I use to hang out here quite a bit back in the nineties But now I find the average age is about 22 or 23. Despite the prior reviewers mentioning it being open-minded and whatever,   Dees can be very very cliquey and i-just-escaped-from-the-wealthy-suburbs kind of bratty .  We used to joke about all the ""trust-a-farians"" that were here on any given night.  An extreme amount of cigarette smoke in the air. Disgusting. The policy of not accepting credit or debit cards is extremely backwards. The bartenders are legendary for banning people for the slightest offense.  A Penguin hockey player or 2 used to come in here back in the day. Not sure about now ."
"PA","Pretty spacious. Mixed crowd. One of the better bars on carson IMO"
"PA","Its a dive bar, through and through. Lots of pool tables, a dingy atmosphere, a colorful variety of patrons and cheap, strong drinks. 

Its nothing out of the ordinary, it doesn't have a lot that makes it stand out from other bars - but its a solid night out if you are just looking for a few kicked back games of pool and some drinks."
"PA","The lighting is TERRIBLE.  For a dive bar, it's lit too well.  The drinks are cheap.  The bartenders are grumpy.  Just the way I love it.  This place is always a staple in any Pittsburghers life.  You go through a phase of hating and then loving.  My biggest gripe, it's in the southside and the lighting sucks"
"PA","dee's is a nice little gem that I've recently been introduced to. 

it's a typical dive. a big back room with three pool tables and a cut out in the wall so you can order drinks without having to go back to the front room. it gets really packed on weekends but full of familiar faces. you can smoke in here so it gets smokey by the end of the night but good for us people who can't control our cigarette consumption when intoxicated. also a glass of pbr is only $1.25 and a mixed (very strongly mind you) drink with well liqour is only $3!!! 

downside: the service sucks. they're really rude. I understand someone who's worked there for years develops an attitude of ""don't give a damn"" but it was a little startling. it's your job, get over it. 

but since a bar's prices, atmosphere, & crowd are more important because my interaction with the service is so minimal, it's all worth it."
"PA","It seems that everyone I know in Pittsburgh has had their Dee's phase. You have to love a place that has mixed drinks that are stiff and cheap. For 10 bucks you can get pretty messed up.

The crowd is an ideal mix of open-minded hipsters, punks, outcasts and nerds. It can feel a bit cliquey because everyone knows everyone, but people are actually really friendly. You can pretty much start a conversation with any random stranger. It's one of the few places on the south side where you can get away from the college meathead crowd.

The ping pong table upstairs is great and so is the jukebox. Sometimes I try to mess with people by playing something like Bell Biv DeVoe. But nobody ever minds. That's what I love most about Dee's - the complete lack of pretension."
"PA","Awesome place.

Ping pong and Pool and drinks all at reasonable prices.

good people, good times.

I would give it 5 stars but for the internet jukebox..."
"PA","A favorite place for me and my crew. We're fans of getting drunk and playing games, so the selection between darts, pool and ping-pong (available at the upstairs bar, which I believe is open 9-2 thurs to sat) is definitely a plus.

Yuengling bombers, a pretty sweet juke box and smoking inside. These things are all good. Definitely a divey sort of bar, but that's my style and I love it. Always a good array of people to watch when you arrive. Lots of characters for sure. And that's one of the things that makes Dee's so great! Cheapest drinks on E Carson doesn't hurt either. 

Say hello if you spot me! It's always a stop any time we're in the area."
"PA","Everytime we get into Pittsburgh late at night - this is our first stop.  I love this bar, I can't wait to be back next week!"
"PA","One of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh.  I have gone there pretty steadily for the past 8 years.  You can always count on a good drink at a good price compared to other bars on the South Side.  It is a bit of a dive but that gives it great character.  And, I love Dee's juke box.  I could probably put $20 in there and listen to good music all night long.  There's usually a good mix of people there.  I can enjoy a whole night at Dee's if I can score a booth.  And I always see people I know there."
"PA","an oasis in the fratastic stretch known as carson street. while there are other legit (and respectable) bars on the southside, dee's has always been my favorite.

the drinks are cheap and the interior dingy but comfortable. i hang out here and pretend to miss my friends calls to meet them at town tavern.

i can easily say this is the one bar i miss since moving to new york."
"PA","A regular hangout during my graduate school years, Dee's was always a mixture of folk, from the college crowd to punk rockers, metal heads to the local pubbies. Often a place we were seen post dinner, pre-Bar 11 (which isn't in the Yelp listings, but worth finding if it's still there) and were many billiards were shot, shots taken and songs chosen from a jukebox. Beer = cheap, Southside = fun. Try it."
"PA","Meh. Pizza was ok. Nothing to write home about.

Honestly, if it hadn't been 11:30pm on New Years Eve, the service would have really gotten to me. Don't get me wrong, I was still pissed. But I am a reasonable human and realized that it was not an awesome night for these poor girls serving endless drunk assholes. We ordered two pizzas, they only made one. They told us the second would just take 5 minutes, it took 20. All in all the pizza wasn't worth the frustrations."
"PA","Decent go to pizza place for our work team"
"PA","Eh.. The food was just ""eh"". Let's start off by saying the ""Phone girl"" was extremely rude, therefore I was given a bad impression right off the bat. The wings tasted.. Or rather didn't taste like anything at all but were sitting in a pile of grease.. Appetizing right? Pizza was sub par.. First and last time for sure."
"PA","Great food, and amazing customer service. I order for delivery all the time and it always comes on time and fast. No matter of the weather. The drivers are also very friendly. I highly suggest that everyone would order from here, they are the best in pittsburgh. Even if you have dine in, it is very cozy and very friendly surrounding. You can not find any place better than Gennaros pizza. And they serve alcohol!!!!"
"PA","Mediocre at best.  See that delicious looking picture up there that shows you how great the chicken tenders are?  Well that's exactly what I ordered, except for mine, they came fried a little extra.  I might be being kind with that.  The were fried extra to the point where each bite tasted of burnt coating.  No matter what I dipped them in I still tasted the burnt-ness.

Next time I order from here, I'll make sure to order something that doesn't come from the fryer."
"PA","Gennaros become my favorite pizza shop in south side. It's really good place to stop and get hot pizza. I think they start to serve beer like couple weeks ago... Not the best waitress service but they have good food that can be delivered right to your door!!!!"
"PA","I like Gennaros. Standard pizza hole in the wall kind of place. They're never busy and the staff is always grumpy but the pizza taste good so I keep going back. Prices are middle of the road and the same as pizza Sola and sals. If your looking for a local pizza place that serves decent food go here."
"PA","Good food, been in point since it was little Chicago's. Deep dish pizza is awesome. Service was ok. But here's my gripe. Who wants to sit down to eat in an UN aircondioned restaurant, with 7 oz plastic cups, and plastic forks and knives. Who serves a 3 inch thick pizza un cut, and expects you to cut it with plastic ware. Just because you do a lot of late  night business with drunk people doesn't mean you should neglect the day time dining crowd. We do care about how we eat our food, not just shoving it down our throats to help get us a dui checkpoint."
"PA","Long time customer... 3/22/14 officially no longer a customer. They charge you for an XL pizza, ""16 slices"" and give you a LARGE pizza in a smaller box. Took a long time but now a SELL OUT pizza shop. Hope the rest of the Southside Community stays away from Gennaros. Sad day for a pizza lover."
"PA","Have downsized their pizzas, though not their prices. I have been ordering regularly from them, but now I need to find a new place, because this last experience was not good. They did make their ""Medium"" into what used to be ""Small"" - so less for the the same price. And when it arrived, it was extremely thin on toppings. Still tasted fine, but clearly a move is on to reduce the value that you get from them."
"PA","We used to order about six pizzas a month from this place, but are now done with Gennaro's. Last night, we ordered two LARGE (16""/12-cut) one-topping pizzas, but when the pizzas arrived, they were MEDIUM/14"" size, with one cut into 10 slices and the other in eight. We checked the receipt to confirmed we were charged for LARGE pizzas and then called to let them know that they sent two mediums. The unapologetic response we got was that they've recently changed sizes and MEDIUM is the new LARGE. (You'd think they might have mentioned that to a regular customer?) So we ended up with the equivalent of 16 slices when we ordered 24. 

Either somebody screwed up and they lied instead of fixing the problem OR they really are now charging large prices for medium pizzas. So I called the following day and asked to speak to the owner. The man who answered the phone said the owner wasn't available, but identified himself as the manager and confirmed the story. I pointed out to him that the menu on their website still shows that a large pizza is 16""/12-cut and he told me the website hadn't been updated yet.

There are lots of places to order pizza from on the South Side and I'm sure I can find another that's more worthy of my business than Gennaro's."
"PA","Don't order from this place! SCAM they gave me the wrong pizza. I called to ask if I could get the right one, they said no and hung up. Really???"
"PA","I know I give this pizza 5 stars, but it isn't the best pizza I have had - bear with me.  Gennaro's has a huge menu, fast delivery and a lot of food for a reasonable cost.  That earns it 5 stars.  The pizza is really tasty, and as a new resident of Pittsburgh, I'm finding it challenging to find a pizza place that just bowls me over... still hunting, but this is the best so far."
"PA","Consistently good pizza. Only place to get good deep dish pizza in the city. This place is better than any of the Sq Hill places people flock to like Mineos."
"PA","I ordered a small chicago style pizza. I had to write a review to warn others- it's not true chicago style pizza. Also, the ingredients are a 6/10 at best (tomatoes are diced canned kind, sausage is teeny tiny and slightly chewy). But if you don't mind the ""cheapy"" taste, go for it.

I'm from out of town and have a hard time finding places that serve great food in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, this chicago-style pizza from Gennaro's falls neatly into the sub-par category along with the others. I think next time I'll try Proper Brick Oven even though it's more expensive."
"PA","This has become my go-to pizza spot in the south side for 3 reasons. I'll expand below. 
1. It's fast and easy to order (online)
2. The price is great for the amount of food you get 
3. The food is consistently good

1. The online ordering is efficient and I've never had to deal with showing up at the store and them not having my order ready. You can order from your desktop or mobile. The order process is easy and you can pay with your card or select paying with cash.

2. I've tried many other pizza places in the south side area who charge $20+ for a large pizza that really isn't that great. Gennaro's allows you to get a large amount of food for under $20. My go-to order is a 1 topping medium pizza and 1 order of cheese twists (think pepperoni roll type of goodness). The total is just over $19 which is a great deal. The hoagies there are also HUGE if you get the full size. 

3. The food is good. Not great, certainly not horrible but it's good. The crust is usually soft and they have a good cheese to sauce ratio for my liking. I've only had the red sauce selection so I can't speak to the many specialty white pizzas they offer. The twists are delicious and make a great addition to any order. The breadsticks are big and fluffy. The only item that I had and would not get again are the wings. The wings were basically deep fried wings with bbq sauce poured over them, they didn't take the time to toss them and get them nice and saucy. 

Overall if you're looking for solid affordable pizza in the south side Gennaro's is a great option."
"PA","Solid Pizza at a fair price.

I get this for work a lot and have found the quality to be consistent.  It's not the greatest pie ever but for the price it's good and the pies area good size."
"PA","First, notice this little place has an application for liquor license on the door.  Just what this area needs, another liquor license!  Did not realize that Gennaro's had such a large menu.  Lots of pasta, sandwiches, salads...not sure how such a small place can have such an extensive menu, but I digressed.  

The pizza sauce has herbal favors to go with the cheese on a thinner crust that was toasted just right on the bottom.  Also, the menu has deep dish pizza."
"PA","I love this pizza"
"PA","Second time i ordered Chicago style pizza thought i would give them a fair chance.
I lived in Cicago for 35 years i love Chicago pizza THEIRS IS NO CHICAGO PIZZA.
I don't know about the rest of the menu but you will be disappointed if you know pizza and expect a real Chicago experience. The dough is not right the ingredients are not seasoned enough. 
So stay away from ordering Chicago Style unless you have money to waste"
"PA","Late at night and hungry, I discovered the Cambodian place down the street is a cash-only business. I chose this place because it was the only restaurant on the block with an open kitchen (many kitchens close at 10PM). Desperate times called for desperate measures, and I really should have taken the time to research a better restaurant.

I ordered a seafood deluxe pasta dinner and chicken noodle soup. I was told it would take 10 minutes but it really took 30 minutes. I had planned on eating inside, but since it took so long, I asked for the meal to-go instead. By the time I got my food, I was pretty exasperated. The knot tying the bag was too tight, so I was unable to check the food; this meant I left without ensuring a fork was inside.

The food was very bad. I have no other way to put it. The pasta was completely tasteless. I know there was imitation crab in the pasta dish, but I can't decipher what else there was; I ate less than 10 bites. The soup was terrible, and I only had a few sips. The broth looked like Campbell's chicken noodle soup (except it looked like the same noodle as the pasta), but tasted saltier. The salad looked quite plain (seen better salads in an airport), but without a fork, I was unable to eat. The soup, salad, and pasta (with tip and tax) cost about $16, so I expect a decent meal at this price.

I realize this is a pizza place and I should have ordered pizza, but I didn't want pizza. I also think if you're going to have a full menu, you should be able to properly present what's on the menu. I would've been better off ordering pasta from Pizza Hut. Attempting to eat pasta with a spoon didn't help either. Next time you're in the area, just skip this place."
"PA","I am restraining myself from so many expletives but this place is effing horrible. The customer service is the worst I have ever experienced.  Don't ever ever ever ever order from here unless u want rude service, complete waste of money, cold food, high prices."
"PA","So I wanted delivery in the SouthSide and I was done with Dominos and Pizza Hut.  Lucky for me in my mailbox was a menu for Gennaro's Pizza & Pasta.    I remember stopping into this place after the bar one night a few weeks ago and ordered a feta and spinach slice.  I remember it being fairly priced and oh so good.  Anyways I wanted delivery.  I called up and the girl on the other end of the phone was so nice.  I had a few questions and she had no problem answering them for me.  I had a coupon for a pizza, wings, and a 2 liter.  I ordered wings with just wing dust on them.  A half extra cheese..half pepperoni pizza.  

Pizza was soooooo good.  I must admit the extra cheese side was so much better than the pepperoni side.  

Wings.  Split whole wings.   I loved the ""dust"" that was on them.  It was too spicy for my kids but I LOVED it!  I think these wings could have been better if they breaded them first.  The Ranch dressing that came with these wings tasted like it was the homemade type.  

Delivery was 45mins.   Food was super super super HOT when it came.  Delivery driver was nice.  

Well after writing this review....I think I am going to go order some Gennaro's!  I wonder if anyone has tried their pastas?"
"PA","The service was so bad  i almost walked out. Two young girls were on a computer didn't say hi just stood there at the counter and waited for us to order. They had a miserable demeanor and kept saying to one another ""i can't wait to leave "" this is annoying to me as a customer and not professional. I will not go back if the two miserable girls are working. Food was good. They need to hire less whiney unappreciative people."
"PA","I was not too impressed with Gennaro's. I had a slice of the regular cheese. The crust was a thinner, NY style in consistency and texture, yet did not have the crispness necessary to make the crust good. The cheese was decent and the sauce was a little on the sweet side. It was not a bad slice of pizza, just not very good. I wish I would have known to get the deep dish. It looks really good."
"PA","Tried this place based on Yelp reviews for a recent lunch.  We decided to try both the Chicago style and regular pizzas.  I will say both of these pizzas were very good.  Delivery was fast and the pizza arrived hot.  Will definitely be back."
"PA","We call this place ""Secret Pizza"" because of how amazing it is and how hard it is to find when you're shitcanned. But it's our Secret Pizza, and we love it no matter what. Hoes down, G's up."
"PA","I Am Former New Yorker So I Know My Pizza. My Husband & I were walking on the Southside We decided to go to Gennaro's for dinner. He ordered 3 slices Xcheese & pep. And I order a Seafood Fettachini Dish. Well the pizza was layered w/ burnt sauce and dry cheese the seafood stuff was over cooked noodles watery sauce and old under cooked shrimp. They did give me a refund for the seafood & a homeless guy outside got the other 2 slices. Restaurant was sticky/dirty & out of date. Girl behind counter that took the order looked high on something. Avoid this place the locals say try Sal's."
"PA","First things first, ""Chicago"" style pizza is not pizza, it's a gimmick. Some restauranteur came up with a gimmick and it caught on. Is it Italian? Even New York Pizza isn't considered true Italian. Thin dough, olive oil, fresh tomato, whole milk or buffalo mozzarella, and fresh basil. That's a true Italian gem.

Let's dissect a Chicago pizza, why does the crust taste like biscuit dough? 'Nuff said. Sausage between the layers of dough? So you steam the sausage? Sounds disgusting when you think about it. Fresh tomato and any other topping and a sprinkle of romano on top. Basically a Chicago style pizza is a quiche, minus the eggs of course. It's American, and Chicago can have it.

Four stars for little chicagos regular pizza!"
"PA","This pizza is amazing. I cannot speak for the authenticity and all of that, but good pizza is good pizza. The deep dish is what you need to get. I can't even eat a small in one sitting and I am a pretty big eater.

The inside of the place is a dive. You can eat in but it's got the feel of a take out place mostly, for instance, you have to get your soda at a pop machine inside. But yeah, the pizza is quite phenomenal. If you get the deep dish. DOWN SIZE. It will fill you up fast."
"PA","I USED to love Little Chicago's.  When I first moved here, it was the only pizza I knew, and the only I cared to know.  The pizza is deliciously cheesy and greasy; which is perfect for a late night slice of pizza.

But now that I've tried the likes of Pizza Sola and Blue Grotto; Little Chicago's doesn't seem quite as tasty. 

Nevertheless, I wanted a pizza delivered tonight, so I called Little Chicago's.  At 11:30, on a Thursday night.  That doesn't seem like a tall order for a pizza joint that delivers.  But the phone call I just experienced would suggest otherwise.  The girl that answered the phone seemed...perplexed.  Why...what...where....do you want a pizza delivered???  It seemed a foreign concept.  Really?   

I know that every time I've been in there, the employees have been in an alternate state of being...but seriously.  So much so that you forget you're working in a delivery pizza joint!?  

It was really disconcerting to call a pizza place at 11:30 on a Thursday night (a Monday night, maybe?) and catch them off guard and confused about an order as simple as ""large pepperoni, delivered""."
"PA","Their Chicago-style pizza is delicious with chunks of seasoned tomatoes and gooey cheese nestled inside. Their other pizzas are quite tasty as well. Delivery is quick and easy. I can't speak to the authenticity of their Chicago pizzas, but I'll be returning many a time to Little Chicago's."
"PA","Wow! That's what I have to say about their ""Hot"" sauce, Wow! I can't get enough of it. Whatever sauce is left after the wings, I dip the bomb-ass breadsticks in. Yummy Yummy Yummy. They have great specials and the girl that usually answers the phone is super nice."
"PA","I'm planning a wedding in Pittsburgh from San Francisco. I've asked the owners for information 3 times by email and had my mother call them. The owner refuses to give any price information until you or a family comes to see the property in person. I'm a little offended at how the owner feels my time is just available to go look at his venue before I even know if the place is within my budget. It is difficult enough to plan a wedding from across the country to begin with, but when the owners of a venue won't even send you info, it makes it all the more difficult. The photos make the place look really gorgeous but the other reviews on here must ring true if the owner won't even show you the costs first!"
"PA","Hello Chuck, We just wanted to say ""thank you"" again for all you did to make our ""kids"" Mike and Stephanies wedding so lovely and enjoyable. The setting was just out of this world and the pampering was great. I would recommend the Morning Glory to anyone who would want an intimate outdoor wedding.

Thanks again."
"PA","I never actually stayed here myself but I spent a day there for my friend's wedding and reception.  

I thought that the place was perfect for the fairytale wedding my friend had always wanted.  Including a balcony full of flower girls dropping rose petals on the bride and groom.  The entire wedding and most of the reception took place outside in the very private very lush courtyard.  I would have never believed that a place so beautiful could exist just behind the busy south side bar scene.  Tucked away like a golden jewel for safekeeping.  

The owners were pleasant and completely accommodating.  My friends had booked the entire hotel so we got to go in to all of the rooms. I loved the feel of the place and would love to go back there again soon.  Maybe even get married there someday who knows..."
"PA","I have not stayed at the Morning Glory Inn as a guest, but recently spent a day there for a wedding & reception. 

I grew up in Pittsburgh and left years ago when it was in steep decline, so I think it's great when I come back and see some of those old neighborhoods being revitalized. Kudos to the developers of the Morning Glory for recognizing the potential of this charming old building. I have to be honest and say that while the Inn has a lot of character and personality, much of it feels a bit too... dingy for my tastes. I imagine the job of turning one of these old row houses into a B&B would require a Mike-Holmes-style gutting and restructuring, but in some places it feels like new wallpaper, paint or carpet was just laid over whatever was already there since time immemorial. The cobblestone courtyard is cute, but it's very uneven and the stones are in disrepair, which can be treacherous for elderly wedding guests in heels. I'm sure it's difficult to walk the fine line between retaining historical authenticity and providing fresh, modern facilities, so I'm inclined to be forgiving. I don't think I'd be comfortable staying at the Inn, though. Maybe it's just too many childhood memories of claustrophobia-inducing, mildewy, decrepit row houses. 

The one thing which really stood out about the Morning Glory was the proprietor's attitude. He seemed cranky, rude and almost annoyed at having people in his inn. At first I thought it was my imagination but other guests were commenting on it as well. Whether he was hollering at the guests ""Listen up!"" like a high-school gym coach, or shoving people back into the corners of the courtyard to make room, we kept asking ourselves, ""what is his problem?"" We didn't experience anything remotely like the other reviewers here who had their reservations cancelled, but I can certainly see the likelihood of that kind of treatment based on our observations. The wedding was nice but the creepy atmosphere in the Inn made me want to get out as soon as possible. 

And this atmosphere suddenly seemed to make a little more sense when we explored the sitting room / library on the second floor, which was well-stocked with hardcore right-wing political diatribes from especially obnoxious pundits like Glenn Beck and Neal Boortz. Of course everyone is entitled to his or her ideology, but a B&B really seems like a strange place to bring in politics. Classic literature, travel books, gardening, maybe a history of the South Side, certainly; I presume one goes to a B&B for relaxation, calm, peaceful reflection. These are not emotions one would associate with Beck, Boortz and their ilk. To be fair, nobody cornered us in the hallway to lecture us on the evils of Obama's impending Nazi dictatorship; but the library just reinforced our impression that the owner of this place had something stuck in his craw. And I don't really have any desire to go back to learn more about whatever that may be."
"PA","Originally posted 7/9/2010:
Just wanted to warn Yelpers about this place. We made reservations in March for an October wedding party and were told today (July 6) that everyone's reservations have been cancelled. The bride-to-be was told that a higher-paying party had reserved that date and that, literally, ""That's life."" They have an F rating with the Better Business Bureau, now we all know why.

Edit 9/18/2012:
I'd like to thank Dave for the sincere apology I've received here on Yelp, two years and nearly three months, after the fact."
"PA","The Morning Glory Inn is tucked into a cozy neighborhood in the South Side or historic district of Pittsburgh. The owners, Dave and Nancy, go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable!

Nancy cooks an amazing breakfast every morning--pomegranite blueberry juice, fresh brewed coffee with Belgium waffles and fresh fruit the first morning. The second morning, I awoke to fresh squeezed orange juice and lemon souflee pancakes!

Whether you are traveling to Pittsburgh for pleasure or business, I would highly recommend this B&B!"
"PA","I stayed here last night, so I could safely enjoy all of the south side festivities after a sb win.  This is a very relaxed B & B which is good for me.  Did that just rhyme?  Okay, regrettably I can't give a full and complete review because my total time spent here awake not including my shower was about 7 minutes.  I did take a few pics so that may fill in some of the blanks.  It's located off of Carson St. at 21st and Sarah.  It's close enough to E. Carson that you can do the full loop if you are so inclined.  Check in is at 2 PM, but I arrived around noonish and was able to go right in.  The parking is on - street except for a couple of spots in a small lot to the side of the building.  The guy I spoke with said only park in the lot if I can't find a space.  Well, I've been side swiped enough in the s. side to know how welcome off street is, so I can't say I looked too hard for an on - street spot.  The building itself is quite nice and historic.  It has iron gates, high ceilings, marble and cherry wood.  The entrance is a big double door that was wide open.  They have a lock on it, but it wasn't activated.  The first floor is large with a couple sitting rooms to your right a few tables for breakfast and a kitchen in the back.  There also is a courtyard in the back, but I didn't use it.  I was pretty singleminded yesterday.  I entered and there was a note to my left with my name on it and directions to my room.  I call the phone number to let him know I arrived and that was the first and last interaction I had with any staff of any sort which is fine with me.  He also seemed pretty disappointed when I told him I doubt that I'd be up by 830 AM for breakfast.  He said he would make me whatever I wanted and I'm pretty sure I missed out on a good breakfast this morning.  My room was at the very top of the house two long flights of steps up.  It was the margaret jackson suite.  The bedroom itself was pretty small with this 13"" tv in the closet for my viewing pleasure.  However, the bedroom did also have a sitting area next to the room with a nice fireplace some chairs and books.  The bed was crazy comfy.  It was one of those swede temperpedic deals that costs like a million bucks!  It was the first time I slept in one and it was great.  The bathtub was okay and stalked with some surprisingly decent shampoo/conditioner, however no soap.  Luckily I bring my own.  I left arround 10 AM this morning.  The total cost was $200.  You can stay at the holiday inn on 10th for about $50 less, but I think I'll try this place again and not skip breakfast this time.  I hear this place does a lot of business for receptions and is quite good if you have a small wedding party.  One last thing that was weird.  There is no door from the bedroom to the bathroom.  So, if it's your first getaway with that special someone be prepared to really get to know them.  There is no privacy from the bedroom to the bathroom.  Hopefully the other suites provide a little more privacy."
"PA","Stopped in for dinner around 7 on a Wednesday and it was very dead. I ordered the blue cheese burger after hearing that it is very similar to Tessaro's. The only similarity that it shares is that they are both grilled on a wood fired grill. The burger was unbelievably bland, the char grilling made the exterior very bitter, and the bun was rather tasteless. For my choice of side I went with fries. I was excited when they first arrived, they looked like they were going to be crunchy and delicious, unfortunately they were greasy and limp. The only positive aspect of the meal was our very friendly and attentive server. I'm not sure if I will give City Grill another shot, I just know that if I do I will skip the burger."
"PA","Ate here on the last night of our (Mikie, Sarah & I) Fatty Weekend trip.  We had been walking and knew we needed food before starting out drinking shenanigans but probably chose this place because of the bar we could sit at.

Good grub and a cool bartender that was attentive and had a nice dry wit.  I had a tasty burger and even more tasty Jack and Coke...or 3.  I don't quite remember.  I think there were some shots too.  Right? It's probably best that I don't remember..."
"PA","I'm surprised it has taken me this long to try out City Grill.  I think the South Side has some excellent restaurants, but I always felt it was missing a middle of the road, good meal, doesn't need to be an occasion to eat there sort of place....  City Grill is that sort of place.

Great burgers.  I'm not a burger expert, and I won't make comparison claims about these guys...but I really enjoyed mine.

I had the Brie cheese and horseradish burger.  It was great, would order it again (BUT I had huge food envy of everyone else with their bacon cheeseburgers.)

Burger was good exactly to order.  Fries were good as well.

Service was also very good - bartenders and waiters alike. 

This restaurant is a solid place to enjoy a great burger and some beers - usually without the usual South Side Bridge and Tunnel crowd that pack all the other bars."
"PA","Although it's been a couple of years since I visited City Grill to eat dinner (which at the time was very enjoyable-I recall having a calamari salad), I frequently pass by it after a night out on the Southside and have discovered that it's one of the best places to get a late night snack. They offer pizza, either whole or by the slice, outside of the restaurant. It's quick and easy and if you're on the Southside to begin with, it will save you from having to drive somewhere to find a snack. It's only $1 for a piece and $6 for the whole pizza. Although toppings are limited (only cheese or pepperoni), it's always great. Not to mention that the staff is very friendly and will always let you wait inside on a cold night. A very good find!"
"PA","Hamburgers.

Really good ones.

Get the Hamburger with the blue cheese on it.

Soggy fries."
"PA","The Ultimate Burger; served with brie and horseradish. 
Cooked to PERFECTION.
I love burgers more then anyone I know, I eat them everywhere and anywhere, and this one of the most superior burgers I have ever had.

The atmosphere is really mellow, especially for a joint on the southside.
The menu is simple, and everything seems to be done with care.

My server was great, a bit cold,but fast and accurate. Just the way a server should be."
"PA","I agree with the other reviewers, the burgers here rival Tessaro's.  Make sure you also check out their grilled wings. Some of the best wings in the city.

**Update - service has been decreasing in quality lately. Be prepared for loud/rude/drunk and/or slow service in exchange for the good burgers and wings."
"PA","I agree pretty much with the other reviewers that the burgers are fantastic.  I happened upon here today for lunch and can't believe in all the years I've been hangin in the s. side I never stopped prior.  The space itself is very nice it has exposed brick a nice bar with plenty of seating and multiple booths with dark wood and leather all around.  The only one complaint that I have about my initial impression is that it did  smell a little bit like my basement used to smell after a keg party in college when I first walked in.  I was greeted warmly by one of the servers ""Li Li"" I believe.  She was very friendly and we chatted for a while.  The bartender was ""Bear"".  He was a good typical burgh' bartender.  He served me a guiness quickly and knew the point spreads for all the college and pro games.  I ordered the ""ultimate burger"" which I ordered medium and they let me substitute a cup of french onion soup instead of getting fries.  Incidentally, they were very amenable to all kinds of sub stitutions as I witnessed while others ordered at the bar.  The soup was forgettable.  The broth itself was tasty enough and well seasoned, but the cheese wasn't burnt, it looked like they skipped putting it under the broiler.  It really doesn't matter the burger was the main feature.  Incidentally, I had no idea that this place was known for burgers, so it looks like I lucked out with the order.  The burger arrived quick enough it was a big 8 oz. burger overflowing with brie.  The burger was served on a perfectly toasted warm italian roll.  The burger itself was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  I'm pretty sure this meat is ground fresh daily and never frozen.  It very much reminded me of a Tessaros burger (and quite frankly maybe it was just as good, but I can't bring myself to say it).  The staff was so friendly I found myself staying for 3 guiness instead of a typical 1 beer lunch portion.  I will go again and stick to the burgers.  The rest of the menu was very reasonably priced, but again I think the burger is the star.  Incidentally, I was speaking with a friend in the restaurant business after lunch and the guy who originally opened tessaros is the current owner of city grill, so that accounts for much of the similiarity."
"PA","I agree with the other reviewers, the burgers here rival Tessaro's.  Make sure you also check out their grilled wings. Some of the best wings in the city."
"PA","Burgers, burgers burgers.  This was the best hamburger I've had in years.  I've had most every burger on the NYC best 100 hamburger over 3 years and can say that this would rank at the top.  I'm glad Fatheads was too busy because now I know where to go for the best burger in Pittsburgh.  Try it you won't regret it."
"PA","Maybe their exhibits are decent, but their service for members is certainly not. 

I paid $50 membership fee and provided all my contact information and email address. Never received any communication regarding upcoming events, classes, discounts etc. The only email they cared to respond to was how to pay the membership fee. Never a response to my other inquiry emails. Not recommend to become a member."
"PA","Another little hidden gem in the South Side.  I've stopped by for a few recent exhibits (Dawoud Bey's class pictures and Isa Leshko's elderly animals) this year.  Again, a place I ignored when I lived in the South Side and I'm not sure why.  

When I've been the place is remarkably quiet - I could have used some music.  But it's a simple gallery where you can walk through and no one bothers you (at least when I'm there). 

My interest in the exhibits is truly what finally got me inside the door after all these years.  Silver Eye is open and free to the public.  Worth a stop if you're nearby and it won't take up much of your time."
"PA","Great gallery, wonderful classes. I enjoy their exhibits and gallery openings. Very good staff with passion and expertise for photography."
"PA","CLOSED... Unfortunately...

We need more French restaurants in the Burgh."
"PA","Le Pommier is a cozy French restaurant that only serves dinner. I will start off by saying that all of the staff are friendly and helpful and the environment is warm and inviting.

I chose the fixed price menu, which included a salad with chèvre cheese, Steak with ""pomme frite"" (french fries), and a dessert (Les Smores). 

The salad was tasty, especially with the cheese. The steak was cooked well, but the french fries sort of took over the dish. I was slightly disappointed with my dessert. ""Les Smores"" was a few slices of toasted marshmallows with hard graham cracker-like cookies topped with bitter orange sauce. 

My date ordered the mussels to start, which are served with arugula and sausage in a very tasty white wine and butter broth. We used the leftover broth to dip our bread! For the main course he chose the pheasant, which was cooked perfectly. He also chose a delicious seasonal dessert: a squash crème brûlée. It tasted like creamy, spicy, autumn-y goodness.

We also shared a nice bottle of Riesling. 

Overall, I was pleased with Le Pommier but found that it was a bit pricey for its small portions and limited menu."
"PA","I loved everything about it- except my entree!  Hear me out:

We had a bottle of wine, appetizer, salad, and ""dessert"" as well as the main course.  The mussels were served in an amazing broth, the salad had the best roast duck I've ever tasted on it, and I loved my cheese platter for dessert.  I even liked my companion's entree (he had this amazing braised pork leg, cooked beautifully).

It was just mine that sucked.  From the description, I was expecting crabmeat accented with scallop ""mousse"" with a cold horseradish-tomato salad on the side.  What came out on my plate were 4 miniature seafood souffles paired with raw tomatoes.  They were okay, but nothing to write home about- but everything else WAS!

I will go again."
"PA","First off let me say this, if you want authentic French cousine... go elsewhere this isn't anything close to resembling real french cuisine.

That being said, we went here for a birthday dinner.  The atmosphere was charming and quaint.  The waitstaff was kind and willing to explain if there were any questions.  The food... was... boring.  Completely boring.  There was nothing resembling what i have expected.  Being that I've eaten real french cousine cooked by a frence chef, this was a let down.  At almost 300 for all of us... I would never, ever go there again.  Even the desert was lacking.  The wine was bland.  The entree was overcooked and underwhelming.

They should consider hiring a chef who is familiar with authentic french cousine, or change the name of the joint."
"PA","I will start out by saying that the entrees here are absolutely wonderful, and the atmosphere is warm, charming and quiet.  The appetizers were hit or miss, but nothing is amazing.  I had the monkfish cheeks for my main course and it was cooked perfectly.  It is definitely expensive, but the waitstaff is pleasant,  the entrees are splendid, and the atmosphere is very pleasant.  It's the perfect place for a pre-movie or play date I would guess."
"PA","as a lover of french cuisine I have been wanting to try this place for a while now. My husband and I finally made it there for valentine's day weekend and after seeing the special menu for the evening I had really high hopes. 

The waiter brought us an amuse bouche - smoked bean puree on an endive leaf and a duck prosciutto with a raspberry balsamic reduction. The portion for the smoked bean was too large for an amuse bouche and the taste was ok, a little flat taste wise, my husband did not care for it at all. The prosciutto was well balanced with the raspberry reduction and was the prefered portion of the plate. 

The next course was the appetizers - a trio of small dishes. A brown butter almond soup with some fresh creme and chervil. This was the best on the plate, lovely flavor and not too rich. Next was veal with a citrus glaze on a skewer. The veal was very tough and bland, very disappointing.  Finally was an oyster on the half shell with shallot. I was expecting something very different as I have had raw oysters prepared this way a few times when I have been in France. I was expecting a small amount of vinaigrette with some small pieces of shallot - what we got was an oyster with a pile of shallot that was been sauteed (?) in a vinaigrette. way too much on top that it ruined the flavor of the oyster, plus there was none of the natural juice from the oyster left. 

The salad came next. baby filed greens with chilled steamed asparagus topped with a fresh goat cheese - lovely and fresh flavors. the chevre was excellent quality and taste. 

Finally was the main course. I opted for the quail over a Gorgonzola risotto. First, I was surprised with the choice of a blue cheese, why not use a french blue? But it was very tasty and the quail was well seasoned and prepared. There were also some crispy onions which added little to the dish but I liked the green beans. My husband picked the fillet with an avocado horseradish mash with crisped potatoes (think potato sticks) He was very happy with his dish overall. I tasted it, loved the mash - I had never had that combination before, the avocado lent a creaminess to it and the horseradish - love this stuff - added a subtle peppery like spice to it. Very nice. The beef was well prepared as well.

The final course was a desert sampler. 3 truffles - none of which were terribly good, IMO. The dark chocolate with rosemary was the best of the three, the sesame with white chocolate I would have spat out had I not been at a restaurant and the lavender in milk chcolate tasted like I was eating perfume - much much too strong. Thankfully the other desserts were much better. A tartlette filled with some sort of dark cherry filling topped with a cream cheese. As a huge fan of fruit tarts I was happy - especially once i pulled some of the cream cheese off the top. The crust had a great texture and flavor and the cherry filling was excellent. The best,however, was the chcolate macaroon passion fruit ice cream sandwich drizzled with a passionfruit caramel. I am still thinking about how delicious this was the next day. A complete homerun. 

The restaurant decor, itself, was nice if not a tad boring and uninspired - we dined in the upstairs dining room - maybe it feels more authentic downstairs?  Some french music piped in was charming. The service staff was very friendly and attentive. The dishes were beautifully presented as well. 

I don't think we will go out of our way to go again. While it was one of the better meals we've had in Pittsburgh - we have not had much luck since moving here -  Le Pommier did not really live up to what I was expecting - especially for an almost $200 meal. That said, I would not rule out going again, maybe the a la carte menu is better?"
"PA","I'm basing this review on one dinner I ate here about a year ago. The food was AMAZING (the best pork I've ever had), but the prices were definitely steep and the atmosphere felt slightly uppity and rigid. My friends and I felt like we had to talk at a whisper as to not offend anyone around us. I love the South Side area though - you can definitely spend a nice afternoon and evening strolling down Carson St."
"PA","I had wanted to try this place for a while and finally got my chance the other day after my friend Hanna suggested.  It's a small restaurant on E. Carson St.  You enter off the sidewalk and walk into a small arrival area with a very small bar to the right.  The bar really isn't that functional and I'm guessing not used too much.  The dining room is bright with relaxing colors and a bookshelf on one side of the room and large windows with a view of the street on the other.  It has a ""homey"" feel to it.  The tables are reasonable spread apart with fresh flowers on each table.  We were sat at a good table with a nice view of E. Carson.  The service is better than average.  We had a friendly waitress who was pretty error free except for forgetting my friends glass of wine.  The meal started with some nice crusty french bread with room temp. butter.  Then I had the pate', which was not what I expected being pork instead of liver.  Nevertheless, it was very tasty.  My friend had a good looking salad.  My entree' was the chicken.  This was delicious and it was how chicken should be served in a restaurant.  It wasn't just the breast, but some of the tastier cuts served in a nice broth with root vegatables.  It was delicious and total comfort food.  My friend had the trout, which looked very good.  We both had the sorbet, which was delicious.  I especially liked the coconut flavor.  This was a great meal for a very reasonable $35 each prix fix.  The wine selection was pretty good.  I'll definitely go again."
"PA","I guess this place is alright. Nothing terribly impressed me. The wines were pretty good? The service was very good. Atmosphere was nice. 

The food was solidly boring. The menu is a little dull to choose from. The desserts were quite good though. Execution was okay, but not so amazing to make up for the menu being quite unimaginative. I wanted the veal cheeks, but apparently they weren't up to snuff so I had the pork which was fine. Everything was just fine. I guess for the price point, I would expect a little more?"
"PA","Awful place.  Disgusting.  Filthy."
"PA","This is an okay place to go when it's not crowded (weekdays!!).

 I've noticed lately on Fridays & Saturdays that it's the hip bar to head to. The line to get in & ID'd reminds me of Diesel.  It seems to be the go-to place since Levels closed down. The line to get in and your waist checked for weapons wraps around the side of the bar.. weird. I don't remember it being that busy before. 

Anyways, I head here on a week night when they have good specials. On the weekends, the crowd is just too packed and rowdy for a smaller space.

Our bartender was nice and their fresh cut fries were also good.  $1 well drinks Thursday 10pm-midnight"
"PA","This is going to be short. If you walk in to a bar and the first thing they do is frisk you...turn around and walk right back out because you're in the wrong bar. We also walked by later to see three policemen outside. That is all."
"PA","Margaritaville is what I would categorize as one and done. Meaning I have only gone there once and would never return.  The bartender got into a screaming match with a customer not cool and it made me feel very uncomfortable.  The bathrooms are disgusting and every surface in the entire bar seemed to be covered in some sort of sugary slime.  Margaritaville needs a hose down."
"PA","Heard a lot of word-of-mouth about this place, and decided to accompany my fiance and her friend for her friend's birthday celebration on a Saturday night.  Interesting that NO ONE seemed to be drinking Margaritas in a place called Margaritaville.  Security at the door is standard at a lot of Southside places, but clearly there is a need for it here..  I believe I actually interrupted a drug deal in the men's room.  It got more crowded as the night progressed, and overcrowded to the point where we felt unsafe.  I was afraid to let my fiance go to the restroom alone, and insisted they go together.  They ran out of glasses while we were there.  Mixed drinks in plastic cups are for frat parties, not a professional establishment.  Maybe it's better during the week, but no more Saturday nights at Margaritaville for me."
"PA","25 cent beers with a chance of blackout.

Yes, you read that correctly....25 cents....That is how much a beer cost on wednesday nights. I know what you are thinking. ""no way is a full beer 25 cents."" As a matter of fact, youre right, its a half of beer, perfect chugging size.

Now if you find yourself ballin on a budget be aware that everybody else is also ballin on a budget. You aren't going to rub elbows with the elite of the Pittsburgh working class, but does that make it less fun? Not at all. On wednesday nights it's a very mixed crowd. I have drank with homeless men, guys with rolls of hundreds, and the normal working american. 

Friday and Saturday nights are good too, just like the rest of the south side. You wont spend more then 2 bucks on a beer between 10-12 and the frozen margaritas are just delightful tequilla slushies which is never a bad thing."
"PA","Hit or miss. 15 cent wings on Tuesdays are nice but this place is very off with drinks: twice I got margaritas here and each time, I was overcharged. And the last time, my drink was in a little plastic cup, because they ran out of glasses! I paid more for LESS alcohol. Not a good look."
"PA","Ten cent wing Thursdays! Not the best wings, but pretty damn good and real cheap!"
"PA","Margaritaville has specials every night of the week on food and drink. A large draw for the college crowd is their 25 cent draft night on Wednesday, but others will enjoy their 10 cent wing night on Thursdays. The highlight of this bar has to be their karaoke night. Since the bar doesn't attract only one type of person, you're likely to get a mix of music as well with everything from Oasis to Kanye West with a lot of cover band favorites thrown in."
"PA","Great place to go dance, drink and have a blast. The girls dress very nicely in here. The beer is cold and very cheap. I have seen Pittsburgh Steelers in here before. Casey Hampton with a bottle of Grey Goose in one hand and his shirt lifted over his head with belly hanging out. Hines Ward, Ike Taylor, Deshea Townsend, etc. Wouldn't be surprised if Jeff Reed was there too breaking something in the bathroom. The place is actually really dark inside and if you just want to chill, there are places to grab booths. Also, the Marlboro people are usually in here handing out free stuff."
"PA","Had a great time here today loved the atmosphere and the customer service. Lots of cool designs and styles. I highly recommend this place! Awesome staff and awesome furniture."
"PA","Without a doubt, very nice furniture. But comparatively more expensive than other places. Was not thrilled with the customer service, you'd think for spending some thousands of dollars you would get free leather conditioner an/or free shipping. Girl told us she would call back to give us some names of places for free donation/removal, she didn't of course. The owner of Perlora ought to take some MBA basics of Sales Management to instruct his employees on the limits of authority they have (if he gives any) so they can speak intelligently of what they can do to make a sale, as well as teaching some plain and simple customer intimacy virtues."
"PA","Oh Mike & Tony's, how do I love you! The saddest part of moving out of Southside was the fact that I would no longer be able to walk a block to indulge in the deliciousness that is Mike & Tony s. If I was forced to eat something for every day the rest of my life, it would be the gyro special with extra onions. There is just something about a gyro from here that makes me so happy.

Service is always quick and really friendly. Gyros are hot and fresh and always taste amazing! I love their fries too, always goes good with a side of ranch. If you get it to go, they send you off with your gyro in a plain brown paper bag, just like a typical school lunch. Only this is way better than any school lunch i've ever had. 

Basically, you need to try Mike & Tony's. I sincerely miss being able to go there whenever I craved a yummy gyro, and I tell anyone and everyone to check them out!"
"PA","Not the same since it was sold years back. They changed the sauce and the gyros shrunk. Go to Mike & Tony's downtown for the best gyros."
"PA","When I'm in the mood for gyros, I go here. They are delicious and they give you a very generous portion. If you're not a fan of a ton of sauce I recommend you ask for it on the side. They give you a very generous portion of that also. My only complaint is that I get too hot in the restaurant due to the meat cookers radiating heat at the customers ordering in line. That being said, this is my favorite gyro place."
"PA","I have been a fan of this place for years! I love love love love love love this place. love! (get the picture?) =]. I have become a serious regular there- to the point that when I wasn't there for a month, an employee noticed right away lol. Amazing gyros!

My boyfriend and I order the same exact thing every time we come here. I get the chicken gyro special with ranch instead of cucumber sauce and an Iced Tea as my drink. The boyfriend orders the gyro special with everything on it and a Coke.

The food is always consistently good!

I adore the chicken gyro. They marinate the chicken for hours and it is obvious when you take a bite out of it. It's full of flavor and it's juicy! Since it's cooked on the grill, it has that charred taste to it slightly and I love that! The ranch is awesome too, although it is a little runny. The pita bread is amazing too- soft, but at the same time it doesn't get very soggy if you order take out. 

The fries are delicious too- although, sometimes the cook (depending on who is working) over fries them and they are a little too crisp for my liking. 

My boyfriend LOVES the regular gyro. Never anything to complain about there.

We are addicted to this place and do not plan on venturing out to try other gyro places. We already found our favorite!"
"PA","We ordered what they're famous for (gyros and fries) and...I loved everything about it, except the food, which was just okay.  The service was great, the staff were nice, but to achieve true greatness, I think the pita needs to be fried on the griddle with a bit of butter for crispy contrast, and the tzaziki does need a little zip, and even some cucumber.

Don't get me wrong: this is a solid entry in the ""what should we eat for lunch?"" quiz, but it needs a little more finesse to knock my socks off."
"PA","LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!

I absolutely love Mike & Tony's. My order is exactly the same every time I go (gyro, fries, iced tea, and an extra side of sauce for dipping fries and gyro). I moved away from Pgh for a few years and always made Mike & Tony's my first stop when I visited home. I've even eaten here 2 times in one day...they are that good! I'm glad to be home. Even though they are a good 20 minutes from my house, I probably go at least once every 2 weeks, if not every week.

The ambience leaves much to be desired, but I will chalk it up at character. But one bite of the best gyro ever and you won't care. Service is faster and prices are less than a fast food restaurant.

Keep in mind that they only accept cash. I don't see this as a deterrent. It helps them keep their prices low. If you forget your cash, they do have an ATM with a $1.75 fee. I'll gladly pay the fee to get cash for my gyro.

Did I mention I love Mike & Tony's? :)"
"PA","Yummy gyros for cheep. All ingredients are fresh and they make it right I front of you so you can see everything that goes into your gyro. Fast service. Food is ready in less than 3 mins. Perfect if you are looking for a fast meal or just like gyros. Hits the spot after a long night out on the Southside."
"PA","I loved Mike and Tony's ... But since they got taken over under new management a few years back I can taste the  difference and I don't like it at all..."
"PA","A gyro under 5 bucks? Yes. 

It was filling, tasty, and quick!  My friend and I biked to South Side for the sole purpose of obtaining a gyro. Under her recommendation we went here and let me tell you - it was worth the life risking bike ride. The bike ride isn't bad, I'm just a horrible biker, so getting here is actually quite easy. We ordered our gyros, went to wash our sweaty hands and came down to sit to our freshly made gyros. I love, love the gyro bread, the fluffy goodness that cushions your jaw with every bite. I would advise everyone to get this. EVERYONE."
"PA","Delicious and priced right."
"PA","Seriously, the BEST & biggest gyro I've found in Pittsburgh. Sometime's they'll have a deal for gyro, fries & a drink for around $7. Great deal for such a great amount of food! :)"
"PA","I'm from Pittsburgh and currently live in Atlanta...and am yet to find a gyro anywhere that even comes close...I get homesick when I think of Mike and Tony's!"
"PA","The only legitimate Mike and Tony's in my mind. Some of it is clearly nostalgia and bias, but the other franchise places do not have the same 'burgh feel. In the south side establishment, you walk in, order your gyro in a non-standard way, talk a little pittsburghese, and then go out and enjoy carson street. Its got the steel town vibe. doesnt get much better. Its IMPOSSIBLE to find a gyro like this on the west coast. Not only do they make them terribly, they scream at you for not calling it a YEERO. ugh."
"PA","Excellent gyros and great waitstaff. Cant recommend this place enough."
"PA","Easily the best Gyros in Pittsburgh"
"PA","Best food in the burg and great people that work there.  The pita bread is amazingly soft and the meat tastes amazing.  The prices are a steal as well.  It's so good it makes the parking situation worth it."
"PA","Let me paint you a picture. 

It's 2 am, the bars just closed and all of a sudden the only thing driving your feet forward is your hunger. For some reason after consuming gallons of alcohol all you wanna do is shove food down your throat. You are wondering around the southside with your friends, 2 girls you met in a bar and a random homeless guy who you thought was the funniest dude alive. All of a sudden you stumble onto a little shack type place with a lit sign outside that says ""mike & tony's."" 

My friend you have just hit drunk heaven.

For the rookie orderer at mike and tonys it may seem like the ""soup nazi"" skit from seinfeld. You need to know what you want, these guys move quick, they only take cash and the gyro is an even 5 bucks. Don't studder or they will move on to the next person until you are ready. Once you order, move to the right, wait for your bag and get the hell out! 

Usually by the time you get to the corner you have unwrapped it and taken your first bites of this magnificent spectacle. I've seen many a rookies first reaction. You slightly tear up at first, embarassed you wipe the tears of joy from your face. Then you look down at this magical wonder you have just traded for five dollars of currency and try to speak through your full mouth of tender lamb meat, ""this is the greatest thing I have ever eaten.""

They have won, Mike & Tonys will forever be a southside tradition now."
"PA","Best. Gyro. Ever.

This place is nothing to look at, but their gyros are hands-down the best I've ever had.  I always have to eat at least two, and have even been known to take down three.  I really wish I hadn't started writing this review.  I'm salivating and realizing I won't be back to Pittsburgh for months!

I think that a M&T Gyro should be the thing you get for out-of-town visitors instead of the overplayed Primanti's sandwich."
"PA","Best Gyros in town, hands down!"
"PA","Hands down best gyro in Pittsburgh in my opinion.  Possibly the best gyro ever.  Even at 2am when there's a line of drunk people waiting, the staff is quick and efficient.  Clearly they've been doing this for awhile.  The fries are not the best, but for some reason I always get them with the gyro because they taste so good together.  The gyro is so jam packed with goodness that when they hand it to you you don't think it's that big...until you unwrap the foil and start eating it.  I always eat mine so fast that I nearly choke.  I can think of no sweeter death.

I used to frequent Mike & Tony's on a regular basis when I lived in the South Side.  Now that I don't, I try to stop by whenever I happen to be in the neighborhood.  I just can't resist."
"PA","For a small local place - the food is great and you get what u pay for! I was here for the first time last week (1/27/12) - definitely will be heading back"
"PA","If you must have mystery meat snack after a night of over imbibing in South Side, make the stop at Mike & Tony's.  Add some fries.  Get some Ice Tea.  Jam the gyro and fries down, wash it up with some tea, and you'll feel ready to blow cookies when you walk out. This means you will feel satisfied on all counts. Seriously, it tastes good. We're all gonna die anyway right?  Oh, and if you get the meatshave gyro, get it with all the fixin's. C'mon, you know it's good!  Don't forget to pay...oh, you'll pay, alright."
"PA","You know what, these might actually be the best Gyros I have ever had. Mr Myers and Mr Danza should be proud of themselves.

I've never been to Greece, and if I had to think of a better Gyro, the only one that comes close, is Central Gyros in Chicago. I can't choose which one I like better, so I'm going to have to say they're jointly the best Gyro I have ever had, and therefore this really is the food gem of Pittsburgh. Of course you have to try Fiore's Pizza and Peppi's Roethlisburger too, but if you only have 1 meal, 1 time, in Pitt, and you like Gyros... here, my friends, is your Mecca. Brought to you by Mr Tyson and Mr Romo.

There are actually two locations of this, and because it had a shorter line, i think I like the Southside version better. But there is one downtown that caters to the lunch crowd, and they are excellent too. Another thing that is fantastic about Mike & Tony's is the price! Their Gyro (piled with juicy delicious meat, with loads of fluffy Gyro style pizza, sharp onions, juicy tomatoes, and creamy yogurt sauce), is cheaper than most burgers! Extremely impressive! Just like the founders, Mr Jackson and Mr Hopkins.

Gyros should be made a certain way. There's an exception, in Buffalo, where ""Gyros"" are something else entirely in some Greek diners, and are very good, if not as good as traditional Gyros. But what I cannot stand is those fake, frozen, pre-packaged Gyro strips. They are already cut out in Gyro strip shape, and they just grill those and bam, Gyros. No thank you! Gyros are supposed to be shaved off a large spindle, delicious and juicy and fresh... that's the only way to go. Add some yogurt sauce, onions and tomatoes on a Gyro Pita - the end. The best in the world are Mike & Tony's in Pittsburgh, and Central Gyros in Chicago. Nom nom nom. This place does Gyros RIGHT! So thank you Mr Jordan and Mr Soprano.

Parking is tricky and tight at both locations, so be careful. They're always a little tow-happy in Pittsburgh, though not as bad as NYC. Try around the corner from the Southside location, that's your best bet. I asked owners Mr Buble and Mr Bennett and they told me the same thing.

Mike and Tony's - you are absolutely outstanding!!!

My original review (what was I thinking)

One of the best Gyros in America, hands down. Very cheap too. Eat it while it's hot, that's the way it's supposed to be. Then let's make out, so I can taste some of that Gyro too. Well, no, I mean, I'd love to make out anyway, but tasting the Gyro is a bonus. OK OK, I admit it, I just want the Gyro taste! You caught me Blue-and-white handed! (the greek flag. Although there is nothing greek about this place. It just happens to make better Gyros than most Greeks).

So thanks again to Mr J. Fox and Mr Hawk for opening this place!"
"PA","Dear reader, 
I submit to you this humble comparison of two Gyro joints that sit within spitting distance of each other. But it's more profound than just bragging rights for the best Gyro, this is also a tale of Yelp vs. local word of mouth. You see, I was challenged by a friend not 30 minutes before on the quality of Yelp reviews vs. WOM. 

So I'm getting a ride from a local (thanks Bernie!) to the South Side, and he points out a Gyro joint as being the best in P'burg (Mike and Tony's) and then I see just across the corner another Gyro joint I recognized from Yelp reviews as having 4.5 stars. So it hits me. Let's put his tithe test. 

I asked to be dropped off, pull up Yelp and check reviews. Sure enough, my WOM rec, Mike and Tony's has only 4 stars, and Lesvos has 4.5. I see my opportunity to test local WOm vs. Yelp right then and there (and eat two Gyros instead of one!)

I won't belabor the results:

Mike and Tony's was a better experience for me, thought neither was perfect. 

M&T's - 4 stars
Lesvos - 3 stars

Now, keep in mind this is based on one visit, Gyro to Gyro. Sampling method is not perfect since there was a few minutes between eating each, and Mike and Tony's likely has an advantage since I was more hungry when I ate theirs (although I only ate half to try to control for this).  Here are some details:

M&T - total hole in the wall, but not in a bad way. Gyro came in seconds to my table, piping hot and absolutely piled with meat. It was juicy, and the pita had just the right amount of resistance. The meat was just a tad over seasoned, as another reviewer mentioned, but really food flavor overall. The tatziki sauce tasted like straight sour cream to me, with similar texture. It wasn't bad, but I prefer something a little mote delicate, with some lemon, cucumber, and a bit of yogurt tang. Overall, pretty freaking tasty. 

Lesvos - also pretty good ( and same price BTW), but just missing on a couple of things. The meat was a little dry, and though tasty, not quite as tasty. There was less meat although still a generous portion. The sauce was a tad more delicate, though still mostly tasting like sour cream. The bread was not bad, but just a tad more presence than ideal for perfect balance - a little too thick and chewy. 

Moral of the story? Not exactly sure, but if I had gone by Yelp alone, I would have missed out on the better Gyro just next door."
"PA","Mike and Tony's is a bit of a local novelty.  This little shack on 14th does produce a great Gyro at an affordable price.  I remember the first time I went in there it reminded me a lot of my first visit to In&Out.  Simple menu, so hurry up and order, there is a line behind you.  

What impressed me about this place was the quality of the meat and the quantity that they are able to load into the wrap.  Wow.  Normally I tend to ask for double/extra meat but at the time I only had $5 in my pocket so I went with normal.  But I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of meat they stuffed into the wrap along with the fresh vegetables.  

Every time I get a chance, I definitely walk through the door of Mike and Tony's to get a little slice of gyro heaven.

Cash Only"
"PA","So after reading the reviews for this place I was psyched to finally get my hands on a tasty gyro sandwich. I made the eleven minute drive from my apartment to Mike and Tony's Gyros and Shish-Kabobs and I was rather disappointed. 

French Fries: Delicious, crispy, golden brown. Crunchy on the outside and just the right amount of soft potatoey-ness on the inside. They were also piping hot and made to order.

Gyro: The meat was under-seasoned and the sauce was not very flavorful. I've definitely have had better tasting gyros. The bread was a little crunchy/hard on the edges. 

Coke: Delicious!!!

Maybe it was the rising expectations that led to this Mike and Tony's gyro experience being not so great so I've decided to give them another try in the future. Until then I will be trying the gyro shop on the next block!"
"PA","updated"
"PA","Best gyros (hard g) in Pittsburgh"
"PA","This place is classic Pittsburgh and I would probably send a journalist here rather than Primanti Brothers to give him a feel for 'old Pittsburgh'.  I've been going here since I was a kid.  It is dirty, cramped, low-ceilinged and dingy as the House of Usher, but the gyros are delicious.  Which is great since that's really your only option.  If you have an open lunch and are in the South Side, jump in here and enjoy a delicious unhealthy Pittsburgh tradition."
"PA","There are a lot of places that serve gyros in the area.  And everyone that I spoke to said this was the place to try -- and I spoke to a lot of people.  One fine day, I just happen to be near this location during lunch hour and figure I might as well try it.  The interior is a tad dark and dank which tends to make it feel a bit dirtier than it might have been.  The associates behind the counter were nice and were more than willing to help us.

I was happy to see the spits of gyro meat turning at the front of the store -- no precut freezer meat here.  We ordered the following at the counter:

Fries
Barqs
Plain steak pita with cheddar sauce
Gyro with tomato and tzitziki sauce on the side

Taking the rootbeer with us, we found a table.  It was a bit dirty from the previous customer and I couldn't figure out why -- the place was barren. The food was rather quick to come to the table and looked very good.  As I normally do, I tried the meat and the sauce separately.  The meat was over-seasoned while the sauce was underseasoned.  I don't even think that it was tzitziki sauce, but I went forward with my meal.  Trying to find that balance, I began adding the sauce to the gyro.  With each bite, I had to add more sauce.  It got to the point where I didn't want to add any more sauce.  Luckily, I had added enough sauce to enjoy the gyro. 

I tried a piece of the steak pita and went back to my gyro -- the steak was full of fat and gristle while also being tough.  I didn't need to eat anymore of it.  The fries were your standard freezer fare and were fried properly -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

In the end, I would say that Lina G's has a better gyro.  I really don't like my gyro swimming in sauce and if I have to choose between Mike's and Lina's, it will be Lina's every day.  It is much easier to add seasoning to an unbalanced gyro with sauce than it is to remove seasoning from the meat.

Still looking for a gyro that is balanced."
"PA","Yum yum yum. Hungry for Gyros? This is your place."
"PA","Good gyros, neat little place, sort of what South Side is all about"
"PA","The gyros are delicious and the walls are made of brick.  Solid brick."
"PA","This place is tucked away, but they serve delicious gyros/ spinach pies and have great prices. It's no smoking inside so even though it's small I don't feel suffocated."
"PA","Gyros the way I like them. Delicious ingredients in ample proportions. Fresh pita.  Fast service."
"PA","The BEST Gyros in Pittsburgh!

The meat perfectly seasoned as is the tzatziki.  I've tried other gyros around town and while there are good gyros to be found, each time I go back to Mike & Tony's I'm reminded of how much better theirs are!"
"PA","Looking at the exterior alone, I wasn't so sure I wanted to go into Mike & Tony's but because of the high ratings on Yelp they pushed me in. When we walked in we were greeted with the pleasant smell of seasoned meat. The interior is a no frills, basic set up all in brown with some pictures and articles up; an arcade machine and a flat screen tv, playing espn. I instantly felt at home with the casual environment. Ordered the gyro platter and was amazed just at how cheap everything was for what we got. The meat was cooked and seasoned well and the tzatziki sauce was a thumbs up. Pita tasted fresh. Even though I ate everything off my plate and my stomach was stuffed to the max, my brain was telling me more. I know we will be back though Mike & Tony's is cash only."
"PA","This is a great place to stop by for a quick bite, either for lunch break or late night after party munchies. They throw together a tasty gyro in minutes. $5 will get you a gyro packed with layers and layers of meat. I never thought I'd be saying this but there was too much meat. The meat to wrap ratio was just divine. The meat was beautifully seasoned, although slightly a bit salty. The sauce tasted straight up like yogurt. I wasn't very impressed. I wish there was more ""Tzatziki"" in the Tzatziki sauce. Overall, the gyros at Mike and Tony's really gave that bang for my bucks. Will come back!"
"PA","I've heard great things about this place! However, when we got there it didn't look like anything special, so we just got 4 regular pretzels (60 cents each!!) and went home. This was quite possibly the best pretzel I have ever eaten in my life. And it was cold. I wanted to drive back and get more! I definitely recommend this place if you love a quality pretzel."
"PA","I don't go here as often as I used to, which is a shame.

The Pretzel Shop is another Pittsburgh Institution. Made on the premises in large quantities, you can also buy a ton for very little. It makes places like Auntie Anne's look like amateurs. The pretzels taste great, and taste even better when you take home a full bag of 'em to eat later.

The sandwiches I've had here have been enjoyable as well. I usually get the sweet sausage pretzel sandwich or the open faced veggie pretzel. They're both tasty faves and I never had one of either that I felt was not up to scratch. The various cookies and other pastries they sell here are also quite good.

I've never seen The Pretzel Shop not busy. When I've gone in and it's been relatively empty, it only took about ten seconds before there were four or five people behind me. I've based trips to the South Side specifically to go here. It's one of a kind and deserves its reputation. Now if I can just get back to regular trips there once again."
"PA","Wonderful place. They gave a donation to our fundraiser. Great owners and delicious pretzels."
"PA","Love this place! Inexpensive. Great for a quick snack mid day. And they have a huge variety of items on their menu"
"PA","Here's the truth. There is no inside seating, and the outside seating is limited to two small tables on a noisy, high traffic street. The pretzels were all cold - even the ones we asked them to heat. Service was also ""cold"" and unhelpful, and the cashier seemed as though we were bothering her by asking questions.

I had a chicken salad sandwich on a pretzel bun ... Nothing special. My husband had a cheeseburger roll that was cold, even though he asked that it be heated.  We had to ask for dipping sauce as it was not offered to us.

This is a place to maybe pick up some pretzels to take home and heat up ... Definitely not a lunch place as some have suggested."
"PA","Only 50 cents for a warm and soft pretzel--worth every penny! The pretzel shop is such a charming little place that is perfect for grabbing a quick snack or light lunch. There are original salted pretzels (50 cents), flavored soft pretzels ($1), pretzel sandwiches ($3) and various fresh pastries. Cheap and delicious all in one package! I highly recommend giving this place a try if you're a carbs lover in the Southside area!

Also as a side note, they will heat up your pretzel if you request them to. Warm pretzels are the best!"
"PA","One of my favorite places in the South Side! The pretzels are delicious and the workers are so nice. Best time to get there is super early in the morning. If you drive around to the back ally  behind the building you can catch them right after the pretzels are taken out of the oven. 
So many great memories of driving down and picking up some pretzels before an early morning road trip."
"PA","I came here today on a bike ride and picked up a grilled chicken pretzel sandwich with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing for lunch.  The pretzel ""bread"" of the sandwich was wonderful--very chewy, savory, and delicious.  The fillings, on the other hand, did not impress me--while filling, they were bland and flavorless. The sandwich was also quite messy to eat, since some of the cheese and dressing had leaked out of it, despite its being wrapped up, and continued to leak as I was eating it.  Usually, two napkins is sufficient for me, but this is one of the few times I wish I'd picked up more of them.

In addition to my sandwich, I picked up a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie, which, though small, was tasty and full of chocolate chips.  Together, the sandwich and cookie cost a whopping $4.40 (take that, Subway!).  Service was friendly and efficient.

Based on the quality of the pretzel and the cookie, I'd come back here.  Next time, however, I think I'll try one of the regular pretzels, or perhaps a pizza one.  3.5 stars."
"PA","One of my favorite things about the pretzel shop is it's homey feel. They've got lots of funny signage about not using your cell phone in the store. Love it!

The pretzels are VERY salty and typically served cold. So if you're not into that, you're not going to like it. You can't beat the price. I often times find myself craving a pizza pretzel, which I believe is only $1.75. They're so good. It's a small portion, which some people complain about, but what else could you expect with price? I think it's more than what you pay for, though. Definitely a good value. 

My only complaint is the hours of operation, but with a small, family owned shop, I guess short hours can be expected."
"PA","This place is a pittsburgh MUST. I have been coming here for a long time and it just keeps getting better and better. My favorite item of theirs is their cinnamon sugar pretzel-- it is the best around. Their pretzels are soft and it is obvious that they are fresh. Their veggie pretzel is amazing- they have a ton of pretzel sandwiches which are awesome for lunches. Their mini pretzel pieces are so good and super cheap. Their baked items are incredible too! In the fall, I bought soft pumpkin cookies with white icing and they were literally the best pumpkin cookies I've ever had. I walked in the other week and they just had taken out tomato basil pretzels from the oven- oh my goodness... The mozzarella cheese was still melty and the tomatoes were hot- incredible. They also have an adorable back door with limited hours where you can purchase anything from the store plus bags of broken pretzels for a low price. I can go on all day about this place, it's perfect. They are super affordable and always are delicious!"
"PA","Best pretzels in the Burg!"
"PA","It was really cheap, but just didn't do anything for me when I got the pizza sandwich on a pretzel, of course. Maybe I'll go back and get their regular pretzels."
"PA","I heard about this place when I moved to Pittsburgh and everyone said that you had to go there and get Pretzels. Well I did and I don't see why everyone likes it so much. 

Don't get me wrong the Pretzels are good, but it's not life altering in anyway. 

My major beef with this place is their breakfast pretzel. It's like a salty sweet soft pretzel that is meant for breakfast. I think they are kind of gross. They seem to use regular table salt and sugar and the salt over powers the sugar and just tastes like a really salty soft pretzel. Which in my mind is not good for breakfast at all. 

When people at work get them and if I'm really hungry I have to say to myself before taking a bite ""salt...it's going to be salty"" and then take a bit. Else it takes me by surprise every time. 

Maybe I'm wrong, so try it for yourself"
"PA","These are the best pretzels in Pittsburgh.  Period.  It's tough to walk by and not pick up some pretzels to take home.

I recently used them to help cater a holiday party.  a.) It was only $20 for 50 freakin' pretzels.  b.) They had the order ready on-time.  c.) The pretzels were great as left-overs days later.  Win all around."
"PA","Get me early cuz they go quick! If you get them while they are hot you'll be hooked for sure! Best soft pretzel anywhere!"
"PA","Quite a disappointment for us.
We went there because of all the great reviews here. The plain pretzels were pretty good, not exceptional as they had been sitting there for a while and not warm but at least they were not greasy like some other mall pretzels can be. Unfortunately the pretzel sandwiches were disappointing. The have all the sandwiches pre- assembled  in the display case and when you order them they microwave them-- which heat them up but made everything soggy. The sausage in my breakfast sandwich was very salty. We were expecting a family version of Bruegger's Bagel or Panera, well this place is not as good. The price, however, was unbeatable in the Southside area. The two of us had a filling breakfast for under $10 though you do get what you paid for. We will not go back and will not recommend it to others."
"PA","This place makes some good chewy pretzels and the prices are ridiculously reasonable.  I liked the pretzels so much that I ate 5 of the 6 I bought within an hour...I was trying to save them for later, but things like this happen when food is addictive and good."
"PA","small shop with lots of choices.  Sandwich's are very good."
"PA","Although I pass this place everyday, I limit myself to only stopping once or twice a week. If there is an open parking spot in front of the shop, my car seems to always pull in on its own.

Over the years, I think I have tried every sandwich here and they all taste great. My personal favorite is the hot dog pretzel. It is a party in our mouth!

Lately, I've only been getting regular pretzels. At 50 cents a piece, how can you go wrong? If you don't like a lot of salt, make sure to tell them ""light salt"". Lunchtime lines can get a little long and remember they only take cash."
"PA","My Saturday errand-runs just wouldn't be complete without stopping here. The plain pretzels themselves are delicious, but when can have sandwiches it's to-die-for!

 I've had the chicken club, the veggie pizza, the chicken parm roll (!!!) & even their pasta salad & I've always been satisfied! Their pretzel sandwiches are usually $3.50 (score!!!) & they have all types of variety.. even gyro!

BUT my favorite and choice most of the time would be the breakfast ones! goodness that's perfect even at 2pm. I always make sure to bring Bobby a sandwich home for after work because he can't miss out- it's not fair! 

Update:: Bobby's officially had the Pretzel Shop experience! We don't even care that we have to sit on a random person's stoop for 2 min to scarf it down ;)

**They also have a load of different types of cookies and sweets.. & if you thought the pretzel sandwiches were easy on your wallet, wait till you see the cookie prices!! Buy a Pretzel Shop shirt to be super cool walking through the Burgh!"
"PA","This is South Side's gem. I have been eating pretzels from here since I was a kid. Not only do they have awesome pretzels, but they make really good sandwiches as well. Prices are decent and it always feels good supporting local businesses."
"PA","I've been going to the Pretzel shop for decades. DECADES! I used to go to the back ""door"" where the oven is and get the fresh out of the oven pretzels that would burn your hand even through the bag. These are amazing. They've been supplying all of Pittsburgh their soft pretzels since I can remember! A  bag of these taken to give out at work will make you a hero and not cost you an arm and a leg. 

My daughter lived on the Southside and while we were gutting her house and remodeling, I'd stop here every weekend and order our lunches. The sandwiches are KILLER. You haven't lived till you've had the hot dog wrapped in pretzel dough. And for $1.75 you can splurge for a couple and live like a king! The sausage pretzel sandwich heated while you wait so that it's super tasty is another clear winner! So too is the meatball sandwich roll - for $2.45? Are you kidding me??? A great place to get great food (more than pretzels!) at an outrageous price! You'll love it!

Oh yeah, they have pretzels too - flavored ones if you like. How about jalapeno, Cajun, garlic, or parmesan bacon? Spectacular!! But here's a tip, the BEST thing in here is NOT the pretzel. It's the baked goods. Their chocolate gobs are what your mother wishes she could make. Off the chart. Get two - and not to share! You're welcome."
"PA","This place is staple and one that I frequented when I lived in Pittsburgh.  The pretzels are always fresh, delicious, and inexpensive. They have a veggie pizza (on pretzel) that is amazing and pretzel dogs. They also have a wide variety of flavors for their pretzels and dipping sauces. When I visit, this is one of the ""must-go"" places for me.

You can't go wrong with The Pretzel Shop/"
"PA","I've been getting pretzels here since I was a little kid and they have always been amazing!"
"PA","Ordered a chipotle turkey pretzel sandwich. Cash only. $4 with tax. They'll ask if you'll want it warmed up or cold, get it warmed up with all the fixings. A bit messy and they did not include a napkin in the to-go bag so make sure you grab one. Other than that the pretzel was everything I imagined it to be - salty and soft which went well the turkey, tomatoes, lettuce and chipotle sauce."
"PA","The best pretzels in town!

When any of my coworkers has to go near the South Side they stop by and get a big bag of pretzels to share with everyone in the office.
Not only you get salted or unsalted pretzels but they also have stuffed pretzels and even pizza pretzels. A great place to stop by for a quick and economical lunch/dinner/snack.
Here you get quality and price. Don't be fooled by imitations. This place has been open for decades; there's a reason for that."
"PA","I know that I'm in the minority... but I really do not like The Pretzel Shop. My co-workers often pick up pretzels from here for birthdays or other office events, and everyone spends the morning raving about how delicious the pretzels are and how they cannot stop eating them. Am I missing something? I just sit quietly at my desk and raise an eyebrow at all this chatter. I've had them at least 5-8 times and cannot say that I've ever enjoyed them. The regular pretzels are either over or under salted (not sure if that is a preference the customer can select or if it's just random), and the cinnamon sugar just taste strange. They often taste very soggy, too, like they were bagged when still too warm. Occasionally, co-workers pick-up the ""cheese"" sauce. This stuff looks like a melted yellow crayon. I love all types of cheese, but this looks and tastes terrible. Yes, I'm being blasphemous towards a Pittsburgh tradition, I know, but I'm sorry, I'd much rather get a pretzel from Hofbrauhaus or even Auntie Anne's in the mall."
"PA","Mike W. As a life resident of Pittsburgh I grew up eating South Side pretzels outside of Mt. Oliver pool being sold out of a wicker basket.Now I can not go thru South Side without stoping.Not only did I bring my kids there I now enjoy brining my grandson.The pretzel Shop is a must visit frequently.8"
"PA","My favorite place by far on Carson Street.  I really don't know where else one can find perfect (not the greasy mall kind) pretzels for 50¢ a piece.  You can get real full off these things with a drink for less than $5.00.  Since pretzels are one of the few things I can never get sick of, I don't know what I'd do without this place.  They also have cheap dessert type foods that are alright:  nothing gourmet, but they work.  Plus, a ton of pretzel sandwiches which I have yet to try.

The only slight problem I have with the Pretzel Shop is the hours, as they never stay open past six o clock.  Other than that, I see no reason why any pretzel lover would avoid this place."
"PA","Definitely a unique location. If you are feeling adventurous, then you may want to try a pretzel sandwich. The first time I ordered a pretzel sandwich I was completely surprised by the sight. I thought I was going to have an ordinary sandwich with some sort of golden crusted bread; I was very wrong. The bread portion of the sandwich was a pretzel cut in half. The key to a good experience is figuring out how to hold the sandwich so that the contents do not fall out."
"PA","I grew up in Pittsburgh but now live in Texas. I always look forward to making my regular trip to The Pretzel Shop. Pick up 30 pretzels and I am good for two weeks. These pretzels are a Pittsburgh staple. Make sure to try the back entrance for a hot baked pretzel!!!"
"PA","I may be a hypocrite slightly.  I talk about how much I hate sandwiches.  But I think the epidemic in boring sandwiches turned me off.  I've been meeting more and more unboring sammies lately, which has made me actually start to crave them!

I had wanted to stop into The Pretzel Shop for a while and had heard they also serve sandwich and not just pretzels.  They actually have a whole case full of sandwiches and sides.  I opted for the turkey sandwich with horsey dressing on a pretzel bun (dah!).  

That pretzel bun... AMAZING!  It was so moist and doughy, and not too salty (which I hate about regular ones).  I also loved the tangy dressing.  It honestly made me want to come back and buy up the whole store of pretzels, that bun was so good!  You could probably buy the whole store for $20 everything is so cheap, cheap, cheap!

I'll be back now for my new pretzel sandwich habit, and probably a developing pretzel habit.  All thanks to The Pretzel Shop!"
"PA","Best pretzels in Pittsburgh! They use an Old World recipe and bake the pretzels in a traditional open hearth brick oven. Be sure to get some pretzels after they come out of the oven and are still warm - so good!"
"PA","Goodness. The shame. I've lived in the South Side for almost two years and just recently made my first venture to The Pretzel Shop. I picked the best day possible - National Pretzel Day - so I got a handful of extra pretzel nugs tossed in my bag as a treat. Score!!! 

I'm a pretzel junkie, and these delightful little nibbles from the pretzel Gods totally hit the spot. They reminded me of the mall pretzels I used to get; I think the name of the place was ""Hot Pretzel"" (real original, right?) only a little softer and a bit more yeast-y. 

They have far more than pretzel nuggets (twists, sandwiches, flavored, traditional), but I got enough to carb out for the day for a whopping $2 or so. 

And with that, I've sold myself on a return visit tomorrow."
"PA","This is basically as good as it gets for a pretzel shop and that's not a bad thing! This place has really taken a creative spin with soft pretzels..they offer all different kinds of flavors and sandwiches..I ordered a breakfast pretzel and it was alright..as a Philadelphia native, I think maybe I'm inclined to enjoy a pretzel by itself rather than topped with a mess of goodness. :) That's just me. Oh..this place was dirt cheap too..I gave her a $20 and got back like $16 and change for 2 pretzels and a sandwich..I was like wait..what? lol"
"PA","I felt like The Pretzel Shop and I were star-crossed lovers of some sort. Any time I was ever in the southside and found I was craving some salty-carb action it always seemed to be closed. I would shake my fist at the sky and wonder who wouldn't ever let me have delicious warm pretzely snacks.

Then on a chilly but clear Friday I was finally able to make a lunch dash! I grabbed two of the smaller bacon parm pretzels and luckily had some cash on me, as it's a cash only place. 

While on the salty side, they were DELICIOUS. They weren't warm but it was nothing a quick trip to a warm oven or the microwave wouldn't cure.

If you're in the southside around lunch time, and you want to grab a quick snack or meal make sure to stop here."
"PA","Four years after moving to NYC, this is one of two Pittsburgh spots I still yearn for daily.  (The other is Mad Mex.)  I've never tasted another soft pretzel that even comes close.  Dense, salty, doughy, just-barely-underbaked perfection."
"PA","What a gem. What a treasure. I don't think there are truly enough adjectives to describe this place. The Pretzel Shop is just one of those places you as a Pittsburgher need to go and try out and it's definitely a place for a tourist to visit as well.

Being located in the South Side I kind of feel that it gets masked by the 100's of bars which in a way makes it all the more better. It's one of those places that gets better each time you go. It's pretty small so it's easy to miss it but once you walk through those doors it's like your hit pretzel wonderland.

My personal favorite is the ham and cheese pretzel sandwich. A pretzel sandwich with real ham, not lunch meat ham, I'm talking Easter Sunday ham. I also love that they heat it up for you. If you're a turkey fan, they have those too. In addition to that they've got your traditional pretzel as well as many other flavors. You really have you pick of many delicious pretzel treats. 

If you happen to go soon, pick me up their veggie pizza on a pretzel. I've been dying to try it. Just make sure you take cash since they don't take credit/debit cards."
"PA","Again - this joint is great-  I love the Cheddar and jalapeno - for only 1 dollar it is as cheap as eats get.  You can get a full lunch for $3.25-  Like the fresh pretzel with parm as well as the plain-  not a fan of the cookie and other baked good but other seem to buy them."
"PA","I don't know if it was an off day or the time of day or what the issue was, but I didn't like these pretzels. I had been wanting to come by here for years and finally made it in. The amount of salt on these things was ridiculous. I like salt on pretzels, but this one had too much. After scraping off most of the salt, I went back to the pretzel. It was rubbery, cold, and difficult to get into manageable bites. Think of those microwave pretzels you get from Sam's or Costco. Now overheat one of those pretzels and put it in the refrigerator for an hour. THAT is what my five pretzels were like. I disposed of most of what I bought as inedible.

I am going to try one more time and stop in at opening time to see if that makes a difference."
"PA","The Pretzel Shop is one of those unique places that every city has. A wonderfully extra thick pretzel cut in half, slathered with sauce, and topped with your favorite pizza toppings, a pretzel pizza, screw the low carb diet!  Or, take the same pretzel, cut it in half and pile on turkey and cheddar, or ham and swiss, and you have a great sandwich with the extra crunch of salt from the pretzel top. What else do you need? Grab a sack full or a dozen or so pizza pretzels take them home, pop them in the oven and you have a great meal for the big game. I love this place!"
"PA","I have only had the pretzel stick, but it was really great! Reminded me of the Philly pretzels of my youth. Pretzel was dense and chewy and they have little packets of brown mustard. Fabulous. 

The pretzel ""sandwiches"" they offer look pretty atrocious, but maybe I'm just a pretzel purist."
"PA","Amazing! Don't waste your time with the sandwiches or pizza--all that stuff just gets in the way of the main event: the pretzel! Best pretzel in the city.  Best anything in the anywhere. Cheap, too. Only complaint: not open late enough."
"PA","If you haven't tried this place and call yourself a pretzel lover, then what the hell are you waiting for? 

It's a no frills mom & pop place, it's not gourmet so don't expect some fancy schmancy presentation - they are pretzels - delicious, chewy, salty pretzels. Plain and simple!"
"PA","Cheap, great food, family owned, wonderful employees.  The service is always with a smile.  The daily specials are great and they are conveniently located with extended business hours!"
"PA","The Pretzel Shop is a Pittsburgh classic.  I would give the quality of the pretzels 4 stars, but when you factor in the low cost, and quaint set-up- this place gets bumped up to 5 stars.  It's a great place to stop by for a pretzel sandwich on a Saturday, for a breakfast sandwich (any day but Sunday), or to get a ton of soft pretzels on the cheap if you have people coming over.  All in all, the Pretzel Shop is a must-go if you are in the South Side."
"PA","I came here for lunch and ate a pretzel sandwich.

A PRETZEL SANDWICH! 

Whoever came up with this idea is a genius. I didn't even know such a thing existed! 

Unfortunately the food did not live up to my expectations. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich which really wasn't bad, however the sandwiches are premade and I'm pretty sure the chicken was just a frozen patty.

Damn you pretzel sandwich you sounded so good!"
"PA","As Pittsburgh as Pittsburgh gets.

Not as cheap as it once was but I love these pretzel sandwiches.

Everyone should stop by and get at least a pretzel. You will love it.

Line can be a little long around lunch time but it moves fast.

I like the chicken salad pretzel the best.

Also get a cinnamon and sugar pretzel."
"PA","Time to add on more accolades to the Pretzel Shop. Their pretzels are wonderful. For one of the cheapest, tasty lunches around, pick up a pretzel sandwich then head over to a park bench on a nice day and chow down. 

A few caveats though - 
1) They tend to run out. They will reserve pretzels for you if you call in advance, though.
2) They close way too early. They should be open till at least 7pm - preferably midnight. I can't imagine the post-bar business they could do on Carson St. As it is, you'd better not get a pretzel craving after 3pm or you'll be out of luck.
3) They don't sell chips. If you're the type of person who thinks that sandwiches and chips are made for each other, take the time to stock up on chips elsewhere. As others have said, they have lots of other baked goods including rice krispie treats and seasonal cookies. Personally, I recommend a side of pretzels."
"PA","Ok. So you're in the mall (I'm sorry for you, really I am.) you smell that salty baked pretzel smell and suddenly you think going to Auntie Anne's is a good idea. You're wrong. Dead wrong.

Hold out for some Pretzel Shop love. The place is not only easy to find being right on East Carson Street in the Southside of Pittsburgh, but it has the absolute cheapest and FRESHEST pretzels ever. 

The downside, you can't sit down to eat inside and there is always a line. Honestly neither of these deter me as I am perfectly happy being a stoop-dweller and taking up someone else's front steps to eat one of these salty snacks. The line just tells me that it's worth it. 

The prices literally are rock bottom. Don't miss a chance to get something, even just to take home, from here. Delish."
"PA","If I had a weakness, it would be the Pretzel Shop.  I'm there all the time!  Even though the shop is tiny and you can't eat inside, there is always a line to get food.  Sandwiches are no more than $3.00 and they have great cookies, muffins and desserts.  Seriously, a couple of slices of meat and cheese between a sliced pretzel NEVER tasted so good."
"PA","This is one of my most favorite places in Pittsburgh.   I love pretzels and these are way better than the ones from the mall that are dripping in butter.  The pretzel sandwiches are less than $3 and a great lunch - not too much food.  I also like this place because it is one of the few place you can buy rice krispie treats.  This is just a great little neighborhood shop, that makes a great pretzel for an amazing price.  When they had to raise the price to $.50 they even posted a sign apologizing and explaining the price of the ingredients had gone up.  I definitely would put this on my list of places to eat in Pittsburgh."
"PA","After having had a terrible pretzel from the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia, we happened to park right in front of this shop when we were going to explore Carson Street. You walk in and there are just pretzels behind the counter, kind of like what we're used to seeing with bagel shops here on the West Coast. Each one was $.50. You can't beat it. We shared one since we were on an eating mission and it was a darn good pretzel. Lots of locals inside just grabbing pretzels here and there to go.

TY wanted to take some back to LA, so we asked how well they kept. We were told that you could take them back and throw them in the freezer, but since we were homeless, having checked out of the hotel already, we had to forgo any extras."
"PA","This is THE BEST place to eat in Pittsburgh.  I wish I could give this place 10 stars.  I love pretzels!  I love this place.  I love that they won't wait on you if you are talking on your cell phone.  I love that lunch is less than $3.
My second favorite food to pretzles is probably rice krispie treats - and they sell those too.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! I am adding some pictures of fresh pretzels!"
"PA","i'm not sure what i love about this place.  but every visit to pittsburgh seems to include a stop by this cheap take-out eatery on the southside.

its menu is simple:  pretzels.  you can get a bag of five hot, soft pretzels for $2.  however, the main attraction are its pretzel sandwiches.  the choices vary depending on the day, such as chicken salad, the club, buffalo chicken, tuna fish and more!  that said, the owner is sweet and made me a custom order of buffalo chicken once because of an undying craving.  the price varies based on whats in between the pretzels, but they all seem to be little more than $2.  yes, this place is CHEAP.

there's no where to sit down.. and there can be a line during prime lunch hours.  but if you love pretzels, this unique eatery is worth stopping by."
"PA","Jack's was my favorite bar in the South Side area of Pittsburgh. I could have stayed there all night."
"PA","I visited Jack's on a particularly busy night. It was shoulder to shoulder everywhere on the Southside that night, which definitely made a difference in the experience. I'll try to keep this in mind when I review Jack's.

Jack's has an interesting look. Its a nice little bar with hand written signs on the walls- not cluttered but getting crowded. It's gimmicky but not tacky, which is a hard balance to find. Their drink prices are untouchable, they are seriously sooooooo cheap. Pitchers of shots are like $12. It's ridiculous. We stayed here for about an hour before moving on. I think the smoke and the fact that the pool tables were covered up were the only complaints I noted. All things considered, Jack's is a great place to start the night. On a less crowded night, I can see myself enjoying it a lot more."
"PA","You can't get any divier that Jack's. This is the low of the low, the dregs of the Burgh, the armpit of the city, the thorn of Carson ST, and the black eye of the South Side. It's so bad you have to love it. Open 365 days a year (yes, they are even open Christmas Day) this is a bar you can get falling down, pee on a cop car drunk for under 10 bucks. Don't EVEN ask for a fancy shmancy drink here, odds are they won't know how to make it. This is your atypical steel city shot and a beer bar, enter at your own risk, you have been warned."
"PA","A well crafted hole in the wall, it's a average joes type of place, but Bunny the babe bartender we will make you felt right at home."
"PA","Cool spot.been here forever...even before south side was the cool place to be"
"PA","I loved this bar!! I'm from California and was amazed at pittsburgh's nightlife. Awesome cheap alcohol. Will come here again if I'm ever in Pittsburgh in the future!"
"PA","Cool side room with an additional bar. A good place in the Southside to just have a drink with some friends."
"PA","How can you go wrong?  Maybe the perfect dive bar.  Loud music, cheap beer and friendly people.  I got drunk at this place twice and both times I had a blast.  If you go to Pittsburgh, this is the bar to visit if your into dive bars.  

Thanks"
"PA","This place made me love Pittsburgh. CHEAP food and beer. Nothing fancy, just a fryer behind the bar. Normal bar fare, but fresh and tasty. 

Nice bartenders helping us find stuff to do in Pitt (we found, we stayed at Jack's). 

Beer specials and mixed drinks were good as well. A perfect dive!"
"PA","Awsome place  drink. It has a nice atmosphere, affordable drinks and nice staff. It s a must to stop at while in the flats."
"PA","I'm in Pittsburgh. I'm not a Steeler fan but here for the Bengal game (totally not a Bengal fan either). We're here for shenanigans and debauchery. Totally looking for a dive bar. 

My search has ended. This place is absolutely fabulous. Cheap drinks. Stiff drinks. Fantastic attitudes, both by the patrons and by the staff. This place, as a previous reviewer had noted, defines dive bar. Who else serves pitchers of shots. Yes, pitchers of shots. That is exactly how it sounds. 

I think we walked the whole south side strip, and went to a dozen or more bars that night, but ended up here three times. I don't know why we left, only to think the rest of Pittsburgh would be just as fab. This is our go to place. Thank you Jack's for being there in our time of need."
"PA","I can't believe this place only has 14 reviews.  Jack's defines ""Pittsburgh Dive Bar.""  For reals.  

Open at 7am.  Serves food.  Smoking allowed.  Reasonable prices.  Awesome jukebox.  What more do you need?  If only it weren't in the South Side.  Then again, I guess that's part of it's charm."
"PA","This is one of the most entertaining dive bars I've been to, but for a different reason than many of the others I've gone to. Typically, I go to be entertained by the wildlife that attends the bar. However, they have several entertaining pictures around the bar that show the bars funny philosophies, rules, and even their menu. In addition, they have some props in the bar that make for some good photo opportunities.

Drink selection is typically from local breweries with larger scale production or from America's mass production breweries. Simple well drinks are also available here along with straight shots.

This is a cash only business, so bring money. If you forgot money, there is an ATM on property for you to withdraw some cash for your beverages.

This place is a smoking establishment and they are open every legal minute of the year 7am-2am daily except Sundays when they are open 11am-2am."
"PA","Jack's is Jack's. Great drink prices - large mixed drinks - pitchers of shots - lots of smoke. You sneak past a refrigerator to go into the back room. 
Jack's is the nightcap to a night of drinking on the South Side. But they also serve holiday dinners on Thanksgiving and Christmas to whomever walks in. 
Everybody goes to Jack's. There is no dress code or snootiness. Though they do have a bouncer carding on Friday and Saturday nights, he's mainly there to keep the peace. This is a classic Pittsburgh establishment where you can see all walks of life morning or night. Don't miss Jack's on your South Side bar crawl (though with all the neon lights you'd have to be trying to actually miss it.)"
"PA","Got here before the crowds on Bourbon....err I mean Carson St. started to roll in.  It's a much different atmosphere when there isn't the rowdiness of the college/young adult crowd in there.  You can actually sit and enjoy a libation and talk amongst yourselves.

Drink are definitely reasonably priced, which is great for a place that has so much competition.

Half the time I was distracted by all the kick ass signs hanging on the walls/ceiling.

Be sure to put your nose where it says for an amazing view."
"PA","If you are looking for a dive bar in Pitt, you can't beat it. Anyone who is complaining about this place simply doesn't like this type of bar. But if you do, it can't be beat. Highly recommended"
"PA","Can't beat Jack's.  You just can't.  It may be the best dive bar in Pitt.  And I say that in the very best way possible.  Def Leopard and darts, with cheap beer and bartenders that were born there (that does not mean they are old either).  You either get Jack's or you don't and if you don't you are really missing out.  Some Southside full-timers may be put off by Jack's popularity, but don't listen to them, it's popular for a reason, it's fun.

There is nothing fancy or pretentious about this bar, so if you look like you just fell out of an L.L. Bean or Talbot's catalog, you need not enter.  The bar has two sides, both of which can pack em in like sardines on weekends.  If you are barhopping on the Southside, start your night at Jack's to get off to a fun and wallet friendly start.  To impress your out-of-town friends, order up some Jack's exclusive Pumpkin Pie shots, you won't be disappointed, the preparation is as much fun as drinking the actual shot.

Jack's is Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh is Jack's, warts and all.  It's not fancy or built for times square, but that's the point.  Jack's might be a little rough around the edges, but it has personality and will win you over in spite of yourself.  Go in with the right expectations and you will leave happy."
"PA","Waited for a crappy bartender to wait on me on a very uncrowded night.  I guess he was texting someone to find more stupid ass white rim glasses.  Still tipped him.  This place has taken a turn downhill, possibly? Shame jack's, for shame!   Lol!"
"PA","Thank goodness for Jack's.  As an outsider, I wasn't sure if I would be able to find a bar I felt comfortable in after one night, but Jack's proved to be the spot.  Both beer and shots were super cheap.  There was a flow of people in and out, but even at its most busiest, I didn't feel like I was being pushed around.  The locals were nice enough, or drunk enough.  You have to love a bartender who wears a Jenna Jameson shirt.  The mix of people in the bar was definitely all over the place.  I was in Pittsburgh one night and I met a real steel worker (yes, in the flesh).  Even at the end of the night when the girls room had puke on the floor, I didn't mind.  It almost made sense to me.

If I ever come back to this part of Pittsburgh, I will definitely get my drinks at Jacks."
"PA","2.5 rounding up because of the free popcorn on the bar!!

WOW! What a mix. This bar is hit or miss, the crowd varies night to night. I generally stay away from south side bars unless a friend wants to meet up and for some reason my bff loves this place...maybe its the free popcorn or the fact that cotton eyed joe is always played when we're there...coincidence? I think not."
"PA","This is the perfect dive bar! They have $1 sloppy joes, great priced drinks & you have to try the pumpkin pie shots...UNBELIEVABLE!!! It is smoke filled with very unusual characters. There were Steelers fans, anarchist and regular joes...a diverse crowd for sure! LOVED IT! They don't take any crap off anyone. I saw the bartender kick out 2 people who were way wasted and being rude...so be nice, but have FUN!"
"PA","Wonderful dive into the south side of Pittsburg. Two drinking, er, seating sections. Two pool tables and a Galaga machine. Score."
"PA","Jack's is great! Its the kind of dive bar that is open really early in the morning and is filled with old vets and people coming off of night shifts but is super packed on a Friday night. 

They are reasonably priced, have strong drinks and a little bit of bar food, but nothing spectacular. 

There are two rooms, the back room has pool tables and maybe some darts, but I dont remember. Each room has a separate bar and juke boxes. 

Parking in the southside is a pain in the ass, so, if at all possible - get a taxi! Its laid back, no dress code and a good place to go watch a game."
"PA","i could see why this is a great & popular dive bar, but unfortunately for me and the crew, the bar was too crowded to make our way to order a drink. Also, too smokey to see across. Otherwise, on a slow night, i bet this place would be pretty rad."
"PA","This is a pretty unique dive bar and a pittsburgh original.  I don't go there much now, but I did have the occassion recently to be there at around  830am on a Saturday.  I couldn't believe how many people were there and the mix of the crowd.  There were people there my age who  had obviously had a long night that turned into an early morning.  There were also ""grinders"" who just got done working at the mill or whatever and were there to have a cold meatloaf sandwich and a beer for breakfast.  There was also a guy there who was trying to sell me a pair of his shoes.  There can be a lot of meatheads there sometimes late at night, but if you are looking for a good dive bar open 365 days a year I suggest Jack's Rose Bar, especially before 9 AM."
