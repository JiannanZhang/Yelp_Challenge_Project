"NC","I would give Carolina Auto Repair no stars if possible. 
I took my car here for a simple oil change. When I picked my car up and started to drive home my hood flew open and broke my windshield also destroyed my hood.
John (the owner) refused to pay for the damages even though it was clearly his fault. He was very disrespectful to my father and I while lying about who actually did the work on my car.
We are now going to sue him for damages."
"NC","I've taken my car here several times now, only for my yearly inspections, but they always get me in and out quickly. It's been the same folks every time i've been there. They are super friendly and seem to be trustworthy and reliable. It's the kind of place where people keep coming back. 

It's a small building, i think just the 2 car garage. Not even sure of the range of services offered, but if it's not something he can fix, he'll let you know without faking it and charging you for something unnecessarily (saw him check under a guy's hood while i was waiting and tell him where to take he needed to take it)."
"NC","John (owner) is someone I trust my families safety to.  I know that when he tells me something, it is the truth.  He is good at what he does and does not charge you a fortune to fix it. He has inspected a problem with my car and told me to take it to a specialist to get it fixed.  John is a good chirstian man and he will NOT do you wrong."
"NC","The eggplant Parmesan is FABULOUS!   My friend always has the pizza and says it is really good.  Service is friendly.  Its clean.  Local place that I will continue to come back to again and again!"
"NC","Don't waste your time or money.  My salad had a rotten tomato and a hair (not mine).  My waitress never offered another hairless salad even if I had wanted one.  The broiled flounder wasn't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies.  Both were SO BLAND I could have prepared a better version at home.  My mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre.  The owner asked how our meal was when I paid and insisted they use fresh tomatoes.  I'm sure they do but I had to spit mine out.  She discounted our drinks but I'll never be back!"
"NC","Tasty food, good pizza and reasonable prices for a non-chain small business.  I've always done take out but when picking up have noticed the interior is probably exactly the same as when it opened many decades ago.  I guess that adds charm for some and is a detractor to others.  Nonetheless, I'm happy to see a small business still in business and will continue to order from them"
"NC","the food is really good and homemade. pizza really good, owner makes incredible homemade desserts, friendly staff.  nice non-chain restaurant"
"NC","All I wanted was a quick burger to take out, and I never got to even order. Sunday night at 7 PM shouldn't be peak dining time, but the drive thru line was 10 cars long. So in to the lobby I went, and waited in line inside rather than out. I waited, and waited, then waited a little more. After 5 minutes without getting closer to the register, I gave up. That was enough for me. In the end, I probably added a year to my life skipping my order anyway."
"NC","I have been to this location maybe 10 times in the past few years and every time I go through the drive through the order is wrong. No fries, no salad dressing with salad, no fork, and the last straw was at the bottom of my chili bowl it was about a 6in piece of paper. Avoid!!"
"NC","3x. So far so good."
"NC","Worst wendy's I have ever been to in my travels all over the USA. Normally Wendy's is at the top of my fast food list. This particular location is HORRIBLE. AVOID !!!"
"NC","I love Wendy's in NC they have the Carolina Classic sandwich"
"NC","This is a Pizza Hut/Wing Street. i hate to review chains unless something really stands out, but i figure there should be at least one review saying it's not a shit hole. 

Pizza Hut is an old family favorite, surprisingly for their spaghetti, so with my mom in town we tried the local Belmont location. Some locations have different bread sticks then i am used to, but this one had the delicious, garlic covered ones. Spaghetti with meat sauce was good as expected with excellent garlic bread. 

It seems like a smaller dining room, i'm not sure what was around the one wall, may have been more seating. Service was friendly enough, no complaints."
"NC","Came to pick up 12 pizzas for an event. Staff welcomed me and made small talk while we waited. Pizzas were hot and fresh and the place was immaculately clean. Good specials too."
"NC","Smells

Good service, good food but the place smells like an old, musty motel room. I'm local and have been there several times and it always smells. There's almost a ""needs cleaning"" public bathroom tinge to it as well. 

You'll know; stop where the little foyer ends about 15' inside the front door and inhale through your nose.

It's an old place so it's time for renovation or replacement."
"NC","I get take-out from here occasionally, purely out of convenience and lack of competition.  During my last pick-up, the evening of 6-22-12, I witnessed a patron quietly complaining about the confusion and lack of separation between those waiting to pay, waiting for an order, and waiting to be seated.  The front waiting area was in mass confusion.  The response from the manager on duty was to insult the patron, saying ""grown men should be able to wait on pizza, and basically, I don't care"".  This is not an acceptable response for management.  
The quality of our pizza is mediocre at best, with the toppings being more than 2 inches from the edge on a hand tossed pizza.  The lady at the register was friendly as usual.
This Pizza Hut is not a top choice, but ok in a pinch."
"NC","Simple, cheap. This place probably hasn't changed for decades. 

There really isn't a formal menu..just a list of what they offer on the wall. Your waitress will tell you what everything costs, but it's so reasonable..just order what you want.

I usually get the two egg breakfast: eggs made to order, grits, toast-or-biscuit and a meat. Plus coffee. And it's only $4.50! 

Note - they only take cash and close around 1:30 pm"
"NC","Best breakfast in Belmont....love love love the White's"
"NC","Greasy spoon in Belmont! Quick, cheap, and tasty :)  The type of place with loyal regulars.  Great country ham and eggs.  No muss, no fuss, just how a breakfast spot like this should be!"
"NC","This ratings is more for the employee's they have bagging the groceries at this location. 

I love the deals this Bi-Lo has to offer. That's why I shop here. I spend a lot of time planning my grocery trips, clipping coupons and checking out the circular. When I get to the store I spend the same amount of time picking out my groceries. When I get to the check-out the last thing I want to happen to my carefully picked groceries is to have them thrown into bags, crushed, bruised, and meat packaging punctured due to poor bagging. When I left the store today my tomatoes were at the bottom of a bag with boxed goods packed on top of them, same with my hamburger meat. My bread was crammed into a bag along with canned goods and all other canned goods/jars of food were packed in single plastic bags, filled to the max. Needless to say, carrying my groceries into my home was a bit of a gamble, as two of my bags handles ripped, and another that was crammed full of boxed groceries ripped down the side. As much as I love the deals and the convenience of this location, I don't think I will continue shopping here if the service doesn't improve. I would rather pay a little more for my groceries than have things ruined and damaged due to poor workmanship."
"NC","Convenience is always important"
"NC","I live about 5 minutes from Belmont, thus I do most of my shopping there as opposed to heading into the city itself (and lets face it, going down Wilkinson toward uptown isn't exactly the best place to shop!).  I mix up my groceries between Harris Teeter, Walmart, and Bi-Lo.  This Bi-Lo in particular usually has a lot of helpful folks, it's very conveniently located and is open all the time.  I prefer the deli here over Walmart lets say and you can usually get a lot of items on sale that are cheaper than Walmart as well - but not a lot of the stuff that isn't on sale.  If you are looking for a grocery store in and around Belmont, this is probably the best place to go."
"NC","The oysters and scallops where good but not $17 good.  This place is way over priced. If you come here be sure to check the prices before you order and ask if it's extra if you add scallops to to your meal.   Fired oysters and scallops over $17 here.  This will be the last time I come here."
"NC","Good seafood and decent prices. If you want fancy food, this isn't the place for you. If you want alcohol with your meal go elsewhere as well. However, if you want good fish/shrimp at a good price served quickly and efficiently - this is your place. You can get fried, broiled or boiled (shrimp)."
"NC","I have been going to this restaraunt for years. The service is great but the food is subpar at best. The salad bar has fake cheese and imitation bacon bits. The fish is ok, sometimes a little overcooked. My husband is a fan of the green shrimp. The hushpuppies however are delicious!"
"NC","This location is closer to home than the original on Linwood Road and I really like the food here.  The staff is very friendly and I love the fact you get a salad with your meal.  I love the oysters, Canadian skinless flounder and the marinated beef strips - those are some of my favorites.  Their tartar sauce is excellent and yes you get to squirt it out of the container versus paying for individual cups like some places.  If you love seafood like I do give it a try.  Remember .....  good seafood isn't cheap and cheap seafood isn't good!"
"NC","Always had great food, Try the clam chowder!!!"
"NC","My wife got food poisoning from here. AVOID AT ALL COSTS....."
"NC","Went to Captains Cap quite by accident, Monday night and the place we were heading to was closed... Drove out from Charlotte, hmmm this one is OPEN, so it gets a star for just being there!  We were after ""fish camp"" food, especially fried catfish.  captain cap does it the way my husband likes it.. Several small fried catfish, actually six on the senior plate... That's a lot of food!
Salad is saved by the fantastic sour slaw.. Waitress said go ahead and get seconds, and I did!
Broiled shrimp is pretty good, not fantastic, but lots of it... The sweet potato was somehow the sweetest baked sweet potato I've ever had...
Overall, good traditional fish camp food, and friendly service, and open on Monday night!"
"NC","Took my Mom here today for a post Mother's day lunch. It's been about a year since our last visit. Salad bar is a one trip deal only and the salad plates are smaller than I remember last time. Hushpuppies are 2 bite sized and are very good with the right amount of sweetness and onion. My Mom got the senior flounder plate and I got one of the specials which was salt and pepper catfish fillets. Both included a side and the one trip to the salad bar.
Food was good, but both our flounder and catfish were on the thin side and not very meaty. Service was very friendly and attentive.
Lunch set me back $23 with drinks tax and tip which I thought was really pricey for lunch especially with the thin pieces of fish and considering my Mom ordered off of the senior menu and I got one of the specials."
"NC","Captain's Cap is a traditional southern Fish Camp.   There is a broiled section on the menu, but few folks order broiled that frequent this restaurant.   The seafood is fried and it is delicious.  The salad bar is good and there is a decent selection.  Most of the clientele are 65+ and most of the decor hasn't changed since Carter was in office."
"NC","2 stars?  3 stars?
Okay 3.
I didn't get sick and the food was hot and they were nice - that qualifies, right?
Think 1974 and you're just about right; the salad bar is iceberg lettuce and you're warned to not go more than once.
Avocado and harvest gold is everywhere.
'Captain' is begging to be spelled ""Cap'n"".
Okay, no more snarky comments; it is what it is.  Lots of older folks and you're in the middle of small town America.  The food is pretty insipid, but none of us got sick.
The hushpuppies WERE pretty darn good."
"NC","This is a very family-friendly, casual seafood restaurant with nice portions and great prices.  They serve both fried and broiled seafood, as well as steak and chicken. I had the broiled salmon with the baked sweet potato and salad bar.  I also tried a vinegar-based cole slaw (think similar to cold sauerkraut) from the salad bar and it was great. The service was friendly, quick, and efficient."
"NC","Great locally owned BBQ joint.   Large portions and great service.    Large selection of old fashioned bottles beverages such as Grape Nehi. Orange Nehi, sundrop, the glass bottle kind.  
Not sure about the 1 star rating someone left about breakfast?  I mean, seriously, you came to a BBQ joint for breakfast?"
"NC","Very good BBQ, and AMAZING onion rings!!!   We are headed there again tonight for our second trip in the past three weeks."
"NC","Had breakfast here one time and it was very primitive. Coffee was really bad.  I took one drink and trashed it.   Have been told they survive on the burgers.  Will have to try one and update but breakfast is a Not Recommend."
"NC","They claim to have some of the best burgers in town and surprisingly it was actually a pretty good burger. i ordered the cheeseburger with chili (i was told chili made in house) and mustard combo that comes with fries and a drink for like $6. The fries were blah crinkle cut fries which were fine and the ice for the drink cup came from a cooler of ice on the counter which seemed odd. 

It's kind of a dingy space next door to an independent pharmacy that they've attempted to give some life with a mural on one wall and some local Belmont stuff on another wall. 

Overall, i was a satisfied customer."
"NC","Astonished!  Been eating their delivered pizzas for 8 yrs, Good pies~ but this time they made a mistake and wrote down pick up.  Hour later I called, got brash woman (owner!) Who told me it was my mistake~  I asked if they would deliver, but hoped for a fresh pie~  whoa  - absolutely not!  
When I asked how we could compromise,  she said she was deleting the order. Well ok I guess.
I even called back to speak with manager (that's how I figured out she was owner)  and she absolutely didn't care about my 8 yrs of loyalty.

Sad for them, she probably wonders why her little junky restaurant is not very successful~  and I'll tell a hundred Mt holly people about it because communities don't support business owners who do this ~ all of this over a 12 dollar pizza, pretty pathetic huh?
Kelly.  Mt Holly, NC"
"NC","I have been eating here since I was a little girl, and it is always the same!  It is friendly, simple, and delicious!  The sub bread is so good and the crinkle fries are awesome too.  Don't expect fancy, but do expect a good lunch."
"NC","food was okay but the place is filthy. Tables were dirty. Dead flies in window seals. Window blinds have food residue splattered on them.  Ceiling fans have dust caked on them. Gross..."
"NC","I came in here with my neighbor! I ordered the steak and cheese and he ordered the meatball sub. Not only was our order fast, it was SO good. The elderly woman was as sweet as could be & the young man that brought us our food was cheerful. I love the Celtic photos on the wall, and the amount of people that draw on the wooden seats provide a homey, childhood-esque feel to the place. 

Good food, good service & good atmosphere. You can't go wrong."
"NC","really wanted a sub. and saw this place driving by on a road trip. thought I would support small business at the same time. but they don't even seem to have SUBS. The food was horrible- I think they served me fries from the day before and they weren't even reheated.  The staff was rediculously unfriendly... it's like the 70s down here still ;-/
Wish I got the WO memo on this place and not wasted my money, just threw that food in the trash, didn't even want my dog to eat it."
"NC","Wanted something close and my husband suggested Sub Corral so we gave it another shot.  I called in the order and the man/boy that took the order was not friendly at all no thank you just a ""give me 20 minutes"" and hung up.   The food was AWFUL.  I got the meatball sub and it was nasty (unedible) and the pizza was not good.  I will never go again.  I used to drive 20 minutes to get this pizza but now living in Belmont I will not even drive 5 minutes for it.  So dissapointing."
"NC","Used to be my favorite pizza and sub shop but has really gone down hill the past year or so.  Many have mentioned how their recent visits have been dissapointing."
"NC","I gave four stars because the place was clean, food was good, and service was fast. The guy that took my order wasn't overly friendly, but he wasn't rude either. As for the food I judge a sandwich for the bread as much as anything, and the bread here is great - I got wheat. My sandwich was overstuffed, making it very hard to eat. The fries are crinkle cut and we're fantastic. I ate in, which afforded me unlimited self service refills. There is no table service here. Parking was easy and plentiful, just approach from the east ( coming from Charlotte ) because there is no access from the other way - you'll have to do a U-turn."
"NC","This time i dined in. 
They have a big menu on the wall and when i finally made up my mind, placed my order. Staff wasn't rude, but didn't give me that thanks for coming feeling. 

Wasn't too thrilled with my choice this time, i thought it was the same thing i ordered last time, which i still can't remember the name...hot sandwich, beef, mushrooms, etc. i don't think i'll get that again, but i'm convinced that i will find something i really like there. The food never thrills me but entices me enough to try again. Fries were good with ketchup as predicted. 

Highlight: there is a picture of Macho Man Randy Savage on the wall around the corner."
"NC","i haven't stepped foot inside yet, but we picked up some food last week. The warm sandwich i got was pretty good (a greasy goodness) and the fries were just plain regular crinkle fries which would have been fine had we been given ketchup. 

i was satisfied enough to want to try it again sometime"
"NC","I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, but I love bowling & it'd be nice not to have to travel to Gastonia or Charlotte to bowl. There must be a reason this place is always empty... even with its dirt cheap prices. With that said, I went once a few years ago and vowed never to go back. 

The floors are so oily, I slipped or fell on my walk up every single time!!! I wasn't able to find the 6 lb. ball within the already limited selection. Food is limited and all fried, that's not a good thing either. I couldn't wait to leave, I remember thinking: this place is trying to kill me.

Please just increase your prices and invest in some upgrades."
"NC","Have been here on 2 different occasions with my family. Both times I was disappointed. 
A bowling alley should be a fun atmosphere. There was nothing, no music playing so I went to the desk & asked if they could play some music. The guy said yea. 
Now mind you, there was nobody  waiting to pay, check in. Not busy at all. 

15 long minutes later I hear some soft sounds. After another 5 minutes hoping they'd turn it up, I go to the desk AGAIN & ask if they could turn it up so we could hear it over the sounds of bowling. 
The guy looked like it irritated him but agreed. The place sounded like a morgue! 
It's just not a place I associate with fun at all which is NOT what it should be. 

The balls kept hanging up in our 2nd visit which was rather irritating bc it was one after the other. Finally they changed our lane but NO REAL give two hoots  customer service. I WILL NOT SEE IF THE 3rd TIME IS THE CHARM. 
The food is better than the customer service, although when a lil busy it's very unorganized & long wait for even sodas."
"NC","This review is for the Grill Restaurant.

Step back twenty years (maybe thirty?) To the pharmacy fountain diner, where the food I'd pure comfort and totally cheap! Watch for daily specials and enjoy the nostalgic lunch experience. Recommend everything and don't forget to feed the tip jar!"
"NC","Cheap bowling, clean, serves food, & has pool tables. What else could you ask for in a bowling alley?"
"NC","From first glance, and not being from Belmont, the pharmacy/grill/bowling alley combo in one building appears somewhat odd.  And I suppose it is.

We met up with a group for a couple of games and some snacks from the grill and the atmosphere is family friendly, clean and although somewhat dated, still a fun place to hang out.  There is a pool area adjacent to the lanes and while we were there on a Wednesday night, there was a decent crowd milling about.

The grill fare is what you'd expect - chicken tenders/onion rings and fries were on our platter of choice...nothing special, but definitely doable for snacks while you bowl.

Having not bowled in about 10 years, I survived the games and won't soon be asked to join any bowling leagues, but would go back if invited and would recommend for a local or someone like me just there for the night."
"NC","Not a bad little bowling alley.  They have probably around 15 lanes but the place has never been crowded when we're there (which I enjoy).  The lanes are in good condition.  While the scoring system is old, the monitors hanging from the ceiling that display the score are all new.  The games were reasonably priced, especially after checking into prices at the epicenter bowling alley which were outrageous.  There's a cute little diner in the bowling alley that I always want to try but we've never ordered food here.  There's nothing too special about this place but if you're looking to bowl in the Belmont area this is the place I'd recommend (unless you want to get your drink on in which case you'll need to go somewhere else, no alcohol sold here)."
"NC","After living in the area for about 8 months, I finally looked into this place. We never even knew it was a bowling alley!! I thought it was a tile store or something that I wouldn't care about.

Reasonably priced at $2.50/game before 6pm and $3.50 after 6.

The big bummer about this place for those of us accustomed to a pitcher of beer while you bowl was no bar!  I let that go because it has a nice little diner/grill connected to it.

Don't come here expecting fancy new scoring machines or ball returns. But it has an authentic, classic bowling alley feel with an arcade and pool tables that sort of resemble something at a Boys and Girls club. 

Overall, a nice local joint to remind me how frustrating bowling makes me."
"NC","This has to be the worst company in the world..how are they still in business..customer services like Dealing with a zoo.. Nobody takes responsibility for anything.. Please therefore  do not ship any package USPO.. And why as a public are we worrying about them privatising the mail.. Remember public word-of-mouth is everything I was I would have known about the services before hand .. Now I know & will be speeding  the world to everyone I know. To avoid using the post office by all means.. Pay your bills online they offer fee money orders @ some money cash place. I hope this help someone before it's two late for them"
"NC","My biggest complaint deals with packages coming into the facility from private carriers like FedEx. If you've ordered a package and this happens, expect to wait about a week for them to deliver the package. Two day shipping turns into a week and a half. 

Long, long wait in lines. No concern for your packages. Terrible delivery - drivers have crammed packages into my box causing damage. If you can afford to, go with UPS."
"NC","Just your typical small town post office. Service is always pretty quick & the lines aren't entirely too long. They have all your mailing needs along with post office boxes as well. So nothing special, just your typical post office."
"NC","This place is pretty good at getting the orders out quickly and most importantly getting everything you order in the bag. I did get the splats after eating here the last time but I can't be 100% sure it was from this food here, but it doesn't matter I will still keep going."
"NC","You can definitely tell management has been  making efforts to improve this franchise. The staff are mostly friendly and prompt. The tacos are filled to the edge with ingredients, and the line moves pretty quickly now. Sometimes they leave an item out of my order or give me unsweet tea instead of sweet, which is the worst, but most of the time everything is great."
"NC","I know its a chain, I also know its not authenic Mexican food, but every now and again I get a Taco Bell craving I just have to satisfy!
Plus if you make some wise menu choices, you can eat good without ingesting a whole lot of fat grams. For example, I get 2 steak soft tacos fresco style which is pico de gallo instead of cheese and sour cream. The pico is very good and you can taste the fresh cilantro. This drops the fats grams to only 4 each. Add a side of rice (only 3 fat grams)  cover in fire sauce and add an unsweet tea or diet coke and you eatin' good for only 11 grams of fat! Pretty good from a fast food joint, huh? I also get a side of guacamole that really good, but I don't count it as it has it has all the good kinds of fats that are good for you! A win win situation.
I aslo thinks its pretty damn tasty! Thats right, I said it, I LIKE TACO BELL!!
Plus most locations I have been in are clean and the counter service is friendly.
I don't eat here once a week or even once a month, but when the craving does hit, I'm  thinking outside the box and making a run for the border!"
"NC","Easy in, easy out. Taco Bell is probably one of the easiest to eat and drive. As long as you dig into the burrito just right, it's not going to spill all over you while you're piloting a two ton missile down the highway at 115 feet per second.

I pulled into this TB at 1AM and wasn't paying a whole lot of attention. There's apparently a script. She said ""Can you confirm your order on the screen"" and I just kept saying ""No, that's my complete order"" because I was busy checking in on Yelp and not paying attention. I'm sure that she was halfway to calling the cops and reporting a DUI as I drove off with my ""fourth meal."""
"NC","Most fast food places fall in the the meh category for me. They get the job done but sometimes they are slow or the bathroom is rank or the fries are soggy or something. 

This McDonald's is by far the worst fast food experience I've ever had. They had about 3-5 employees working at around 12 am on a Saturday night. There were about 15 of us in line and it took over an hour to get our food...... An hour for ""fast"" food. I could have went into an ihop and had two sit down meals during that time frame and filled up gas. 

The employees did not seem to care and had no sense to work faster. Didn't feel like they spoke English well and an overall sense of indifference towards the customers. I would avoid this McDonald's at all costs, a below mediocre McDonald's with probably terrible management allowing the employees to be so apathetic and worried only about getting their hours in. 

AVOID!!"
"NC","Worst McDonalds in the United States of America. I could get food faster in a prison cell. You have a better chance of the Pope going to hell than getting good service here."
"NC","Having people that don't speak English very well taking orders in the drive thru is a recipe for failure.  I always try to double check but feel rushed because of the amount of people behind me. My order is right 50% of the time."
"NC","This is the very best McDonalds that I have ever been to. It is always kept spotless on the inside, and the outside is always well landscaped. This McDonalds has won the town's ""Yard of the month"" award on numerous occasions. The drive thru is the fastest you will find for any fast food restaurant, and I've always received my order accurately and fast."
"NC","12/11    Most unreliable WiFi in town. The manager will look you straight in the eye and lie to you about a cut antenna but I've tested with multiple devices and times/dates and know this isn't true.

1/12     STILL the most unreliable WiFi in town! Does zero good to complain. Obvious they could care less."
"NC","I'm a big fan of mc d's but I was expecting more when I saw pork chop biscuit what a fail."
"NC","I appreciate how clean it is here and that's probably because they have a lot of employees. Despite all of help, I still waited so long for an iced mocha that I ate all of my fries while standing at the cash register.

Kudos to major employers in small, rural areas!"
"NC","Shooters express is my local gun range. The range staff is knowledgeable and willing to help if you have a malfunction or an issue. 
I like that they have monthly range packages available. Instead of only charging by the hour for about $40 a month you can go and shoot as much as you want with free range time so I have to pay for targets.  You have to bring your own ammunition of course or buy theirs.  
Their pro shop staff is honest about the quality of the firearms I tell them what I'm planing on using it for, self-defense, hunting small game and they trying to recommend something that might be useful to me even if it is less expensive than the item I was looking at at first."
"NC","I have no other ranges to compare this to but my experience for the pro shop and range has been decent. Pro shop is priced a tad bit above your chain retail stores BUT you get deals such as a free basic handling class that includes shooting time and a 30 day range pass. I thought the staff I dealt with was courteous and went above and beyond to answer all questions I had (and talk to my very talkative grandfather too!) now...on to the range! If it's winter, and you're cold natured, dress warm!! It's freezing when it's cold! Lanes are OK and there are fees if you bring your own ammo but it's all laid out on the website. Everyone I dealt with working on the range side was good too. Now, could things be better on all sides and aspects? Yes. But average for me."
"NC","I was worried when I saw some of the reviews but we (my son and I) had a pleasant if not cold time.  They couldn't turn off the blower, which was indeed too much right on us.  With the weather, around 35deg it was very chilly.  

The staff was friendly (at worst, curt - but expected in this environment... never rude!).  We shot quite a few guns (1 pistol, 2 revolvers, a rifle and a fully automatic PDW [UMP-40].). You do have to buy a box of ammo at a time, but you can use them in different guns (membership grants free use).  

Sure, the range is small and could use updating but to fire an automatic, there's little competition."
"NC","We (Europeans) went here to try some guns and rifles. We signed for a one month range membership für $50 which included a free choice of the rental semi-automatics (about 25 different or something), security glasses, earplugs and the range time! All we had to pay were the ammo (about $18 for 50 bullets) and the targets ($1 oder $2 or something). Full automatic like the MP5 came with additional $35. But it was worth it ;-)
The staff was very nice and took its time to answer als (handling) questions!
Only star deduction is for the circumstance, that the ranges are very old.

If you want to try different guns! Big recommendation!"
"NC","Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Will definitely be spending some time over there both in the shop and at the range"
"NC","Eek... avoid! We walked into Shooters Express Gun Shop looking to pop off a few rounds. The range is in the back of the shop, ensuring that you walk through the retail portion. There are two separate ranges, one for rifles/shotguns and one for handguns. 

We checked in with the range master and he asked if it we had safety cards. We didn't, as this was our first visit. He handed us a business card sized safety card and told us to fill in the info (name & birthday). That was it. I'm not sure what video the others are referring to, as we didn't watch it. 

The range itself had terrible ventilation. No air conditioning/cooling just a fan that didn't oscillate. Sweating at the lanes while trying to hold a loaded gun. No bueno. The lighting was poor. 

My biggest complaint is pricing. $18 per hour per PERSON... with an one hour minimum. Most indoor ranges charge by lane, not person. Plus... they charge for targets... Customer service was poor and unfriendly. $40 for two people to shoot for less than 30 minutes (we brought our own guns & ammo, otherwise that figure would be way higher). 

The bathroom was gross. With how much money they are making at the range, you would figure they could at least spruce up the bathroom a bit. I've been to a fair share of indoor shooting ranges across the country and this was by far the least impressive!"
"NC","Great place to shoot a rifle or gun.  Pro shop is small, but staff is knowledgeable and friendly. They also offer specials on gun packages that other places do not offer, but you have to visit to see what is on special as they are not advertised.

Offer gun range memberships which can be more economical than the hourly rates for those who shoot at least once a month.  Membership includes free gun rental which allows the customer to 'try out' a variety of guns before making any purchase.  AMMO is expensive everywhere, and that is not an exception here.  $30 for one box of 9mm range ammo, but much cheaper for 22 ammo.  Ammo availability has not been an issue here.

Classes are offered for guns and women's self defense(no gun).  A great service to the public.

There is only one restroom and it is not nice.  Bring a toilet cover and your own wipes."
"NC","I have used the range at Shooters before but never bought anything in their Pro Shop until last week.  This review will cover both the range and the shop. 


The Shop:

For the last year or so, I have been getting updates from Shooters on my Facebook page and usually they are for something I neither want or need.  I have noticed their prices are pretty good.  Compared to Hyatt's advertised prices, Shooters is quite a bit cheaper.

Last week it finally happened.  Shooters posted a deal that was too good to pass up so I stopped by ""just to look"" and went home with a new Sig.  

The staff was really great, nice, helpful, informative and seemed to know a lot about their inventory, which is as it should be of course.  I was doing some comparisons and they knew all the points and answers to the questions I was asking.  Special recognition goes to Dean and T.J.

Ammo availability is about the same as it is everywhere and there is a limit on how much you can buy.  The price is sky high but again, that is the norm everywhere and this too shall pass.

I wouldn't hesitate to send my daughter in there to buy a gun.


The Range:

Once the gun was mine, I needed to get some trigger time so today I was finally able to hit the range at Shooters for an hour or so.  Please note, it didn't cost me anything since they give you a free hour of range time with the purchase of a gun and I bring my own safety gear and ammo.

The range is small. the desk allows for only a couple of people and that was not a problem for me since there were only 1 or 2 others there when I arrived.  The guy at the desk is nice and funny.  When I left there were people waiting and it seemed to have filled up fast.  Some were watching the mandatory safety video, others just cooling their heels waiting for a lane.  My advice, go during the day on a weekday between 10:00 and 3:00 and you will sail right in.

Nice selection of rental guns, you can even rent a machine gun.  Be advised that you have to buy their ammo if you shoot their gun, but that is pretty much standard practice. They seem pretty laid back and not in your face, but they may get more ""alert"" during their busier times.

I'm looking forward to taking one of their classes and considering a membership.  Check them out."
"NC","On a weekday afternoon, I thought I might pop up here and refresh my skills at making holes in paper and high velocity rather than driving over to the range in Matthews. Since most folks were busy at their daily grind, there was no waiting.

It's small and it's loud but it's good enough. If you've never been here before, they have a three minute safety video that you have to watch. Once that's done, you're good to go!

I bring my own targets, my own ammunition, my own gun, my own ear/eye protection. So really, the only think I'm paying for here is the range time.

After my noise making was done, I wandered over to the other side of the shop and reviewed the hardware they had on sale. No great bargains, but no big markups either. A handgun I've been watching at another shop for $529 was $519 here. More or less, the same price.

This is a neat little range. If you're looking to shoot, this is a great place to go!"
"NC","Well my first time at the gun range,and I must admit...it was FUN! So here goes my Pros/Cons

Pros:
1. Knowledgeable Staff
2. Plenty of fire power
sadly that's where it ends

Cons:
1.BUSY-that's good thing for them, but you will have a wait! Especially on weekend
2.Small-there were people sitting on the floor, standing in corners. Literally shoulder to shoulder
3.Flustered Range officers-they are not unfriendly, just a lil overwhelmed by the amount of people and trying to keep up with everything going on. I guess I would be too if  30 people carrying rifles and pistols came walking through the door all at once
4. Price-seemed expensive to me. I shared a lane & gun plus ammo with my two sisters for 30 minutes and it came to $88!  All I remember hearing was $15 per gun

Not a bad place to visit if  you've ever wanted to go to a range, just keep in mind the small size and the long lines.."
"NC","My wife surprised me with a Living Social deal.  We went as a couple.  We had a blast!  Nice of them to run a LS deal.  

Since I have been there last (5 yrs), they have gone away from hunting and are almost 100% tactical.  So many toys, so little time."
"NC","When I first moved to the Charlotte area, finding a range was tough since Mecklenburg County has such strict laws governing firearm usage. I found Shooter's Express and began making it a monthly visit. Being new to the area, I thought that was how all ranges down here were. Having now found a different range of choice, I'd like to point out some pros and cons of this place. 

Pros:
1) Knowledgeable staff in the shop
2) Organized range officers
3) Friendly clientele

Unfortunately that is where the ""pro's"" end for me. 

Cons:
1) Busy - Hour plus wait on the weekends and even some weekdays
2) Small range. Yea, 25 yards, great, but the counter is CRAMPED (maybe fit 2 people side by side)
3) Unfriendly Range staff. They do get busy, and the staff seems to get flustered easily
4) Liars - I arrived to the range ON A WEEKDAY at 12:45, shot for a half hour, and then went to pay.  They charged me an hour, saying that the paper said 12:15, not 12:45, and had no interest in listening to me prove I wasn't there that long (I also wasn't going to argue too much with people carrying guns). I paid my over-charged rate and never returned.
5) No discipline - I have never once seen a range officer give any kind of instruction or discipline on the firing line to otherwise (even though there have PLENTY of times where that was warranted)

I could go on, but I think I've made my point. Truth be told, they aren't bad so long as you catch them when they aren't busy, and make sure they write down the correct time on your slip. I have found a nicer, cheaper, and less busy range that offers FAR more room and that has become my new home (until I have the land to build my own)."
"NC","This is our shooting range of choice, maybe due to proximity, but overall it's a good place to shoot. Ended up buying a year pass to the range which seemed like a reasonable rate especially if you plan to shoot several times a month and don't own a gun. Membership allows you to choose from the various guns to try out. Only had a problem with one getting jammed on me one time, otherwise, they are in good shape. Tape your targets up and send them down range. 


The safety video is a little old, looks like it was shot just after the Civil War, but everyone is required to watch it their first time out. Best advice is to always keep the gun pointed down range and never point at something/someone you don't want shot.  

Haven't spent much time in their gun shop, so can't comment on the service or prices there. However, they'll take care of you at the range."
"NC","My girlfriend and I like this place a lot. Call it in and they have it ready in about 10 minutes. Portions are a good size, enough for lunch the next day when I ordered the honey chicken. I recommend giving it a shot"
"NC","It was OK, I needed a Chinese food fix"
"NC","I love New China. The service is always fast and fresh! The sweet tea is amazing. Yes, Chinese takeout is everywhere but no one can Beat NEW China in Belmont!"
"NC","Just like any other take out chinese place.  Super quick, laden with msg and cheap!  
We got some take out and it didn't fail.  The tofu and veggies was cooked very well and I had a spring roll which didn't not fail me in my hour of need.

One fail on their part was that they forgot my rice, which I was somewhat looking forward to, but can't complain all that much.  

From the time we called in our order and left shortly after our food was made.  For two people, we paid 17 bucks and got 3 courses, so I was pleased enough... rice or no rice!"
"NC","It is your standard-issue Chinese joint complete with the same menu, food pictures, employees with the minimum English clarity that you find at all of these places.

For the first time since moving to the Belmont area, i craved some Chinese. i had noticed this little Chinese joint next to the Papa Johns in the Bi-Lo shopping strip and we decided to give it a try. 

We were waiting for a car to get done with an oil change so we opted to eat inside this little place. Had we gotten takeout, it may have been 3 stars because the food wasn't too shabby. Pretty standard General Tso chicken, although the broccoli was as cold as the seating area which required us to wear our jackets. 

Surprisingly they didn't overcharge for a canned beverage and they did have a self-serve tea station. 

While we were eating, we heard one of the cooks make the most obscene throat clearing noise that you usually only hear in the movies. It sounded like he was struggling to bring up a major loogie that was trapped deep within his soul. Fortunately we already had our food. 

If you're desperate for Chinese, get it to go."
"NC","I'm not one to complain, and I am not a picky eater, but that was undoubtedly the worst meal I have ever had. For eggs Benedict that came out over 30 minutes after ordering it, I would've expected it to at least be edible. The hollandaise sauce was sour and had a horrible vinegar taste to it. The only decent part of the meal was the potatoes, which were just roasted with salt and pepper. Definitely will not be returning for food."
"NC","Service has improved and the food is good"
"NC","Here for trivia night on Tuesday night. Love me some Christina but they are way under staffed. It took almost an hour to get out food. Good food but this is ridiculous.  We had to go to the bar to order drinks. They need to get some help in here or people will stop coming!"
"NC","Bar food
Decent bar food though.
Waitress was nice
Beer was cold 
Cool paintings and art
Atmosphere was warm and non pretentious"
"NC","Get your wallet ready, the prices are crazy high!"
"NC","We've never been here when there is much life in this place, but i still kind of like it. Whenever we are there, it feels more like a hangout for a few folks to have a drink at the bar, but they have ample space to be a full-fledged restaurant. The most spacious, spread out dining area in Belmont it seems. i just need to go at a better time when there is a crowd here (assuming that time exist) to get a true feel for them. There are a few paintings on the wall that contrast the drab overall feel at night. 

We have enjoyed their Chicken Jalapeno Dip twice now. Pretty tasty and pretty filling for two people. We split that with an entree and left full. 

Their Facebook page said something about a new tv and game room, it must have been in the back because we were watching sports on an antique television over the bar. They did have $1 Budweiser cans when we were there and Southern Tier on draft. Seems to be something on special most days."
"NC","The food is always good here.  You taste the specials and you know there is talent behind the food. Wished they ran lunch specials every day.  Drinks are stiff, service is good.  Great mixture of food, drink and service"
"NC","Overall a pretty relaxed atmosphere for drinking and/or eating. Mostly an older crowd (+35), but the occasional table of college kids hanging out during the late hours. 

Decent selection of beer on tap, & wide selection of bottled beer, wine, & liquor. The alcohol specials aren't anything too special & really doesn't provide a reason to visit if solely looking for specials. Plus, they've recently raised their prices & now have about the same prices as Sammy's, which I don't think bodes well for business. Also, Bentley's & Sammy's actually have daily specials that give people a reason to go there & drink.

The menu could use an upgrade, but if looking for some average bar food then this should fit your needs. From pizza, to sandwiches, to fried foods, it has all the typical bar specialties, but def could use some spicing up to draw more of a dinner crowd.

Overall, the wait staff makes you feel at home & it is a good place to relax and have a few drinks with friends."
"NC","I just love this place, always busy but honest and wiling to get you in and out as soon as possible.  Always remember your face.  Very friendly.  Great prices."
"NC","Best nail salon ever!! They always do a great job and the prices are very affordable. Everyone is always very nice and want to make sure that you are satisfed. I wouldn't go anywhere else."
"NC","Great nail spot in the northlake area - they recognize their returning customers, and are very friendly.  Competitively priced in comparison to Nail Saloons in the mall."
"NC","Absolute worst experience at a nail salon. My friend & I went to get our nails done, where the older man that worked there did mine. He had a very bad attitude & when I asked him to fix the shaping of my nails, he got mad and got nasty. My acrylics now look like crap, and i have cuts on my cuticles. My friend's nails looked like a 5 year old did them. Horrible paint job, shaping & when we went to go pay, the lady who did her nails over charged her by $15.00. We then had to go back in, so she could get her money back. Never going there again."
"NC","If your looking  for an AMAZING nail spot this is it. I have been going here for the last 2 years. Ann does my nails but if she is not available I use her husband andy. But any of the techs are great. It's clean and they remember your name and what you like done. I am a pink and white girl that's all I wear on my nails and they are the best at it. If you have any issues they will listen and correct no question ask.  Amazing customer service. If there was more stars I would give it. Always happy with the service I receive."
"NC","Just had the worst experience at a nail salon. A older male nail technician did my nails and i usually get the pink and white fill. He needs another class with filling in the white part and an attitude adjustment.  See pic.  I told him I didn't like it he said I was picky and they looked better than what I came in with. What???? Really I said. Ok. He said it's not gonna be perfect cause it's not a full set. Smh. I had just the white done and both at the same time from my regular nail technician can't wait till she's off maternity leave so disappointed. Tips on other places I can go hit me up! Two stars for bad attitude and he knew it was bad he told me I didn't have to pay full price. So I didn't pay for the white. Still just messed up. If u go there don let him do your pink n white he probably good at other things just not that."
"NC","Super clean little salon in Northlake area. Staff were very friendly and attentive. Did a great job on my manicure!"
"NC","I am visiting family for the holidays and joined this gym on a trial membership for the duration of my stay.  They were very accommodating and the trial was very inexpensive.  $22 for two weeks.  

This is a fairly large facility, with two pools, a full size gym for basketball, etc..  a small aerobics studio, and a cardio equipment room with approximately 15 elliptical machines, 20 treadmills, 10 bikes (aside from bikes reserved for spin classes), a couple of rowing machines, a variety of Freemotion resistance machines, a free weight area, etc.   There is also plenty of parking and a day care center.   

The cardio and resistance machines are mostly new and state of the art and they all face a row of several tv's that are mounted in the middle of the room.  Each is tuned to a major station, (CNN, ESPN, ABC, etc)  has closed captioning, and there is a place to plug your headphones in on each machine - though I did not see if it actually worked.

I do wish they would ban the use of cell phones during your workout.  We do this at many, many gyms in the Silicon Valley and it really cuts down on the annoyance factor.   I'm here to get away from business and other issues and have some ""me time"" in order to clear my head and to focus on my health.  You, Jabberjaws, should be doing the same.

Other than that, there is a 60 min time limit on machines, and disinfectant spray with paper towels to clean the machines after use.    Great.  Though washable hand towels may be more ecologically sound. 

I chose this gym because of the abundance of classes, including the ones I take at my gym at home - which are Zumba and the Les Mills classes (Bodypump, Bodycombat, etc).    They also offer Yoga, Pilates, Spinning and a variety of other classes.

I took the Bodypump class and it was fine in that you know what to expect because Les Mills classes are a franchise type deal - so the choreography is always the same.  However, I was disappointed that the class was held in the Gym.   

Due to the high gym ceilings it was very echo-y and difficult to hear the instructor and the music.  In addition, half of the gym was curtained off and people were playing basketball on the other side.  The noise was very distracting on top of the poor acoustics and made it even more difficult to hear.   The equipment was also pretty run down - but useable.   I understand that the facility is run by the city so one thing at a time, I suppose.

The instructor was good but not great.  I have *alot* of experience with fitness classes and am a professional dancer.   I can safely say that her counts and cues were slightly off... particularly compared to other instructors I have experience with.  But , she was very friendly, attentive, and helpful. 

I also took the Tuesday night Zumba class and the instructor was a substitute during Xmas.   She was good but not great.  She did not follow through on movements (ie: no extension in her arms and her steps were shortened) and her rhythm was slightly off.   But she was very nice and encouraging and she knew her routines well.  

I have been taking Zumba for over two years now, with several different instructors back home, and I am used to mostly VERY difficult workouts. This was not particularly hard for me, but YMMV.   If you are experienced at all with Zumba or other aerobics classes, you'll likely know how make it harder on yourself, if needed.  

I never did make it to the BodyCombat class, so I can't say how that compares but I would encourage anyone to try it.  It's generally an easy to follow cardio-kickboxing class that can be modified for all levels.  

When I return next year for the holidays I will likely join this gym again.   Overall, it was helpful to keep me on track with the battle of the Xmas bulge."
"NC","HFFA is a year round gym and aquatics center.

Pros:

-No shortage of lanes for swimming.  When the pool is arranged for 25 yds, there are 6 member lanes available. When the pool is 50m, there are a minimum of 3 lanes available.

-New equipment.  As of January 2014 all of the weight machines have been replaced by top of the line machines.  HFFA also expanded the cardio area to include countless ellipticals, treadmills, and stationary bikes.

-Open at 5am weekdays, open relatively long hours on weekends.

Cons:

-The new equipment comes at a cost.  HFFA got rid of almost all the free weights.  That means no benching, squats, preacher curls, roman chair, or Captain chair.  This is a dealkiller to some, and I go to HFFA for the gym portion far less often now.

-Old building.  It was just renovated in Jan 2014, but it does not feel any newer.

-Pool is inconsistent in temperature.  the circulation of the pool seems strange, as one corner is noticably warmer than the rest of the pool, and the water temperature is a bit cold compared to pools I frequented in the past."
"NC","As a parent of a swimmer this is really not a great pool for watching a meet. The stands are small and the tiny results scoreboard is blocked by the crowd if not directly behind you. Parking is atrocious. The positive is the pool is pretty new and in good condition ."
"NC","we are members sines 2010 and we are very happy with the classes and the gym,
last weekend we wanted to do our son 6th birthday,the room was set up great  but when we needed help with more napkins , cups  and juice for the kids they run out and i had to go out and leave to the store in the middle of   my sons birthday,and above that they tried to charge us for 2 more cups that we needed .
i will stay a member of the gym but no more birthdays."
"NC","I swim at this facility several times a week. There is a very small 25 yard warm water pool that is used primarily for swimming lessons, physical therapy, & recreation.  The competition pool configuration changes between 50 meters and 25 yards, depending on the day and time. 

While I swim in many pools, the HFFA 50 meter pool tends to be one of the cooler (temp wise) practice pools in the Charlotte area. 78 - 79 is an ideal temp for me. This pool often feels cooler than that. On one occasion, our coach even had us swim in the warm & cloudy 25 yard pool bc this pool was so cold.

The facility is older, but if you are a swimmer this is a great place and will definitely meet your needs. If you are in need of any equipment, just stop by the Carolina Swim Shop located inside HFFA. 

Be aware that many local high schools & MAC practice here in the evening and the place gets crowded, especially the parking lot.

The women's locker room is nothing to write home about, but it does have individual shower stalls with curtains and a couple of hair dryers. Children 3 and older are not allowed in the opposite gender's locker room. Moms & dads be aware that the few individual family locker rooms fill up very quickly when swim school is in session. You may have to stand with your shivering child in the cold hallway while you wait your turn. It would be great if they had men's and women's large family locker rooms rather that single rooms.

My four stat rating is based primarily on the pools. It is the only fitness facility in the Lake Norman area, that I am aware of, with a 50 meter pool. While it is worn from usage and the locker rooms aren't the greatest, I like having access to a long course pool. I really wish this facility also had a steam room."
"NC","If you're a Huntersville resident, you should be a member of HFFA. They have an excellent facility, complete with 2 indoor pools, a full workout room, a full-size basketball court, and plenty of classes for an incredibly low price.

Yes, the place gets crowded during certain times and the weight equipment could use an upgrade, but fixes for those items are in the works. I'm personally looking forward to another power rack and better floors in the weight area. In fact, I'd pay a few dollars more each month if I could get these things faster.

Finally, if you have children, HFFA has several classes and activities for kids so you can get them involved in a healthy lifestyle, too."
"NC","Great aquatic facility but the larger/competitive pool is FREEZING.  I was a competitive swimmer for 12 years and this is one of the coldest pools I've been in.  The warm water pool serves it's purpose but could be larger for sure.  It is very heavily used.  The facility offers a wide variety of classes and is very family friendly.  But with such a large amount of members, the facility is in need for an expansion.  The exercise room/weight room could easily be double the size and still be relatively crowded.  Overall a nice facility but starting to show a little wear and tear and in need of an expansion/renovation."
"NC","Great location.  Kids really enjoy all the activities."
"NC","I enjoy the group exercise classes at HFFA.  The hip-hop cardio held in the gym was a pretty good workout.  The class was full and everyone had a great time.  Initially I thought I would have to step out but it quickly had me working up a sweat.  Sometimes you just have to be patient and go with the flow.  The center has an olympic sized pool and a smaller, warm pool used for swim lessons and recreational swimming.  They also have a child care center for the little ones while you are working out either in a class, on aerobic equipment, or in the free-weight area that is primarily dominated by men.  I like free weights so they will have to move over!

The place can get pretty crowded after work hours with both adults and young adults (older kids).  The parking lot has been overcrowded this month.  I sincerely hope that all who are venturing out to get fit will continue the journey throughout the year."
"NC","My friends and I visited Charlotte, NC for the weekend. We planned a horseback riding event at Latta Equestrian Center.  Out of the 6 of my friends only 1 of us have ever ridden a horse. We were nervous about riding the horse once the horses were brought up. This was definitely different, fun, and exciting. We had a great time on our horseback hour trail. Mr. Trace was our tour guide, we really enjoyed him. He was really friendly and made everyone feel comfortable with their horses. My horse was, Horse Benny.  I would recommend visiting Latta Equestrian Center too anyone that would love to experience riding a horse."
"NC","This review is for one particular service they offer at Latta's Equestrian Center their sunset horseback ride and bonfire dinner.

This is an amazing all inclusive date if you are looking to surprise your significant other with something out of the ordinary in Charlotte. The price is up to $65 a person now and is only offered Friday or Saturday evenings around the warmer months of the year.

At first I was hesitant to spend that much for a night out in Charlotte, but honestly you are making some great memories and the steak they grilled up for me was cooked perfect, extremely tasty, and about twice the size cut of meat you would get from an overpriced dinner downtown.

No experience riding is necessary, they will ask you what you know when you arrive, and since we knew nothing they put us on some of the older calmer horses. The horseback ride was very relaxing that is if you can get over the giant wedgie and discomfort down below that comes with horseback riding. You get use to it after awhile and begin to lose yourself in thoughts on the ride. I found myself talking to my horse a lot, but that was probably from fear of being thrown off. The leader of the pack winds you all over the grounds of Latta Plantation by their lakes and trails and eventually everyone literally rides off into the sunset.

When you arrive back to the stables they have a giant bonfire going and some of the locals there have grilled up an amazing feast.  When you book your date you mention whether you want chicken or steak and when you see the size of the offerings your money feels well spent. You get all the classic stuff with your meal corn on the cob, baked beans, baked potato, buttered bread, and of course a giant cut of meat. They offer sodas, water, and sweet tea for drinks. 

Definitely worth booking if you want to impress someone on a first date in Charlotte, or if you are just an adventurous couple looking for something other than the typical dinner and a movie.

Check out their site for booking information:

"NC","Well, I'm no cowgirl but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy a good trail ride with an even tempered steed.  Now, riding a stubborn steed by a waterfall in Mexico turns what would be a lovely experience into a fright fest but that's another story.
Today, David X and I took the guided riding tour of Latta Plantation Park.  For $25, this entails a trail leader riding in front, and a party of 8 riders following along in a line.  They ask you how green you are, assign you a horse based on that, and give you the needed pointers: go, slow down, stop, turn.  Feet here, knees here, hands here, and you're off.  The trail guide knew the story of each horse so if you're curious you can ask.  Mine was actually a rescue story: Billy Jack was an overworked racehorse with a broken knee and scarred up legs and hide, they brought him in and rehabbed him and now he rides easy trails in his golden years.  The ride is about 45 minutes or so, and they make a point to rotate horses in and out so that no horse is worked all day.  
Now they offer a longer ""private ride"" for $35 which I assume means you are not in a party of 8, and they also offer the ""sunset ride"" on certain days, which includes a two-hour ride just past sunset and a ""cowboy dinner"" (either chicken or steak is what the listing said) for $60.  That's a bit steep for my tastes but I could see it being a real nice date for the right kind of couple.
They also mentioned having pony rides for tykes, formal riding lessons, hay rides during October, and some other more advanced stuff for people who are into BYOH.  I could surely see myself bringing family/visitors here."
"NC","Very cool family trip not a lot of activities and the costumed employees acted  like we were actually bothering them. Never the less it was fun and my daughter liked it"
"NC","I definitely learned alot about the south here. Really glad we spent a few hours here.  Makes you appreciate modern times."
"NC","Great place for hiking - the trails are pretty clear and there are lots of them! Only wish there were bathroom facilities near the entrance to the trails. Also, the raptor center is pretty cool - took my son a couple of years ago and will be taking him again this year now that he's a little older. Other than that, haven't really done any of the tours or horseback riding, but a great place for an outing with the kids!"
"NC","I hiked here with my dog the other day and fell in love. It's true what they say about the horses though, you have to be careful where you walk! We hiked through there for about an hour taking our time and never came across anyone riding horses and barely came across people. We were there super early though so that may have been the reason. Now that I have discovered this park I will be here all the time, a great place to get away from the 'city'."
"NC","Be attentive on the trails or you might just step in a pile of horse poo. Yes, you share the trails with horseback riders. This is one of the only trails that allow horse riding. There is an equestrian center and parking for trailers available.

The lake is beautiful and prehistoric fish have been spotted in there which grow up to 6 feet in length with razor sharp teeth...so don't fall in for fear of being eaten...not really, but I let my imagination get the better of me. 

There are many things for all family members. Picnic areas, wide trails, the Rapor Center, the Historic Latta Plantation, etc. During the warmer weather, you can rent canoes or kayaks. 

Yay for nature and a lot of it at Latta Plantation Park!"
"NC","Beautiful park in the Charlotte area. Great for hiking or running on the trails, you can canoe in the lake, fish if you have a license, you can bike here,  have a picnic, go horseback riding, visit the Raptor center there is plenty to do here. Plus you have to visit the Plantation itself very nice.  I can't wait to comeback here."
"NC","Living in the burbs and spending most of my time in the city, I always look and seek out some natural green space now and then.  Running on the greenways are great, but it is rare to have a good amount of land dedicated to nature and activities.  Latta Plantation Park is not only home to the Carolina Raptor Center, but also has a number of horse trails (you can use for running and hiking as well) and access to Mountain Island Lake for water activities.

I came here for an open water swimming event (NOTE:  there is no swimming in the lake unless it is a sanctioned event).  It was strange getting into the water right were a big ""NO SWIMMING"" warning sign was posted.  The no swimming rule is probably due to the way the lake was formed and Duke Energy's involvement, but the rules are the rules.  There are plenty of houses that dot the perimeter with docks and watercraft.

The park facilities are well kept and there is a good sense of trying not to interfere too much with nature."
"NC","I've been dying to go on a hike but didn't know where to go since I'm relatively new to the area. A couple of people recommended checking out Latta Plantation Nature Preserve, so this morning I woke up, slapped on my hiking gear and headed out to check out the trails.

There is a total of fourteen miles of trail at the park, and most of them take you through some scenic areas, whether it be within the forest or alongside a huge field. There are at least ten different trails to choose from, and they are made for hiking as well as horseback riding. That being said, as a hiker you'll have to balance between taking in the scenery and watching where you step, as you will come across plenty of piles of horse...droppings. 

My only real complaint is that the trails are a bit confusing at times. There were at least two intersections I came across that weren't clearly marked, and I ended up turning where I didn't want to or totally missing the turn I was looking for. The map I was given at the Nature Center (where you park the car) wasn't much help at all, as the map was in black and white, but the trails are color coded. Yeah, not much help at all.

Still, I'll put up with being a bit lost. If anything it leads to a grand adventure in the outdoors. I'll definitely be back the next time I get a chance to go hiking, as it's pretty darn close to my apartment. I just hope they have some colored maps next time I go."
"NC","Stopped here while visiting from out of town on a clear chilly day. It was Beautiful and the snow covered ground was neat! It appears to have some history here along with a lake, raptor museum etc and other things we didn't get to explore."
"NC","Within the park exists the Historical Plantation, the Equestrian center, the Nature Preserve and the Carolina Raptor Center.  This is a very pretty park preserve with lots of walking and riding (horses, bikes and I did see some segways as well, yeesh) trails.  So there's plenty of stuff to do.  Many of them lead to the various overlooks and launch points into Mountain Island lake, where it seems folks enjoy canoeing and water skiing, and a few rogue kids were wading.  There are some picnic tables and picnic-table-like rocks that you can set down and enjoy a snack on.  It's a relatively small preserve operated by Meck county, so it's not nearly the adventure you'd enjoy driving out to the woods woods but if you've got kids or horses or something or you just don't feel like driving the almost three hours to get out there, this is a nice natural break from the ordinary."
"NC","Creepy to think that at one point in history - on the same land upon which one stands at the moment -- people were held captive and required to provide all types of dirty work in downright nasty conditions. Yet the Latta tour guide explains the historical perspective of the situation and the contextual understanding reveals that perhaps of all plantations, this particular one may not have been the worst in treating its slaves. All folks of every race and nationality should venture here for an illuminating snapshot into the history of one of the most dishonorable times this country has ever faced. Thank you Latta for the reminder the darkest of historical events must be showcased for all to see."
"NC","This place is great for the whole family. Admission was $8.00 because they were having a special holiday program. The grounds were just like it was back in the 1800's. The houses and cabins are in excellent shape. The gift shop was nice and the civil reenactment was nice to watch. This place is perfect for a great history lesson."
"NC","I came here in October and ended up going on the ""Ghost Tales in the Dark"" tour. Pretty much, you get a candlelit tour of the plantation at night. And your tour guide gives a history lesson on the house and plantation, as well as shares some ghost stories that either they/coworkers have experienced.

If you come at night, it can be a little scary getting here. Once you turn off the main street, you're driving down a dark road with nature on both sides of you. Since we were already in a spooky spirit, it kind of felt like we were in a horror movie, hehe. Once you arrive at the plantation though, you just park and walk into their little gift shop. After everyone arrives, you watch a little video about the history of the place, including paranormal history. After that, your tour starts.

You walk over to the house, and tour the house, from downstairs to upstairs. Then, you walk outside to the outdoor kitchen, and then to a workmen's shed. Then you walk past an old log cabin, and then get led back to the main gift shop. 

The tour guide we had a was a very informative old lady. She told us a lot of history, and I learned new things. At one point of the tour, I did get a little lightheaded, and felt a little weird, and it was near an area where the tour guide said that she also has had weird feelings. What's even weirder is that on our back home, my dad was telling me that he got lightheaded in a certain area, and when I asked him where, it was the same place I had gotten the same feeling! It was kinda spooky finding that out, but then kind of cool.

The tour was about ~$10 and I think it was worth it. I got a little spook, and learned a good history lesson. And I visited a historic plantation.

If you're visiting the area, and are looking for something interesting and different to do, I suggest coming here. No matter what time of year. But if you happen to come during October, then you'll just get an added bonus of hearing some ghost stories along the way too."
"NC","We stopped by here while vacationing in Charlotte. Worth the $7 for the admission. Great history lesson for all ages. A little to hard to find at first because it is so deep into the woods. shows what life was life was like back in the 1800's. I would  recommend this as a family trip because you get a greater appreciation for what you have now. You also will be happy to see just how far this country has come when it comes to equality. The gift shop is nice as wel. We bought a couple of cook books with recipes from the time."
"NC","Took the guided house tour on a Friday morning. The four of us were the only people taking the tour, which was really nice because we had all of our questions answered and were able to spend a good bit of time in the main Latta house. The grounds are really beautiful and after your house tour you can walk around and see the animals and smaller houses on the plantation. This is definitely a must for anyone from Charlotte or visiting Charlotte."
"NC","HISTORIC LATTA PLANTATION
Come check out this historica plantation if you're into old history about how farm life and slavery was back in the days in North Carolina. Small quaint houses and animals adorn this quiet farmstead. Luckily for me, today, there was a WWII reenactment happening this weekend.

On the night of July 9th, 1943, the Allied invasion of Sicily , codenamed Operation Husky, commenced. This proved to be a very important WWII campaign which incorporated both amphibious and airborne operations. The Battle For Sicily consisted of 6 hard weeks of land combat pushing the Axis Army into Italy. This kicked off the Italian Campaign which would last until the end of the war in Europe. The Allied Army was made up of soldiers from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Newfoundland, and the Free French - a total of 160,000 personnel. The Axis Army was made up of soldiers fro Italy and Germany - a total of 290,000 personnel.

Here, in this reenactment, German soldiers take over a plantation and battle both US and British armed forces, where they are defeated when they get attacked on both sides. Even with a German halftrack, the battle is lost for the Germans!"
"NC","I've been to Latta plenty of times since we moved here, either to go hiking at the Nature Center or checking out the birds at the Raptor Center. With my parents and nephew in town I figured it was time to finally check out the plantation house that is also on the property. 

The plantation area consists of an old 1800s house along with other supporting out-buildings and a small livestock area. Things were a bit different with it being Memorial Day, as the usual guided tour of the main house was replaced by re-enactors stationed within each room. They were pretty informative and either discussed the house or time period in general or gave an explanation of the task they were performing (weaving, pulling cotton, spooling yarn, etc.) 

There were also a few re-enactors outside who were doing additional demonstrations. My nephew really enjoyed listening to the guy who was tanning animal hides, and he also enjoyed panning for gold and participating in military drilling. There was also a small corral where you can look at pigs, goats, horses and chickens. 

It's fun for a first-time visit, but the novelty of taking in an 1800s plantation house is worn after one trip. There isn't all that much to do, and there happened to be more during my trip since it was a holiday weekend. I would recommend checking their website before planning a visiting and waiting for a weekend where they had some extra activities going on."
"NC","This was a fun little side mention on our trip along the eastern seaboard.
I absolutely love history and although not the best historical point on our trip, it was cute seeing the old farm house and the animals.
my favorite were the pigs, even though i was bitten by one of them."
"NC","My daughter first took horseback riding lessons here over 15 years ago. We found it to be a solid and affordable place for her as a beginner. The instructor that she had at the time was very patient and kind to kids as well as the horses.  He was able to teach her all the basics and gave her a good foundation for her later training. 

Later on, we ended up moving to a stable much closer to home that offered more challenges for her as well as more opportunities for competition -especially in the hunter-jumper arena. 

However, we have have been back to Latta many times for her to compete in dressage shows and have also come back for trail rides. 

If you are interested in a trail ride or beginner lessons, they have some really gentle horses.  The facilities are nice for horse and rider alike."
"NC","I've visited once for horseback riding and once for a picnic.

Grounds- well kept- absolutely beautiful, perfect for a day hike or a picnic. We saw several girlscout/boyscout groups here so it's kid-friendly. As mentioned by other reviewers there are picnic tables and covered pavilions. The horse farm area is nicely kept and the animals all look very happy and healthy.

Service- They have assisted trail rides and dinners. I would love to give the trail dinner a try- how fun would that be at sunset? I had a groupon or livingsocial coupon so my trail ride was only $12 - but even full price was in the $20 range and not too bad. I think the dinners were a bit more as expected. 

Our trail guide was friendly and nice- my only complaint was while saddling up one of the younger guys was smoking away- not exactly my idea of getting some fresh air. 

I will definitely visit this area again- one could easily spend a day here!"
"NC","Went here last weekend with the girls for the ""Bark In the Park"" event at Rural Hill.  We had an absolutely wonderful day. Afterward, we decided to head over to  Latta Plantation.  The grounds are so beautiful. We decided to be adventurous and have a picnic!  We found some covered pavillions outside that came equiped with benches for eating.  There are also bbq stations free for anyone to use.  

We did not venture inside to ask about hiking trails but I have been here once on  my own and did some fantastic trails.  They also have a large section of this plantation dedicated to horseback riding.  I believe if you go inside the building, someone would be able to explain the options of adventure that are available to you."
"NC","I just got back from Christmas at Latta Plantation. I took my 12-year-old twin boys. We toured the small nature center first (minor point if interest), and then paid our $17 to see the Plantation.

The Visitor Center had a movie running in the exhibit area that lasted over an hour. It was about Harriet Tubman helping free the slaves, and had a Christmas theme. We caught parts of it on the way in and out... It was really a bit slooow for this sort of place.

The Visitor Center exhibits explain a lot about the folks who lived there a long time ago, and they display some of their relics. You can also grab some refreshments and souvenirs, if interested.

The large house is fully decorated, and we took a tour that showed us how folks lived back then. It was moderately elegant, but life was still hard. 

There was a weaver working upstairs, and museum workers in each room showed us some of the features of the house. 

A kitchen out back was fully functional, with a demonstration of brick fireplace cooking going on.

There are sheep, cows, pigs, goats, and horses here. A slave cabin is set up, so you can see how the slaves lived at the time. 

This is a small plantation, so don't expect anything lavish. But do expect to find a museum-like experience that does give an honest portrayal of liffe in the pre-civil war era."
"NC","Took the family here after seeing a review on yelp. I am so glad I did. We had an excellent time. It took us longer than expected to get there because of a detour on Neck Road but we all enjoyed driving thru the winding roads while observing the beautiful colors of fall. 

When we arrived everything was well organized. They had people there to flag drivers to parking spots. The people leaving were happily joking and laughing so we knew we were in for a treat. 

There were quite a few people taking pictures, buying pumpkins, and eating at the picnic tables yet there was no long line to wait in to purchase tickets. Once we had our tickets in hand we were treated to a humorous and very informative orientation. One of the gentleman that helped design the maze gave us some great tips on how to navigate our way through before nightfall.  Yeah...we probably should have paid more attention and taken notes.

We started the maze and were excited from beginning to end. There were several groups aimlessly walking about and we all traded info to help each other to the end. This was a very nice family outing. It took us about two hours to find our way to the end. The wife and I racked up lots of steps on the fitbits and the kids slept well that night. We plan to make this a yearly thing for us."
"NC","I attended the evening flashlight maze on Saturday evening. Bring your own flash light. It was a ton of fun and the maze really lives up to it's name. This year's maze was made into a baseball theme. 

The orientation is crucial for tips and hints on getting through the maze. The staff is also helpful during your trek through the maze. Don't be afraid to ask others for help. 

They also had a variety of fair food (funnel cakes, fried oreos, corn dogs etc) available for purchase. 

I highly recommend for a night of fall fun!"
"NC","The GF and I have done this for the last 2 years and love it.  We've gone for the night maze both times and had a blast.  It is NOT an easy thing to get through, so be prepared to be patient.  You will go through the same area multiple times completely by accident, but you'll eventually figure it out.  This is definitely something that will continue being an annual tradition for us.  Nothing better than getting lost in a cornfield for an hour or 2 on a crisp autumn night."
"NC","Wow! Talk about true to it's name - this place lives up to it!! Amazing. Maize. Maze.

It's located out in the middle of nowhere - but thats where you're suppose to get lost right?!?

The maze is huge!! They show you an overall map at the beginning and then give you a blank one with numbered squares. You have to go throughout the maze and find the numbered mailboxes, which inside, a square piece of the map that you are trying to put together to find your way out. You get a huge flag to carry through with you, so if you need help the staff can locate you quickly.  

It's fun for about an hour - then you become crazed and really just want to get out. The end was pretty challenging and it took us about an hour & a half to complete it - we did get all the numbered map squares/pieces. 


*Best tip about this place: Follow the water marks.... (They have jugs of water in the maze for when people get thirsty - they place them at specific locations where there are maze helpers who can answer questions and assist you in finding your way. Follow the water marks on the ground to wear they carried the coolers to and you'll find help)"
"NC","Went here on Saturday with the family and this is the second year in a row we have been because we love it so much!

The corn maze is not some walk in the park maze.....be prepared to spend atleast an hour in there (or even more if you are trying to get all the pieces of the map). They give you a blank map to the corn maze and then you have to find the 12 hidden mail boxes that contain pieces of the map. Each year, the maze has a theme....this year was barnyard and last year was politics. Head on over to their website cause I think it is really interesting learning how they even create this 3 miles of maze out there! 

There are bunch of other activities out there too: toys for kids, hay rides, food, corn hole, etc. Great place to spend a few hours one afternoon. They also have nighttime mazes where you do it with a flashlight.

PS- I have never actually done this with kids. Last year I went with my brother and another couple (all adults) and this year I went with my husband and my parents. So, don't think this is some kid place that only kids can enjoy! We saw equal number of groups with kids and groups without kids!"
"NC","I have taken 2 teams from work for team building exercise to the Maze. The staff accommodated our large groups and gave us a fun orientation for the maze. There were several ways to complete the maze. We decided on completing the map, find all 12 pieces. Luckily, everyone made it out of the field before dusk. When each team finished they were able to announce their victory over the speaker system. They did play some old songs over the speakers, but your having to much fun in the maze to care."
"NC","My boyfriend and I were excited to try out the amazing maize maze on a sunday afternoon. We were disappointed. It costs $10.00 per person and for the price, didn't really impress us. There are loud speakers all over the maze and the person on the other end of the speaker was loud and distracting. Sprinkled between the woman's loud voice on the speakers was the same country song playing over and over again. It took us 55 minutes to get through the maze and by the end, we both had headaches from the loud speaker noise. Not worth the money :/"
"NC","We challenged ourselves again this year to the Amazing Maize Maze.  Being that this was our 2nd year, we understood the concept a bit better and were able to more easily find all the clues and the pieces to the corn maze map.  (It ""only"" took us 2.25 hours instead of 3.)  However, once we had all 12 pieces of the map, we ran into our most difficult challenge:  following the map to find the one single way out of the corn maze!   UGH.  We were about 50 feet from the exit when we found our final piece of the puzzle, but ""you can't get there from here!""  We ended up walking another couple miles through the ENTIRE corn maze again just to get out.  It's a great challenge--both for the mind and the feet!"
"NC","Looking for something fun to do with the whole family or a group of friends?  Do you enjoy a challenge?  

Every fall, Rural Hill Farm offers the ""Amazing Maize Maze,"" a challenging corn maze where you collect clues to find your way out!  We went last year for the first time and are going again this year.  

Last year, there was a drought in NC so their corn maze was only about waist high in some spots.  We thought it would be easy and a good ""starter.""  Um...no.  We soon discovered that even if you can see where you need to get to...you still don't know how to get there.  It was quite challenging, we were there for a few hours, got lost, but finally found all the clues, worked out the puzzle, and found our way out of the maze.  With more normal rain levels, this year promises to be even more challenging...and we're ready for it!  (I think)

Oh...and they have a pumpkin patch and hayrides.  If we find our way out this year, maybe we'll give 'em a try!  And for those of you who REALLY like a challenge, try the farm's Flashlight Maze at night.  And let me know how it was by the time you come out around February!"
"NC","This is a great way to spend a few hours (or 45 minutes, in my case. Strong am I with the force ;) with friends or a significant other. 

I've been to the Amazing Maize Maze a few times and gotta say that it is really fun! Plus I am a sucker for clever puns.

Come prepared for the weather, as it takes some people 2-3 hours to get out of the maze. A light snack may not be that bad either. Water is provided throughout. 

Surprisingly, there is more to the maze than just the maze. Of course your goal is to get out, but also to find 12 stations containing pieces of a map AND also reading ""kernels of knowledge"" (get it) listed on boards throughout the maze, which help you solve a cross-word puzzle. This flexibility allows many ways to enjoy the maze and to make it more challenging. Or you can pound through and just try to find the exit.

There are helpers in the maze to give hints, and also at the bridge and tower. You also get a tall flag to use for help if need be, but you can opt out.   

Totally do it!"
"NC","A couple of us went to the Amazing Maize this past weekend (the weekend it opens for the year.) The maze is open rain or shine, and it happened to be sprinkling this day...

The staff was amazing and very helpful. The water stops are evenly and well placed, and while you don't get a prize for finishing it you do feel that your brain and legs received a workout.

To whoever is complaining about $10, the maze normally takes 1-3 hours depending on your skills. From the the staff on site and all the work that goes into creating the maze, I do feel that it is worth it and worth the price per time.

Music = they have speakers playing country and oldies. It wasn't too loud for us, and kept us company as we were lost all of the place!

I recommend it to all! Maybe not for kids  under 7 or so, unless they don't mind walking."
"NC","This was my first visit to The Amazing Maize Maze located in Rural Hill. Corn stalks everywhere. 

There is an orientation where someone goes over the map of the maze, information about estimated time frame going through the maze. There are 12 mailboxes in the maze. Good luck with finding the mailboxes. What a workout!!! Watch out for the dead end trails. Every group gets a flag for their team. This is so much fun for the whole family. See kids figure out the maze, get clues to crossword puzzle, and get funnel cakes to munch on. Great way to spend the day/afternoon with the family."
"NC","This is an amazing way to spend a fall afternoon. You will get your daily dose of exercise and more. My preteen daughter who normally only likes to brood in her room even enjoyed it. Great thing to do with your middle school aged kids. There were quite a few people there toting toddler age kids around on their backs. I thought they must have been crazy. Last place I would want to be is stuck in a maze with a cranky 2 year old. 

It took us 1 hour and 15 minutes to get out and we promptly rewarded ourselves with some fried oreos from the food tent outside the maze. There are other things to do such as a hayride and corn hole. Plus they have soccer goals set up. Will be returning next year!"
"NC","I took my kids here one afternoon when my wife was out of town on business, and was pleasantly surprised by how much fun we all had. Lots of great birds, from condors to bald eagles, in a beautiful wooded setting. There's also a very cool playground in the middle that my kids almost found more interesting than the raptors. A fun outdoor experience that also serves an important purpose."
"NC","It's been awhile since I treated myself for my birthday to the PhotoWILD day, and to this day it's one of the best things I've ever done.  From the website:  

Each day highlights over 20 different raptors in unique settings each day.

The day starts with an early-bird breakfast at 7:30 am, followed by six, thirty minute sessions -- we'll have lots of birds each session to choose from. The final hour of each day features some of our flight show superstars in free-flight!

http://www.carolinaraptorcenter.org/experience/photowild

Take your camera and treat yourself, or a loved one."
"NC","I'm sure you're wondering how GOOD a bird zoo can really be. I was really impressed with this place. The setting is wonderful, and the birds are really something.  Take some time to see a show. A little hokey, but a fun way to see the birds up close and appreciate the relationships between staff people and these interesting animals. A great way to spend a couple of hours in the (mostly shaded by beautiful forest) outdoors."
"NC","This place was pretty neat. It's much like a park with multiple outdoor exhibits featuring almost exclusively birds that are too injured to be released. Many of them are missing parts of a wing so they can't be rehabilitated but their cages seem to be roomy enough and they do seem well cared for. 

I think this place was a once and done for me in that I had a good time the first time but I don't have particular motivation to go back. It was nice walking along the trail through the woods but I would consider wearing bug repellant because I left with a few bites (but I'm a mosquito magnet). It's definitely worth seeing this place, especially at only 10 dollars per adult."
"NC","I love zoos and animals, so I was looking forward to checking out the Raptor Center. We had my niece and nephew last weekend (ages 6 and 3) so we decided to take them there to check out the birds.

I enjoyed the center and felt the price was right for the amount of exhibits and time it takes to get around ($10 adults, free kids under 4). The Raptor Center is a sanctuary for birds who would not make it in the wild, and they go to schools to educate young kids about raptors, so I didn't exactly feel bad paying since I knew it was going to a good cause. They had several different kinds of owls, eagles, hawks, vultures and other predatory birds. Most of the habitats seemed to be a decent size for the animal inside, and the birds themselves seemed relatively comfortable. There was also a little playground based on Harry Potter for the kids to play in, and they liked that. The staff there were very friendly and informative, and several who were transporting a bird from one area to the next were more than happy to take a few seconds to tell us a little about the bird and let the kids get a good look at it.

My nephew really enjoyed looking at all the birds, and he even knew a little on his own since the center had brought some birds over to his school. My three year old niece didn't care for it as much and was more interested picking rocks and thistles out of the dirt then looking at birds in cages. I was really glad that she was free and we didn't have to pay for her!

Overall, it's a really clean, friendly, and educational experience. Check out some cool looking birds while walking the trails and learn about these beautiful raptors. Great for kids and adults."
"NC","The birds were impressive and the bald eagle enclousure was great. A little pricey for small children."
"NC","Although I'm scared of bird (I suffered a vicious peacock attack as a child (seriously)), this place was pretty cool.

We just happened to arrive as one a raptor presentation was beginning.  Seeing a presentation is a must (the trip would have not been as good without it).  The woman doing the presentation brought out a number of birds and told us lots of interesting info about them.

After that, we just walked around to the different cages and checked out the other birds.  If you want to take pictures, bring a camera with a zoom lens (I couldn't get close enough for my iPhone pictures to be very good)."
"NC","Quick one.  After reading Kathy's review I remembered how amazing this place is and how lucky we are to have it so close by.

My first encounter with Owls.  Its been a while, so I definitely need to go back, and will do whatever I can to bring others with me.  $10 at most to get in, but I'm sure some donations and/or sponsoring a bird would be greatly appreciated.  For $45 bucks a year you can you can go whenever you want and bring a friend.

Great for kids!

Will update upon my next visit, hopefully sooner rather than later."
"NC","*disclaimer up front*
I am a transport volunteer for the injured raptors coming into this facility. Most of my ""deliveries"" get euthanized because of the severity of their injuries... and I see this place as the single best way to educate John Q. Public about why these birds die needlessly every day. 
Before I became a transporter, I visited here at the urging of friends... and, friend, I was hooked. This is one of the best, intelligent displays/educational interactions of birds of prey I have ever seen. I bring my friends and family here whenever they visit because it is that cool, and that important. I even have a friend who also became a volunteer here after visiting."
"NC","I suppose I'm biased because I've always loved raptors, owls particularly.  But I very much enjoyed seeing the owls, vultures, hawks, falcons, eagles, kestrels, and lively visiting corvidae (ravens, crows and magpies).  These are probably the chillest raptors you'll ever see.  I guess it'd kind of be like visiting an outdoor rehab center for permanently injured athletes.  These birds were once the rulers of the sky, swooping down on irritating prey like rats and skunks in the blink of an eye... until some sad tragedy, a bullet, a car moving too quickly - cut short their majestic reign.  So these raptors, for the most part fairly acclimated to human presence, will merely eyeball you as you walk by their aviaries or embarrass yourself by clicking and hooting to get their attention.
Stop in for the mini-lecture for an up close view of some of the birds, as well as some interesting background information."
"NC","Five stars for the ultimate mix of education and compassionate care this place provides to unfortunate raptors who were just minding their business when they got hit by cars or shot.

I never knew so many birds of prey were hit by cars, but that seemed to be the main cause of injury among the birds here, especially the owls.

We arrived just in time for a lecture by one of the senior staffers, complete with show and tell of a vulture, a great barn owl, and a kestrel.  After the lecture, we wandered around the sprawling facilities, which are set back in the woods.  Along the path are many well-conceived ""birdhouses"" where they keep the permanent residents.  The largest enclosure is for the eagles.

Until I visited the Raptor Center, I had no idea that eagles wear sweatpants.  Who knew?  They also have kind of wimpy bird voices.  But they are majestic nonetheless.

This place is well worth the visit not only for the education, but also as a best case example of the exercise of compassion.  Also, if you have kids, take them immediately.  The kids we saw there were really having a great time."
"NC","The Carolina Raptor center is a very quick drive from uptown Charlotte. The center rehabilitates injured raptors from all over the US, but keeps those that are unable to return to the wild. They do a great job with educating visitors about the 'residents'. Visitors can attend hourly shows and walk a trail to learn about the birds. Note: all outdoors

Please cal them if you ever find an injured raptor: 704-875-6521"
"NC","On a recent trip to Charlotte, NC to see the Body World exhibition at the local science museum I took the 20 minute drive up to the Carolina Raptor center.  The center rehabilitates birds of prey that have been injured with the hopes of returning them to the wild but the birds that cannot be returned are kept at the site and cared for in zoo-like aviaries.  The center affords the visitor an opportunity to learn about the birds and see them up close in a way that wouldn't be possible in the wild.  There are several types of falcons, owls, vultures and a family of bald eagles.  The tour around the grounds takes about an hour and there are hourly presentations by volunteers that are geared primarily for children but are fun for adults too.  Definitely worth the trip."
"NC","We are new to the area but really enjoyed our first season w/Strikers.  Super nice office staff & they really seem to love the game & encourage the kids to Have fun & enjoy the game.  The format is slightly different...more like an indoor set up w/the walls but it makes for a faster/always moving game & helps to improve skills at a faster pace."
"NC","I'm a huge supporter of the Strikers' walls for young kids. I have seen how young players develop ball skills quickly with the small walled fields. I find it convenient to have the year round leagues and camps."
"NC","Great location and a lot of good programs offered for little kids just beginning soccer. But, our five year old is currently on the winter league and our experience has not been great. First game, our coach never showed. The schedule for games is not online, or if it is, impossible to find. No instruction or guidance given during the games. But maybe bc its just a winter league? Also, no longer get a t-shirt for registering...we had to come up with our own orange shirt (which we didn't have, so bought one.) Overall, its a good place to start but could be better."
"NC","brought our kitten here after a spay operation became infected.  Original vet sent me away saying 'it's just herpes'.  she spent the night on IV antibiotics but in the end, the infection was too much and we had to put her down.  Through the whole thing everyone was so kind and caring, informative and they listened to me - I cannot say enough about this practice - made one of the worst night/days of my life bearable with their compassion."
"NC","This place saved my pets live! Very friendly, caring, courteous and compassionate staff. Experienced vets. 
This is a great place for exotic pets. Visit Dr. Lauren Powers- she is the best in town and she is the one that saved my pets live (a Netherland Dwarf Bunny Cookie, who after two years is a happy healthy bunny). It was nothing short of a miracle for Cookie to survive a bad infection! Dr. Powers fussed over Cookie every day, called all her Doctor friends for expertize and kept me in the loop.
I saw many customers very happy with the care in this place and many saved lives"
"NC","Beware of this place. We had a mini-dachshund that had a bleeding ulcer. Test after test after test they were still not sure what was wrong with this young 7 year old dog. Ultimately after about $3400 worth of tests they wanted to operate to see if there was something that they were missing. How much? Another $5000. Unfortunately he had already lost too much blood, so surgery was definitely too risky and they knew that. We would up bringing our pup to another vet for a second opinion and the fix was not as invasive or expensive as CVS. Please bring your animal somewhere else! They will make you go broke and play on your feelings. Very sad that there are people out there taking advantage of per owners. To add to this, we have had other friends and family members that have had similar experiences. So yourself and you pet a favor and don't go to these ""specialists""."
"NC","Super qualified professionals who clearly ""Get It"" when it comes to diagnosing your pet's needs without the pressure of feeling like you are being taken to the cleaners as far as your wallet is concerned.  It isn't cheap but what vet is these days? This would be the first place I would return to in a pet emergency. Straightforward & knowledgeable professionals who have a genuine concern for their patients as well as their owners.  Keep it up ladies."
"NC","I brought my dog to Dr Arnold for a initial exam for a torn CCL and to ensure he was ready for surgery. During the visit, Dr. Arnold agreed that it was a torn CCL and then we discussed which surgery to do. We agreed on a surgery and set a date for 3 days after the initial exam. I dropped my dog off at the hospital for his surgery and received a phone call about an hour later from Dr. Arnold. Basically, my dog has an infection and he recommended waiting to do the surgery until the infection was gone. I agreed with him but then was shocked with a $400 vet bill when I picked him up. I felt cheated because I thought the infection should have been something discovered in the initial exam to say he was ready for his surgery. I felt like I should get refunded the money which was only $132 after I was going to spend $3500 total. There reasoning was that it was only a consultation so the doctor didn't really put his hands on him to check him out. My argument to that is that if it is the first time you have ever seen a dog wouldn't you want to check him out thoroughly to make sure there will not be any complications during the surgery. They did agree to refund $40 of the $132 that I felt that they owed me. I have total confidence in Dr Arnold but will not use their services again due to the way they conduct business. There are plenty of great vets around that due surgery. Try somebody else."
"NC","Will never come here again!

My cat has cancer and was experiencing some new symptoms that needed possible ultrasounds. We came to this CVS location because it was after hours and the CVS I usually go to in Matthews wasn't going to have the ultrasound tech as soon as needed, so we drove 30 minutes in the opposite direction to this location in Huntersville.

When we walked in around 10PM on a Friday, the place was packed to the brim. All the exam rooms were full and there were about 10 people in the lobby. Okay, so maybe that night we just had bad luck?

No. Our greeting at the front desk was awful. The secretary didn't even make eye contact with us and acted like we were inconveniencing her. She was appalling and rude. 

We were told we would have to wait at least an hour because they were overly busy, which we understood. After a couple hours, we asked if we could just check our sick kitty into the ICU for the night and leave because we knew she needed overnight supervision.  Well, the secretary didn't even come relay the NO response to us.

Luckily, not all of the staff were as dreadful as the secretary. But we ended up waiting over 5 hours (until 3:30AM), only to be told that they were admitting her into the ICU overnight and running tests (exactly as we requested before). I know the protocol was to have the doctor chat a moment in person before we left, but we felt that common sense wasn't being put to use at this facility."
"NC","Very kind and caring staff. . . Our dog began limping a bit on Christmas eve and by Christmas day we were very concerned that she was not putting any weight on the sore front paw. 

I was worried that there would be some sort of additional ""fee"" charged bc of the holiday / but there was not. We were there for three hours and fifteen minutes (but we know that they were very busy with a lot of other more urgent cases than ours.) We waited about 45 mins for a vet tech to come weigh Lady and check her vitals. They we saw the vet at about the 1 hour and 45 minute mark. 

We agreed to allow the vet to sedate Lady so she could shave her front paw and really get a better look at what was going on / she came back at the two hour and 45 minute mark to say that she suspected an abscess, but after trying to drain fluid out she found the swollen part just swollen flesh and no real pus to drain.

All told, we were there for 3 hours and 15 mins, but I believe that is quite out of the ordinary wait time as they probably had given the holiday off to as many staffers as they could. We were grateful that the staff that was there was very kind and considerate (even gave me a nickle to get a snack out of the machine b/c I was five cents short.)"
"NC","Pricey,but worth it in an emergncy."
"NC","On multiple occasions they were not able to remove stains from the dresses, pants, etc but they charged me for the items. Not happy. I've decided that im not coming back to this place."
"NC","Excellent, full service dry cleaning & alterations  Have been using them for the past six years and have nothing but accolades for them.  If you live in the Stallings area, you should be using them."
"NC","It took us a while to find them but Union Cleaners is the best we have found in the Stallings/Indian Trail/No. Weddington area. Very reasonable pricing. 

Mr and Mrs. Park are absolutely outstanding and they do tailoring on site as well. Dry cleaning is always ready same day or the next.. 

A fantastic locally owned business."
"NC","Very good classic New York pizza. I would highly recommend it. If you want to get the best pizza possible make sure you order light sauce. They tend to over do the sauce sometimes but overall great pizza place."
"NC","Very good pizza!  This is usually our ""go to"" for pizza when the kids aren't around (they prefer Pizza hut) .  Pretty authentic NY Style pizza although a little bit on the pricey side."
"NC","Great place! Good pizza that tastes great and is very authentic! We had a mushroom and sausage and we were very impressed. You won't be disappointed!"
"NC","Best pizza I have ever had."
"NC","I wasted nearly twenty bucks on the driest and most boring white pizza ever! The whole dinner was nothing but a downer. Plus the sample we got was way undercooked, after eating the first slice we decided to bake it for another five minutes.

Once reheated the crust wasn't bad, not soggy or cardboard like but way thick for an alleged NY pizza. The topping unfortunately didn't get any worse or better for it, it was as solid as it was bland.

The only reason I'm giving it two stars rather than just one is that I suspect their plain pizza is better than average for this forsaken area. 

You've been warned: in Matthews-Stallings 5 stars amounts to just average out on in the modern world, and 4 stars here translates to ""it's pretty much crap but we have no better"" ."
"NC","They do take out and delivery! The pizza is tastier than most delivery places. The 10"" is a good size for an individual pizza. The staff was a lot of fun to chat with and answered any questions we had. We will definitely be getting food from them again."
"NC","My family actually prefers this place to other pizza places in the area - or did before they stopped serving the onion rings! This place had some of the best onion rings, but mysteriously, they stopped serving them! 

The pizza here is a lot like NJ/NY pizza. Cheesy with a crisp/bendy crust. The pizza really is very good. The mozzarella sticks are great also. 
Please bring back the onion rings guys!! The meatball and chicken parm. sandwiches are VERY good. Great bread too.( the meatball sub could use a few more meatballs but is still delicious)

We still love ya and will order from you often!"
"NC","I was disappointed that they don't have an online menu.  Of course, after i had placed my order, I did some digging and found one on www.urbanspoon.com 

I got delivery-  they dont do individual slices, so I got the pepperoni mini pizza (8in.) and small side salad.  That wasn't even enough to fulfill the $10 minimum!  $6 Say whaaaa?  So I added breadsticks to make the order $12 including tax.  Perfect portion for one person, slightly greasy, but it's pizza, people!  The breadsticks had this addictive garlic/Parmesan butter mixture that I kept licking off the wax paper (hey! judgement-free zone here!) and the marinara was thick and not too sweet.  Luckily they delivered to my hotel relatively quickly- I felt like I was withering away in my (100 count sheets, I swear!) hotel bed with visions of mocking, dancing pepperoni swirling in my head...

  I would recommend NY Pizza Express for a quick cheap bite.  Next time I will try the calzone."
"NC","some of the best pizza we have had since moving to the area. very very good!! highly recommend."
"NC","First time trying NY Pizza Express tonight, and I am very glad I did! 
Found a menu online to have a look at prices, very reasonable, actually I was surprised at how cheap they were. We order 2 large pies, one just mozz, the other sausage & bacon, for delivery on a Saturday evening. They gave us a 30-40 min time estimate, and were in my driveway no more than 20 minutes later! Good friendly service both on the phone, and from the delivery driver. 
Pizza was great, nice slightly chewy crust, thin, but  not too thin. Good amount of sauce, and cheese tasted very fresh! It was really good. Super happy to have tried this place, now I just need to try their subs, calzones, and everything else! 
Thanks NY Pizza Express!"
"NC","This pizza is mediocre at best. Not really a NY style pizza - the crust is soggy, they finely chop the toppings - definitley not worth getting excited over."
"NC","These guys definitely know how to make a good pizza. The crust is the perfect blend of chewy with a hint of crunch, totally foldable and delicious! Not only do the make a good pie, they do it quickly, even when it's busy, and get it to your door still hot and tasty. They've officially made it into my phone contact list!"
"NC","Take out - No dine in - Friendly staff - Very good Pizza, better than most!  Fast, fast, fast service, great quality, great taste!  Ate here (in there parking lot) Sunday night!

I'm almost sure the Cheese they use is 100% Mozzarella (instead of a blend) I am a Fan of this Pizza with EASE!  If they were located closer to me I would be getting more Pizza from them vs Fuel!"
"NC","The best NY style pizza I've had in NC!  It may seem a little pricey in comparison with Domino's or other pizza chains but you get what you pay for.  Delivery is fast and non-pizza items are good as well."
"NC","I have to defend this local BK as it has gotten of a lot of bad reviews.(not saying they were not called for)
But as of moving to Stallings and having this as the closest quick fast food they are not bad at all.
We have gotten to know the crew, don't know if that helps, but everything is fresh, hot, and never a messed up order. 
The burger buns even look like the commercial and not squished!!
Overall good experience, will return for sure."
"NC","UGH.

Nasty restaurant with nasty food. I can thank BK for ruining my dining plans this past weekend. 

Sometimes when you have kids, you have to eat somewhere to appease them. I used to only go to BK if I was ""stopped up"" and needed a release. Well, that's still definitely the case after eating there Friday night since I made intimate friends with my commode both Saturday and Sunday.

This place is filthy. 

The food is atrocious.

The employees are miserable (one of the cooks....No. the ONE cook was dressed in street clothes-whatever happened to uniforms?).

Your pal,
Walter"
"NC","Either my English muffin sandwich sat under a hot lamp all morning OR Burger King's kitchen staff just decided to deep fry the whole damn thing.  If that's not enough, the sausage smelled of animal decay.

Just awful."
"NC","This is the Burger King that corporate forgot. The food is awful (which doesn't help because BK is generally nasty), service is slow, and the ice maker makes a weird slurping sound....like someones in there. This place has such a lousy reputation that the line around the half gas station McDonalds can be wrapped around twice and no one will wait at Burger King. King Nasty!"
"NC","If you ever thought it was impossible to wait too long in the drive-thru, while you are the ONLY person there.....drop in on this hole in the wall.  It is possible!"
"NC","I'm a car guy and I can spot a fellow car guy and that folks at Tullock are car guys. This family-owned shop is friendly, knowledgeable and most importantly honest. It's easy for mechanics to take advantage of customers that wouldn't know better. These guys don't do that at all. Plus, if you're info older and classic cars, they can do a restoration too. If you're looking for an honest mechanic to help your car last that much longer (as we all are), give Todd a call"
"NC","Todd is a great mechanic good person! His wife was so very nice I have told a lot of people about this place just because of his character! Thank you todd so very much as soon as I get my new hot rod its your to fix!"
"NC","I came to Tullock because my wife and i are big on Yelp. I recently purchased a vehicle after i lost my other car in a recent auto accident. The car i purchased had numerous issues and financially i was in a bind. I came hoping that I'd find a mechanic that was honest and that wouldn't take advantage of me. All i can say is Mr. Tullock went above and beyond his duties to help me. I can't even begin to say how thankful i am for his service! Mr. Tullock is a man of integrity and character! I seldom have ever came across people like him. Not only did i find a mechanic i made a friend! There's no one else I'd even trust my car with! All i can say is my family and i thank him from the bottoms of our hearts! We are in your debt sir! Tullock Automotive is 2nd to none! Hands down best shop in Matthews maybe even in all of North Carolina!"
"NC","I cannot express how pleased I was doing business with Tullock Automotive.  New to the area and not a clue where to take my vehicle for service, I decided to try Tullock Automotive as it was close to where I lived.  I am not very knowledgeable about vehicles and every time I took my car there I never felt taken advantage of.  Todd and his staff are phenomenal.  Not only do they do terrific automotive work, but they are genuinely great people.  I only stayed in the area for a year and a half, but my vehicle visited Todd multiple times (tires, oil changes, O2 censor, accident repair, etc.).  I can honestly say I was disappointed when we were leaving the area because I was saddened to think I had to find someone else to take care of my vehicle as well as Todd and his staff did.  I left there feeling like family, not just some random customer.  Great people who I would always give business to and would recommend to anyone and everyone.  They're 5+ stars, without a doubt."
"NC","When my girlfriend and I moved from NY we had to find someone reliable and trustworthy to work on our vehicles.  Tullock automotive has not disappointed us.  

Todd, his wife and the rest of his staff have been our go to for anything automotive while we have lived here.  Their flexibility, honesty and friendliness are why we keep coming back.  

If you live in the area or not they are worth the drive to check them out.  You will not be disappointed in the service.  Tullock automotive is a great local business in Stallings.  If you have vehicle issues do not hesitate to give them a call."
"NC","I was looking  around for a place to take my car when I came across reading reviews about Tullock Automotive.  Convinced by the reviews I decided to call in.  All I can say was they were absolutely awesome and friendly.  They were able to quickly diagnose the problem of my car and get it done.  I now take my car to Tullock Automotive because I know that I won't get sucked in by some other places that overcharge and don't always do the best job.  It has a very family oriented atmosphere with Todd's wife working there too.    I totally agree with everyone's reviews that Todd and the guys at Tullock Automotive is the place to take your car.   You WILL not be disappointed!!  So happy that I found these reviews helpful!!!  Highly recommended!!!"
"NC","I can't believe how friendly and nice the mechanic named Todd was!! First time visiting there today had a alternator belt that squeals really loudly when I started up the car. Was quite embarrassing and annoying with this problem. So I decided to get it fixed and found this place on yelps with good reviews I had no choice but to go here since I stay down the road and the shop reviews was what I was looking for. Todd came to my assistance as I literally opened that door and took a few steps Into the lobby. Got my car done and right away in under 5 MINS!! Fixed the problem ALSO gave me a deal to help get my AC working when I decide to get it fixed. All I gotta say is I can highly recommend this place. Even though I only visited one time first impressions had me at awe. Ill definitely come back here again!! Hard to find good business like this place  these days.  Thanks! Randy.T"
"NC","I was in Charlotte visiting family over Spring Break when my engine started misfiring.  It was Good Friday afternoon and I was planning to drive back to Chicago the following day. All the auto shops were going to be closed for the holiday weekend, so I knew I had to get it taken care of that day.  I called and spoke to Todd, who told me it might be a bigger job than they had time for, but told me to bring it right over and he'd see what he could do. 
I'm SO glad I brought it there.  Three men worked together to quickly diagnose the problem, go get the part I needed, WASHED the car while they were waiting for the part (just to be nice!!) and solved my problem in about an hour.  The price they charged me was much less than I expected, and I can honestly say it was the BEST car repair experience I have ever had.
Please take your car to these guys with confidence.  There's just no way you'll regret it."
"NC","Zero stars really but that is not an option. After several failed attempts at other dealers i decided to give this place a try to fix some front end noise and shaking on my toyota avalon. First time and 600 dollars later i got new brakes and rotors. Left with car and still had noise and shaking. Called back and Gary the owner told me to return next day. Then it was the drive train and bearings so 2 days and another 1100 dollars later i pick up my car. Low and behold still shaking and return yet again for a 3 rd time and its another thing. Now im 1700 in and almost 3 weeks dealing with this and car still not fixed. So for the 4 th time i called and at this point i just wanted some of my money back. I did not feel it was working out nor should i have to keep returning for the fourth time with the same initial problem. As i tried to explain this is when Gary the owner became hostile and not responsive to my request.  I don't at all see how 2 weeks 3 return trips and 1700 bucks later and you have an attitude with Me? I don't recommend yes they seem nice until you have a problem BEWARE DONT FALL FOR IT"
"NC","This review is long overdue, my apologies to Gary & staff.

They first worked on my 96 Infiniti I30 about 5-years ago and I have done business with them on a few other occasions when needed.  Each time they have been less expensive but not of lower quality and certainly more of a straight-shooting, above the table approach.  I have not been dissatisfied, even when I returned with a concern of the work they had performed, they've made it right each time.  I've taken three vehicles to them over the years, the '96 I30, a '97 Camry, and an '06 Sienna.  I have been thoroughly pleased with economics (by comparison) and quality each time."
"NC","I had an oil leak on my Lexus that would not go away, I am always skeptical when choosing who to trust with my car. Lots of horror stories out there, I just knew my Lexus was going to be crazy expensive to fix and I was expecting the worst.

Then I found Matthews Imports,  after I expressed my concerns to Gary, the shop owner, he personally checked my car over and explained it was not as bad as I thought. 

They fixed the leak the same day,  now I know where to take my car for anything major or small, Everyone there is knowledgeable and personable.      

Matthews Imports,  a real honest auto shop"
"NC","When my car was down and out and I was trying to decide to fix it or junk it, I took it Matthews Imports for a second opinion.  On the phone, it was ""sure, we'll check it out"" and that remark cost me the fee for him to hook it up to his scanner machine.

Dude, I knew the transmission was bad...the car tells you that.  

They did follow up with a couple of options that were slightly less than my normal mechanic but unfortunately, it wasn't what I wanted.  Still I could have gotten over it but the straw that broke the camel's back was when I got into the car, went to close the OBD port and the knee pad was covered in grease.  YUCK!  

They couldn't be nicer people but not for me.  Sorry."
"NC","Purchased a home in June. To my surprise there was no air conditioning on the second floor of my home. Due to the age of the home there were no easy solutions to remedy the problem. After calling on approx. 13 different HVAC companies, they were the only ones that were able to come up with a reasonable solution to fix the problem. They were very professional, courteous and efficient. There price was fair and they fixed my problem. For any AC or Heating needs, I highly recommend them. I will never use anyone else for my HVAC needs!"
"NC","We appreciate so very much the honesty, integrity, and prompt and efficient service provided by Custom Comfort Heating & Air of Matthews, NC.  Custom Comfort has serviced our home for over ten years.  This company provides wonderful service to their customers.  The company operates with ethics and integrity.  You can trust this company and be assured of their best with every service call!"
"NC","We moved to Matthews in 1987 and bought a new house. The heating and air conditioning units had been installed by Custom Comfort. Whenever we have needed repairs or replacements we have used them. They are prompt, their prices are fair and I trust them. They won't try to sell you a replacement unit if your current equipment can be repaired. After 25 years of great service I wouldn't think of calling anyone else."
"NC","It is too bad I can't give this zero stars.  Eat at your own risk!  I had Kung Pao Chicken and got really bad food poisoning.   The chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful. I will never go back here again."
"NC","Not recommended. Szechuan beef tasted like ketchup. Spring roll spongy and tasted bad. Pork fried rice is OK.  My daughter likes the Sesame Chicken but too sweet for my taste."
"NC","This place has the look and feel of the standard, small, family-owned Chinese restaurant (with the light-up grid menu hanging above, one small counter dead center in the room when you walk in, booths along the wall to your left, etc.).  The staff was quite friendly when I walked in and ordered.  As far as the food goes, it was mostly fine. HUGE portions, so if you're a volume eater and crave Chinese food, go for it.  However, from experience ordering a chicken dish from this place, they load it with WAY more vegetables than meat, which was somewhat disappointing.  It's still pretty decent Chinese food.  Their medium-sized portions of noodles and such are enough to last you the day."
"NC","Had a rare only person in the house night, so I decided to treat myself.   

I have passed by the Panda for years, and have always wanted to stop by, but my wife is very picky about Chinese food.   With only me, I had the perfect opportunity.

I stopped in on the way home on Tuesday, July 3rd, to order and go.   Entered, and found really nothing to write home about the interior decor.  But I am of the mindset that if the decor is not great, the food usually is.  (long experiences with Mexican restaurants in the west)

There were several people in the front area, either waiting for their food or waiting to order.  But nobody sitting down.  It was early in the evening, though.

I love General Tso's chicken, and most of the time, it is not that spicy, to appeal to a wider audience. 

I ordered the dinner special, which came with fried rice and an egg roll.   I could see thru to the kitchen behind the counter, and was able to watch as my food was prepared.

It came quickly, and I took it home.  As I was leaving, there were more people coming in.

I got home and grabbed a beer, and got into my order.  And the General Tso's was spicy!!!  The way it should be!!

It was a generous portion, and the fried rice was flavorful.  The egg roll, well it was an egg roll, but I love egg rolls as well!

Be mindful, this was just a review of one dish.  I do have to go back and try more!"
"NC","Best sesame chicken in the world. I travel all the time for work and try lots of Chinese  joints but nothing comes close to this place. Best take out Chinese food hands down that I have ever had."
"NC","Staff made you feel as if they were doing you a favor by waiting on you. Owner on the phone and didn't even acknowledge the customer.  Food was awful. Will never go back"
"NC","Atmosphere aside, the food here was good. Particularly the general tso chicken. It was crispy not soggy like some places. It looks like your typical take out chinese joint so our expectations were not high to begin with but we enjoyed the food and would definitely go back."
"NC","I don't know how this place makes a profit.  The ingredients seem so fresh and prices are very low.  Best pizza crust. 
Cheap lunch specials too"
"NC","I really like this place. I get delivery all the time.  I feel like its better than a lot of other chain pizza places. You can order everything from wings to subs and dessert pizza (never had that) The owner or manager, not sure which one is very nice .  Its located in a strip mall near a Harris Teeter."
"NC","Had their pizza last night for my sons sleepover. None of the kids ate it and complained that it tasted metallic. It was indeed pretty horrible even for $5.99 per medium. We will never go near the place again."
"NC","good pizza, great price, nice guys"
"NC","Well for this being my first stay here with my family and pet. I must say the front desk crew and management are amazing.(Todd & Melissa) Very professional and friendly and helped make our stay a good one."
"NC","(Occurred last summer, just now updating)

Found myself with very simple issue on a ~6-year old unit - exhaust fan (outside) failed.  Very disappointed in response I received from McLintock when I contacted them seeking to purchase replacement fan and install myself.  The representative insisted on $90 service call to determine issue.  Them stood behind some policy that they couldn't sell parts.  I understand to a degree but they've lost a customer due to their insistence on making a buck and lack of willingness to help or direction to solve my issue.  This highlighted how they've tried to upsell me on every visit for the past couple years - I overlooked previously because I have no issue saying 'No.'

I wound up finding a replacement fan online, thru a willing merchant; installed myself and all is well for a year now."
"NC","So far, have only needed their services for bi-annual preventive maintenance/routine checkup but they have been very pleasant to work with."
"NC","From start to finish, the staff and quality of work of McClintock Heating and Cooling was superb.  I highly recommend them, and will rely on them the next time I need a mechanical contractor.

I hired them to run a gas line from an existing meter, up an exterior wall, across the attic, and down to a new gas hookup in the kitchen.  Everything they put in looked great, and the workers did a very good job of being minimally invasive.  I had to do very little patching of my exterior siding, and they even managed to avoid damaging my interior walls.  I was prepared to have to spend a lot of time afterwards patching holes, but I hardly had to do anything.  

Also, everyone on the staff I talked with was very professional and competent.  The workers themselves, the ladies in the office, and every supervisor I encountered was very communicative, and did a very good job of answering my questions and keeping me informed as the job proceeded.  They were even sure to have a supervisor here when the county inspector came by to help answer any questions she may have.

Lastly, I always get several bids when I hire work done on my house, and McClintock's pricing was very competitive.  It was near the bottom of the different bids I received, but their apparent competence and great communication from the get-go made the small price difference more than worth it.   They also accepted payment over the phone and didn't expect any payment until the job was completed and passed inspection."
"NC","I was in need of heating and cooling (at the moment, just cooling) for a room over the garage, and after doing a bit of digging, settled on McClintock for the work.

While many, if not most, service providers will come out and be only too happy to sell you on something, I found that McClintock took the time to examine the space - and measure it! - and then go over a few options.  Before we even determined where to go, they also sent out a technician (probably not the correct term, hope I'm not offending anyone) to make sure that everything would fit.

Since we generally work with our own electrician, they also made sure we had the information for getting everything squared away on that end, and they even mentioned the possibility that the room could have some problems because the ceiling was a bit on the low side, but that they didn't expect it (not being sure if it was originally permitted).

In the end, everything went smoothly, except for the fact that having two different contractors pull permits was a pain, but that is the county's fault, not theirs.  McClintock worked to get the permits finalized, and didn't expect to collect on the final bill until it was all settled.  They even sent their technician back twice to figure out what was rattling around in the unit and causing me to think something was broken.

Everything now works great, which is good as we might need to have them check out the main system in the house soon."
"NC","5 Stars all the way. Front desk attendant ""Christian"" went above and beyond the call of duty. He has a great attitude and is very personable. He is an asset the the Holiday Inn brand. We were grieving the loss of loved one and he was completely compassionate. We can tell he loves his job ! I will always stay at Holiday Inns for now on."
"NC","We traveled to Mt. Holly to attend a death in the family. Luckily I knew where the hotel was located or I would have driven right past the entrance. The parking situation is horrible. The parking layout is poorly designed and I spent far too much time waiting on other guests to park or drive past. The lady at reception did not greet us when we walked up to the front desk. I am an IHC Gold Elite member. The usual offer of bottled water was an after thought and she only offered a single bottle for two guests. There was no hair dryer in the room and when I called the front desk the lady responded as though I was lying. After a few minutes later a member of the housekeeping staff came to my room. She did not greet me as i opened the door. She came in and looked around the room as though I didn't think to look around for the hair dryer before calling the front desk. She did, however, return quickly with a hair dryer. Most of the staff were borderline rude or down right rude. The breakfast area was incredibly crowded. The morning of checkout my bill had not been placed under the door. I opened the door and it was lying in the hallway with my personal information there for anyone interested in reading my bill."

I have to agree with another reviewer in that I am not sure how this hotel qualifies as an airport hotel.

I booked this hotel stay for a business (military) event. We had scheduled a team-building group event at the US National White Water Center and so I searched for hotels around that area. When I saw this hotel featured as an airport hotel I figured it would be in a safe enough location with some close-by eateries and quick highway access, etc...

We booked a total of 13 rooms with them and checked in individually. I had been in contact with one of their hotel managers. I was a little dissatisfied in how poorly I welcomed to the hotel. 

The front desk clerk seemed ""oh-so enthused"" to be working that night, and when I let her know that I had been in contact with the manager and just wanted to make sure everything was in good standing, she went in the back, he was there, and never even came out to greet me.

Now I didn't expect any VIP treatment. But usually when you organize a group event at a hotel you are give a very warm welcome. I know this because this wasn't a first for me.

I had requested a room with a crib (only two months in advance, with a reminder the day prior), and when I requested one that night, yes the same clerk, took over an hour to get it. At first I wasn't even sure if she was going to because she never did give any indication she was paying attention to me at all.

The cable and internet did not work our first night there. No apologies were issued.

The room had a musty smell to it. I have a family of five (2 adults, 2 kids, and one baby) but they only had 3 towel sets in the room...even the next day after housekeeping came.

The hotel was not in the best of locations, it was secluded and not close to anything, and price-wise you could find better closer to downtown. I am not from Charlotte, NC and had only been there once...and again I figured ""airport"".

The hotel interior was nice and they did have a complimentary hot breakfast from served until 0930 am (another fact of information I had to PRY out of the front desk clerk). 

The staff working the morning shift were much more pleasant and inviting. 

The hotel was very quiet at night which we appreciated. The doors did not slam, thank God, as our baby girl is a very light sleeper. The hotel itself is clean and kept nice. It was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express.

I rated poor because of the customer service but overall I would give it a three (average). However, I would not book here again not mainly due to my experience but due to the location. There are better hotels averaging the same distance from the USNWC but in better areas.

If anyone from management every reads this, please take a look into ""Deborah"" the front desk jerk...I mean clerk.

Stayed July 2011, traveled on business"
"NC","Everything was great except that the water in the shower WOULD NOT heat up, ever, rendering it unusable. I ended up taking a sponge bath with the aid of the sink. 
To be fair we didn't tell the staff because it was late at night and weren't too keen on switching rooms or having some maintenance guy come up."
"NC","This is a partial review of their breakfast. I visited relatives who were staying there. They felt it was adequate. Now.. on to the food or lack there of. Apparently I'm not the only one who visits guests? It seems I missed the trough by two seconds extremely early in the morning. Huh? I sipped my coffee at 8am and smelled the left over aroma of what might have been bacon. Boo. Oh well. I couldn't even get close to the trough for the amount of people eating off the last shred of food that remained. 

I have stayed at Holiday Inn in Texas numerous times. I'm sure the food is all the same provided by the same vendor. 

Good luck on your stay. I'll fight you for that last piece of bacon."
"NC","Great Mexican at a great price. Margaritas are awesome too. Servers are polite and service is quick. This is our go-to place for Mexican around the gaston county area."
"NC","Got carnitas.. good food, large portions.. service was o.k.  I wish it was more authentic.. I'm use to L.A. authentic mexican food..  looking for homemade salsa, mexican cheese and handmade tortillas!!"
"NC","Now I'm not saying this is a five star restaurant, but you do get what you pay for. The food is inexpensive for such big portions, especially if you order any of the nacho plates. I've never had any problems with the service at this place."
"NC","This place looks like a whole in the wall but Very good food, very good atmosphere, very good service. Waiters were very attentive and funny. So far my favorite mexican restaurant in charlotte. My family is from the west coast and this is the closest taste to it. The one thing I can't get use to is all mexican restaurants in charlotte use ground beef instead of shredded beef. Because of that I gave them 4 stars. Please make it an option even if its at a higher cost.. It really makes a difference. Overall great place."
"NC","Great food! awesome Margaritas!"
"NC","For tasty, quick ,and cheap Mexican food this is the place. There aren't many restaurants in this area, so if we're looking for something close to home that won't take all night or break the bank  El Valle fits the bill. 

The servers have always been polite, efficient and accommodating. It surprised me that someone else said that they received terrible service here (FWIW I have never seen any female servers - maybe it was a different restaurant?). 

I love their pico that comes with the salsa and chips you get as soon as you're seated, and their pitchers of margaritas are tasty and fairly cheap."
"NC","Worst service in the area, by far.   Once we were seated, it took the waitress 25 minutes to make her way to our table to take our drink order.  We finally decided to settle up 45 minutes after placing our order.   The food never made it to our table.   I have eaten at this restaurant before and  the service wasn't so bad.   The food is generally pretty good.  If you want to order Chicken, definitely get it shredded."
"NC","We were in Mount Holly doing some Christmas shopping and used Yelp to find lunch. Thanks to all of the great reviews we have found a little gem! The food is simple, no frills, basic drive in fare, but everything was so fresh. They were pretty busy, so food took a little time to come out. It was worth it, though. A great place to take the family."
"NC","Brightstar is the classic drive-in burger joint. No frills (unless you count the radio station and chess/checkers board) but decent service and fantastic food! You gotta get the lotta burger!! It almost appears closed at first glance, but pull in and head inside and give them a chance! You won't be disappointed!"
"NC","It's like Happy Days, without Richie and The Fonz. Great burgers, great fries, and diet sundrop on tap. No place else like it. Oh, and a radio station broadcasting 50's and 60's hits from the diner too. If you're lucky, they'll play a request for you. Love this place when i'm in Mt. Holly or Belmont."
"NC","Burger was great! Fresh meat and great bun. Fries and onion rings were average. Ice cream was a bonus for my kid. Would definitely come back for a burger again!"
"NC","Salad bar was simple but delicious. The lotta burger was a must try! The salad bar also came with fresh pizza. Super nice staff and nostalgic feel made this a great treat after our mega jump!"
"NC","Great BBQ plate, amazing slaw on burger. So glad I found this place right near my house."
"NC","went there with my fiance and the food was not at all what i expected from the reviews.
we got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries. 
the bun was deflated and soggy. the burger meat itself looked promising but was burnt and vastly overcooked.. 

SAVE your money on the chili cheese fries. at $3.99, you get maybe two handfuls of their fries with two small spoons of unidentifiable meat (pork? beef?!) and cheese sauce that you get for your nachos at the gas station. 

they do have their own radio station with great music, and fun books to read while you wait. regrettably the food was just not what we were expecting, and it is such a shame."
"NC","We were very hungry and had just spent the day at the US National Whitewater Center nearby.  Didn't really know what to expect from this old Drive In Restaurant.  It looked old inside but what do you expect from an older drive in.  That's where the old stopped.  Food was great.  My son and I ate the LottaBurger with Cheese and all the toppings.  It was delicious.  Meat was nicely seasoned and the cole slaw on the burger added a different taste.  My wife had a barbecue sandwich which she also enjoyed.  Onion rings were very good. If you've had a long day out at the Whitewater Center this is the perfect place to end it."
"NC","Thought it was a joke when I arrived at the Maps address, but drove in the driveway anyway.  Nice surprise!  Lottaburger plate with Tots, slaw on the burger, and a pepper on the side with drink $8.  Oldies (60s-80s?) radio station.  Free WiFi (ask for the password).  Friendly lady at the counter."
"NC","Great Food!

You have to love the lota burger for sure.. but the bbq sandwich is killer, and a better salad bar than alot of larger places.."
"NC","This is a treasure from the past!  From the moment you drive up to the original drive-in and come into it's checker board floored dining room you are transported back to a time when food wasn't just processed and slapped onto a plate.  We ordered different versions of the burgers and fries and were treated to a taste from the past.  The fresh meat burgers (never frozen) were seared on a red hot flat-top until they were crispy around the edges and juicy in the middles.  Homemade slaw and chili covered my masterpiece, and the 1st bite sent me straight back into the days when life was simpler and food was awesome.  I can't say enough about this place, but will add that the hand scooped Mooresville ice cream and in-house ""rock n' roll"" radio station were the icing on the cake.  Can't wait t go back."
"NC","Very good burgers,wife had the BLT and loved it.Nice simple little place."
"NC","Living near the  Brightstar, convenience brings us in more than anything.  My favorite is the salad bar, which is small, but always fresh, and seems to have all my favorite ingredients.  A+ on the salad.  Lunch includes pizza buffet with the salad bar, but they rarely have more than one or two choices of cold, bland pizza.  We recently had a philly which was on special for lunch, and the flavor was great, but the sandwich was    very small.  My wife, who is not a big eater, was still hungry when we left.  This place has a lot of untapped potential when it comes to the food.   The staff is friendly, but there is very little table service.  This place is OK for convenience, since Mount Holly has little to offer food-wise, but don't go out of your way to get here."
"NC","When you just want a good old fashion cheeseburger, you have to go with the LottaBurger from Brightstar, nothing fancy, but a great burger.  Reminescent of soda shoppes and grills of years past.  Just about the same price as a combo at Wendy's or McDonald's, but so much better."
"NC","If you crave a little nostalgia, Brightstar Drive-In is a throwback to a simpler, more neighborly time. 

The menu is pretty simple: The LottaBurger that made them famous, pizza, onion rings, tater tots and the like.

What I love about Brightstar, though, is the escape it provides from chain restaurants and Charlotte's ""Fisher Price"" design. Tucked in a quiet wooded lot in Mt. Holly, the place reminds me of burger joints I visited near my grandparents' camp in New York's southern tier as a kid.

Grab a deck of cards, a few friends, and head out to Brightstar for an evening. It's not too far from the Belmont Drive-In Theatre, so you could make a true throw-back experience out of it."
"NC","By far the best burgers in Mount Holly!   Cowboy pickles (dill) and Cowgirl pickles (sweet) are awesome.   The renovation has added plenty of room.   Try the grilled pimento cheese sandwich also, out of this world!"
"NC","you'd walk right by if if you're not careful. Sake Express 2 Japanese Steakhouse & Seafood please! In fact everything on a skewer! Beer all around. A great place for late night snacking with friends, and it's kinda near times square so you know all the trains stop there. Yes Bourdain stopped here, and yes you should get everything on a stick. You won't regret it."
"NC","Went there last night, great concept, good looking food ... Tasteless and bland."
"NC","For japanese fast food, I love it. I can run in, order, head out pretty quick. The staff is friendly. If you want to eat the place has always been really clean. I just wished they deliveried!  :))"
"NC","Good food at a reasonable price.  It is a small quaint restaurant.  I like it better than their fancy Belmont location.  The food there has a different taste.  They have a friendly staff and the food is worth the value."
"NC","Went right after lunch rush so it was a little messy, however the manager in charge was great.  Yes, they did forget my kids milk and toys, but gave it to me and apologized. I'm not a huge mc d's fan bcuz of health reasons, so I gave it a 3 but service was a 4."
"NC","I've been to it a few times over the years, and I've never had a major issue with this store. I tried the new Chicken Bacon Wrap and it was tasty. If in the area and hungry, I would return."
"NC","Stay away. Since my review nearly a year ago, this place has gone from bad to worse. Every order is wrong. The problem exists at both the ordering process in the drive through, but also in the order picking by staff even if the order was right. How sad. This is the worst McDonald's and worst customer service of any restaurant in any category. Here's what to expect:

Long lines
Rude customer service that claim its the customer's fault
Incorrect orders every time
Cold fries

This is one of the restaurants I worry about that spits in food that retaliate insteed of fixing problems. They have added convenient waiting stations for your car to park so that they can hopefully match the order with the car. Too bad even then the orders are not right. What's worse? Nothing changes even when they aren't busy. 

Avoid this location."
"NC","It's MCDONALDS! You wanted a review.. Ok keep your panties on... here it is...

The place is always slammed (yay for fast food).. You think going into a drive-thru is fast.. It's not. Make sure you check your order as it often comes back wrong - the place is run by 16-19 year olds I swear to god. 

It's a clean place. Well there's something.. It's fast food so you don't have to cook - although I don't know why I'm saying fast in anything because they are not here.. Lastly, it's on the way through Mt. Holly on the way to 85. 

And that's your 20 second review.. I warned ya."
"NC","My friends and I had breakfast at this restaurant Sunday.  The exterior of the establishment is by no means an indicator of the quality of food or experience.   The omelette and potatoes were generous in portion and delicious.  Service was superb.  A good old home country feel.  Inexpensive too!"
"NC","I just had breakfast at the Lowesville Cafe and it was amazing!!!  It is under a new owner and they have redone the entire place.  It looks amazing inside and out.  The food was absolutely fresh and delicious!!  They cook everything from scratch and it was delivered to my place at the counter piping hot!!  The sweet tea was fantastic.  It's such a cool place!  Please plan your route to check out this great place!  It's perfectly rustic with an incredibly friendly staff full of Southern charm!  Do yourself a favor and do what I did...plan your day around a visit to the Lowesville Cafe!!"
"NC","We stayed for my best friends 21st, we got yelled at for having more than 2 people in the room (there were 4 people in a suite...) and for being ""loud"" when we were having casual conversation at 11pm. It's not worth the outrageous amount of money and they are NOT accommodating what so ever, don't waste your money. The manager came and yelled at us himself. If you feel like being disrespected, stay at this hotel. We certainly won't be back"
"NC","Pretty lobby, but had problems with the hotel staff.  We held a meeting there and had no problems with the room, the AV or the catering.  However, as a guest, I would not go back.  

The lobby is pretty, but the room did have a smell to it.  

The internet connection in my room was intermittent and when I called, I was told, ""I don't know what you want me to do about it . . ""  She didn't offer any ideas for help and was quite frankly, rude.  I had the same problem on my laptop, iPad and iPhone.  It wasn't me.  

I asked to take a muffin from the restaurant into the meeting room and, at first, they didn't want to let me - at all.  When they did, they charged me for the full buffet.  

Others in our group had problems as well."
"NC","Clean and welcoming... For cheaper rates, book through Hotwire. Only thing I didn't like is whatever they cleaned with -- it was a bit much and had an overwhelming smell when I would walked into the hotel."
"NC","The lobby is nice and the pool, fitness room are good. Some floors look a bit dated although rooms are just like other Sheratons."
"NC","Staff are great - friendly and helpful. Beds are hit or miss. Some beds are noticeably  older and squeak horribly. Some are as comfy as could be. As usual, Sheraton pillows are amongst the best. Restaurant, bar, pool, and lobby are nice as well."
"NC","Just had to yelp out because the manager was so nice and helpful to me and my mother not just one but two times today.  The staff is obviously making an effort in the area of customer service.  Hotel is up to date, clean and very close to airport.  Oh, yes, must say though that the air freshener issue broached by others is a valid issue.  Yuck!"
"NC","The good:  The staff in the evening at check-in were friendly and helpful.  After getting stuck in Charlotte due to weather in Chicago, we were able to book this hotel for our unexpected stay.  As a nursing mother I was hoping for a fridge in my room, however a pageant taking place at the hotel meant all were taken.  The staff were nice enough to let me keep some things in the employee fridge which I really appreciated.

The beds are very comfortable so you can get a good night's sleep.

The food at the main restaurant/bar was decent with very large portions.  In typical southern style, it was covered in sauce(s) but good enough.

The not so good:  The main picture posted on Yelp (and on SPG.com) leads you to believe the hotel is nicer than it actually is.  The hotel is very average and does not appear to have been significantly updated in the last 10-15 years (except for the beds which were quite nice).

The website advertising a 24-hour on-demand shuttle, however the on-demand part is only when being picked up from the airport not to be dropped off (which would have been helpful for them to mention at check-in).  There were 3-5 of us that were ready to go at 5:45am (because our flight departed at 6:50am) but were told that we had to wait until 6am because it only leaves on the half hour.  They also would not let us ride with an earlier van that carried crew members and informed us that a taxi would take 15-20 minutes to call.  Overall, seemed frustrating as to why they could not have a van make a trip to the airport when there are 5 people waiting to go.

I'm not sure if this is an SPG systematic problem or not, but the hotel charged me for internet on my bill and I had to ask to have it taken off (since I'm a platinum member).  This has happened at several hotels, and I feel they are trying to pass through charges and hoping that guests don't notice."
"NC","This hotel looks a lot better than it smells. The lobby has the stench of too much cheap air fresher and the rooms, furnished in the 1970s faux wood motel style, carry the unpleasantly musty stink of the unconcealed carpet stains. 

My room overlooked a dreary parking lot but on the bright side, the Internet was relatively quick and the hotel is minutes from the airport and the interstate. There are no decent food options within walking distance. 

Charlotte is such a nice town, this hotel and its environs won't do your trip justice. Surprised that this meets the Starwood standard."
"NC","Starwood Hotels, you really let us down. We booked this hotel to stay during an overnight layover in Charlotte. We arrived at the hotel via the courtesy van. While the front desk girl and shuttle guy were pleasant, that's pretty much the only thing I can say were positives of this experience. 

First, our room reeked of incense (FYI, non-smoking also includes pot smoke). Next, we went down to the lobby area to eat dinner. When we tried to order, we were told that they were ""out"" of both items we requested. Then, the items we did order tasted like the equivalent of a Stouffer's microwave dinner and the dessert was rubbery and a waste of money.

Next, in the morning, when we went to get ready, we had to bathe in our own dirt because the shower drain was clogged. I literally filled the tub with shower water that didn't go down all the way until we were almost ready to check out. That's just nasty!

When we got downstairs my husband asked an employee if they had a kiosk to check in for our flight (many hotels have this now). He said they didn't but directed us to the business center to print our passes via their computer. He failed to mention that the printer wasn't working. So I went through the whole thing for nothing. 

I typically don't pay for or book hotels through full-price sites (in this case spg. com) but we wanted to make sure we were super close to the airport and up until this experience I had always had all positives to say about Starwood Hotels (owners of Sheraton, Westin, W, Four Points, etc.).  We paid about $200 for the room before taxes and fees and I won't ever do that again. I had a better stay at a Holiday Inn off Hotwire for $85!

 Also, once again, no free WiFi...which pretty much puts this on the no-go list!"
"NC","Not bad.  Large and tasteful lobby, small but fun indoor/outdoor pool and seating area.  Rooms were nicely appointed and everything seemed clean and in order.  The staff was very friendly and the free airport shuttle kept to its schedule (every 30 mins).  However, there is nothing around except a Shell gas station.  No restaurants or bars except the hotel ones (which close at 12am)."
"NC","The staff was friendly and helpful. That's the only reason this place gets a star. After 10 hours on the road we stumbled in here thinking, how bad can a Sheraton be? Answer: pretty bad! A huge number of kids were staying here for a soccer tournament. No one appeared to be supervising these children who ran screaming through the lobby and restaurant/bar area for entire evening. Actually they were also running and yelling in and out of elevators and hallways, too! It was a tired person's worst nightmare. The room was clean, but the carpeting was terribly stained and the furniture scratched. The bed was, thankfully, comfortable. Just to finish things off, the bill slipped under the door that night was totally wrong. I'd say, skip this one. You can surely do better!"
"NC","Updated:  12/17/12

The Good:  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The front desk was very friendly (Lindsay at the front desk has been particularly friendly and helpful) at check-in and the restaurant staff were also very nice.  The room was clean and well kept with a ~24"" flat TV and decent furniture.  The breakfast  has been improved since the last time.  The potatoes were much better than before and the eggs were done on a per order basis when it wasn't busy.  The bacon and was quite a bit better.

The Not So Good:  Dinner was decent but still left a bit to be desired as far as seasoning and interesting flavors to their dishes.  They would do well to get a little more variety of beers on tap as well.  Yes it is a hotel by the airport but I've stayed at several hotels this lose to airports and they generally have better windows to isolate some of the noise.

Overall, this was a good hotel.  I think the room is among the better quality ones in the area and, provided you're a sound sleeper when it comes to noise, it is pretty comfortable."
"NC","This is a decent hotel.  Decent for a quick over-nighter if you've missed a flight.  But it's not good for longer stays or repeat visits.  The building itself needs updating.  The food at breakfast is OK. But lunch/dinner is like bar food.  Half of the floors don't have vending machines.  One of the floors that does does not offer drinks.  One machine that offered drinks keeps your money without providing a drink.  The other working machine is all out of stock.  Bottled water in the room is $4.00 (before they tack on other BS charges).  Internet access is $9.95 per day.  3G reception in the building is horrible too!  It's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable.

I'd recommend staying somewhere else if you can!"
"NC","I get really annoyed with these ""fancy"" hotels who don't offer the refrigerator and microwave in their standard rooms, which I can get at a Holiday Inn Express or a Comfort Inn for probably half the price.  

Also, for the love of all things holy, don't charge people for WiFi in 2011 after they already paid you an arm and a leg for a room that isn't worth it.  That is RIDICULOUS.

There's at least a half-mile walk (without a sidewalk) to anything except a small convenience store.

The room was comfortable enough, but no greater than any 3-star hotel I've ever stayed in."
"NC","Lobby, restaurant, bar and internet area all look great and new! Room Service was great, fast and efficient. Check in was good, not great! They charge for internet service in the room, that's so 2008!

This is a typical 80 style building that was retrofitted and remodeled. So The main structure, bathroom and HVAC systems all pose a ongoing problem, no matter the extensive renovation.

From a cleanliness perspective the room had spider webs around every corner of the ceiling."
"NC","Nice hotel, clean rooms, OK food. I would visit again."
"NC","Perfect airport hotel.  Decent rooms, starting to age but still not bad.  Not easy to get to or find so look for the large gas sign. But if you do, they have a small pool and a large lobby.  Perfect place to hang out if your tired of your small room.  Food is okay but nothing fantastic in my three stays there."
"NC","This hotel was ok, the Host -Quntin was great., the room took a while to heat up. and the food was good and alot ( dinner). the cheapest thing on the menu was $12.00. The room was wonderful other then the heat part. When it was time to get up the breakfast food was bad. bacon was cooked to hard, the eggs were hard, the fruit was the only thing they could not mess up. that cost me $15.00 (not happy) I went here because my flight got bumped and the next flight was not until the next day. ( not happy). When i went to the bar for dinner they had hockey on and i ask could they change the channel to CNN OR SOMETHING else the guy said no !! all 6 of the tv had to stay on that channel it was a wiring problem."
"NC","I arrived late-ish, tired from a grueling trip and emotionally bruised from an encounter with a rental car company, and immediately I was in good hands. Kind and friendly front desk people took care of me, going the extra mile. Beautiful lobby, excellent room (impeccably clean), great wings at the bar (open late!), patient servers, and just an overall feeling of comfort and wellbeing.  Lovely bed, hot shower, in-room coffee pot, freshly renovated...go stay there. I would. 

Highly recommend. Only faint issue:  would have loved free wi-fi. Not a deal-breaker, though. I like Starwood Hotels, of which this is one."
"NC","Belk at Carolina Place always has amazing customer service. They often compensate when you forget a coupon at the register."
"NC","The recently remodeled Belk at Carolina Place is looking pretty fantastic.  I am a long time Belk shopper, and their red dot sales, along with regular sales, always make me happy.  

The shoe department has been expanded, but I still find that a bit of a crowded mess.  For shoe shopping, I would try to come at an off time so you can get some elbow room and assistance.  I had great luck in the women's department last night and came out with a shopping bag full of capri pants, skirts and shirts for summer.  The store seems much brighter and inviting than before and they are definitely deals to be had.  The young lady that assisted me was very nice and helpful.  I will definitely return (again and again)."
"NC","For whatever reason, I do not end up shopping at Belk all that often, but when I have ended up there (or here, at any rate), I have to agree with Tracy - I end up wandering pretty aimlessly and generally do not end up finding much.

I have always associated Belk with a higher quality of merchandise, and while they do have some good selections on particular items (the number of bowties they have in particular is unbelievable), it is thrown about pretty haphazardly. Not terribly conducive to be able to helping you on your way."
"NC","Its a decent Belk, but really South Park's is the best in the area and sets the bar high so the others just fall a bit short in comparison.  Sales associates are nice, there is always plenty of parking, but I tend to wander and not really find the brands I am looking for and don't buy anything.  Which I guess isn't always a bad thing?"
"NC","Ive been a customer for years and i went there today amd my chicken sandwhich i ordered it was completely frozen i took it back and they made me a new one with no sauce on it and it was completely dried out and over cooked. And the guy wanted to argue back. Im never going back."
"NC","I had the garlic parmesan wings and they were really good. The service was great and quick, I was recommended this place and will recommend to someone else. I'm looking forward to trying their other wing flavors."
"NC","I reviewed TLC back in Feb., and you can read that one for yourself. I complained about the attitude and attention given the customers which was so bad I didn't want to go back. If I can speak plainly about their faults, then when they do good, I feel it should be noted as well. I've been several times now here in Sep. and Oct., and the teenagers are gone. There's an adult running the kitchen now, and a mature, helpful person on the register, and I'd like to think my earlier review had something to do with making these changes. The wings are still the best around, and now its a treat to go in and pick up some delicious wings (which are done when promised), and promptly be served, waited on, and out the door in a hurry. I don't try many flavors because the terriaki is just the BOSS, but my wife likes the honey BBQ, and I'm sure the rest are equally good. The problems seem to be worked out on the service, and their wings were always the best, so I can recommend that you even go out of your way to try the wings at TLC, and feel confident in saying you won't be disappointed!!"
"NC","I used to love this place for the wins and the staff. But I'm not sure if they sold or just changed staff around, but the wings are still great the service as far customer service and management can be worked on.

Tips:Cajun ranch and calypso are great even on the tenders. And the fried mushrooms are awesome. Don't waste your time not  the pizza though"
"NC","This business has been here for several years, and how its survived I'll never know. The kids that are employed here must get paid next to nothing, cause every time I get up the nerve to try them again, its a whole new crew. Each seems to sass and ignore the customers worse than the last crew did. The wings are good, and I guess its just the fact that there's no competition that they make enough to stay open. This place would kill if the staff just PRETENDED to care about customers. Example: Last time I ordered wings, I knew they would take FOREVER, so I didn't even leave my house for a while. Then when I got there, I was waiting and wanted to pay my bill so I could leave when they got ready. Couldn't do THAT!!!! Had to finish cooking them to release the ticket so she could ring it up. So, they must have waited to start them until I got there, 'cause it was well over ten minutes later when they finally came to the front. (WTF?, WHY CALL AHEAD?????) Then, she was busy helping other people that must not have been able to read a menu, or understand english, and it took several minutes more for her to get my money, so I COULD FINALLY GET MY CARCASS OUT OF THAT PLACE!!!. EVERY time I've been in this place, must be a dozen by now, its been some sort of ""Don't give a flying +++"" attitude that just insults me to the point I don't want to come back. Presently, I have a STRONG hankering for some of their wings, but it just hasn't been long enough that I'm willing to go back."
"NC","It's very simple. These are ""some"" of the best chicken wings around. I said ""some"" since I have not tasted a large number of establishments that serve them. I'm selective when it comes to wing sauce, and favor the vinegar based "" tangy"" sauces. TLC's ""Red Tang""sauce it my favorite. Just the right amount of heat for me. For those of you who love to show off how hot you can stand it, there is a hotter sauce. I know this because it's called ""X-tra"" hot.  The inside of the restaurant is small and basic. The young lady who runs the register is very congenial and is quick to tell repeat customers how much she appreciates them. I order all ""drummies"" and the amount of meat on each one of those is more than just about any other wing place that I've tried, however ""Sticky Fingers"" (Ballantyne) has the same amount of meat as ""TLC""."
"NC","I've been a longtime loyal customer of this place (2005). My husband and I just called to order delivery and the girl that answered the phone hung up on him. When I called back she told me ""that wasn't me, it must've somebody else. "" When I spoke to the ""manager"" he said they weren't delivering tonight.  On Super Bowl Sunday.  A wing place.  Not delivering.  Ok. I don't need to spend my money there."
"NC","I love these wings!!!

There are so many flavors here....and I've enjoyed a lot of them...like, Hot, Barbecue, Cajun, Lemon Pepper and Spicy Garlic Parmesan and I have not been disappointed yet! 

Each wing is juicy and full of flavor, they are always hot and made to order ..SOOOO amazing! 

Yes...they have more than just wings....like pizza, subs and fries...but I've only had the wings AND trust me YOU are going to want to try these wings...again and again!!!

In my opinion, these are the best wings in town!"
"NC","This is my favorite Wing place, whether I go in person or have my food delivered. The owners are nice and so are those they have working with them. Even when they have forgotten something on my order during a delivery, they made sure to bring it back promptly. I think they are very accommodating."
"NC","Our office recently placed an order from TLC Wings & Grill.  While they have a huge selection of wings and sauces,  I wasn't really in the mood for chicken wings.  Instead, I opted for the Chicken Parmesan sub ($5.29) with a side order of fries ($1.89).

The chicken parm sub wasn't the smartest  choice for a take-out -- by the time the food arrived, the sauce had sort of soaked into the bread and made it a bit squishy. 

However, the flavor was very good and the portion size was huge (thankfully it was already cut in 2 - definitely enough for 2 meals!)  The fries were good, and they were very generous with the portion size of that as well. 

I would definitely order this again, but probably not for take-out.   I would also recommend giving these guys a try if you are looking for good quality wings & fries at reasonable prices."
"NC","I had lunch at TLC Wings on a Saturday about 1 pm.  There was only one other person inside when I came in.  I ordered 10 wings, hot, and a basket of fries.  I got my drink and sat down to wait for my food.  They had a football game on the flat screen TV.   It took about 20 minutes to get my food.  The sauce on the wings was very good, typical Buffalo style sauce.  The wings themselves were a little over cooked, but still OK.  The fries were good, but they put a seasoned salt on which I would have them leave off next time.  Overall this is a nice place and I would have given a more stars, but a 20 minute wait for 10 wings and fries is ridiculous.  My recommendation, skip eating in here and order your wings to go."
"NC","This is my favorite wing place.  The owners are really nice and they are very accomodating if you have any special instructions for your wings.  Lots of flavor combinations.  This is a place where you want to place your order to go.   I suggest the Red Tang flavor.  Yum !!  They are also now doing Pizza although I've never tried it.

"NC","I too don't understand the low ratings for this place. As others have said you've got to keep your expectations in perspective when visiting a mall food court. For a quick and tasty fast food experience I really love Sarku Japan. They do cook the food fresh to order and I usually order their Teriyaki chicken special. Their teriyaki isn't too sweet which I like and it carmelizes on the chicken for a really great flavor. Because I'm a big guy who likes to eat I get the double meat, spring roll and drink combo. All this for just over $10. In my book and palate I think this is a pretty good deal."
"NC","I don't understand the super low reviews on here, eat here quite often, it's delicious, and fresh, they cook to order.  For mall Asian-style food, you can't beat it!"
"NC","sick...and not in the way my college roommate use to say ""that's sick! "" (meaning cool, awesome, sweet, wicked (variation of any of the previous). No this was just gross. 

After driving across town to two different malls to find a particular dress in my size, I worked up quite the appetite. Hey it's Friday- I'll go for some Americanized Asian...so I ordered the general Tso's with a maki roll ( not sushi- this is what they call their spring rolls), and noodles.

My noodles were cold...like really cold. The portion was beyond stingy- normally with these kind of take-out restaurants I cannot finish my meal, but their were exactly 11 pieces of chicken 7 of which were teeny-tiny bits... The texture of both meat and noodles was very mushy and overall not so tasty. When I paid with debit the girl at the counter literally handed my receipt and said ""sign-this"" ...so much for service. I will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible. 

I should have known better than to give into mall food cravings...not worth the calories. But hey on a positive note I did find my dress size at CP Mall!"
"NC","I feel like all Sarku's taste the same, chicken is good and overall everything is pretty unsalty. However, one of my broccoli's had black stuff on it, and I'm pretty sure it was dirty, not charred.

Hm... well it WAS $5.65 after tax for a huge plate."
"NC","Clean, great staff good subs, even better that it right beside Starbucks. They also now take Apple Pay."
"NC","Delicious food (hook and ladder is my favorite). They are quick.  Plenty of space to eat inside or outside. 
GREAT service!"
"NC","The customer service here is amazing! I called on a Saturday with an impromptu lunch order for 18 box lunches. Lakeisha, the awesome employee that answered the phone didn't flinch when I said I needed the lunches in an hour. 

I arrived an hour later and everything was ready and organized. My HOA volunteers thank you and we'll be back...with more notice next time"
"NC","I never much cared for Firehouse in the past. But, they are quickly becoming a top contender on my list of sub creators.

This location recently reopened after a short remodeling stint which has, as a result, increased in square footage allowing for more tables and chairs.

The ladies are very pleasant towards customers, which is much appreciated and hard to find in todays society. 

The service is quite fast even during the super busy lunch phase. That's a plus when most of us need to travel to/fro and eat all within an hours time.

Along with that fast service comes fresh delicious sandwiches. Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. You'll enjoy it. 

Although not a fan, this is location is equipped with the futuristic Coke Freestyle beverage contraption."
"NC","Great subs, usually fast service.  The hot sauce selection is the best part though.  They will even sell full bottles which is good as the grocery stores around here have very limited selections."
"NC","Average sub shop with above average subs. Their hot sauce selection can add even more heat to their primarily hot sub menu. Sandwich sizes are satisfying and service is fast enough even when busy."
"NC","In the past when my husband and I needed to purchase good quality furniture we always went to Walter E Smith in the Chicago area.  Since living here we made the change to Ethan Allen.  We purchased a full living room from them this past spring and have been very happy with almost everything.  The service was great and the sales person listened to us and put together exactly what we wanted with one exception.  We asked for tables (specifically a coffee table) that could stand up to some abuse because we have a 16 month old at home.  The table he recommended is beautiful but does not at all stand up to what he said it would.  This table is only 3 1/2 months old and already has wood chipping off, many many dents and looks absolutely horrible.  This table is so softI can dent/scratch it with my fingernail.  Ive have better quality tables from Target and World market for 1/3 the price.  After only 2 months use I called the store to tell them the sales clerk clearly did not know the product he was selling, if he did he never would have recommended this table.  I was told they did not cover customer abuse and can't be held accountable for a sales person giving me bad information.  It's the sylvan coffee table....DO NOT BUY IT!!  I dropped the remote control on it and it left a huge dent.  They wouldn't even offer to come out to see if the table was defective or had the wrong finish.  I told them I would bring it in myself and they said no.   My end tables and cocktail table are extremely durable/well made and are exactly what I wanted.  I am disappointed the table I was most concerned about is horrible."
"NC","Service was terrible!! My sister and I walked in this location and were not even greeted with an hello. As we browsed through the store 2 of the sales associates went in the opposite direction when they saw us coming. On our way out of the store both associates were at the front of the store shouting goodbye. I proceeded to tell them I noticed we were intentionally being ignored, how rude they are, and that discrimination is completely wrong. I also so let them know their actions are the perfect way to get bad reviews for the store.
My sister and I are 2 professional women (Chemist/Psychologist) we were surprised to witness this type of treatment from furniture salesmen. But I guess when you walk into this location with the wrong skin color you get no service... 2014MLK Day... Smh"
"NC","Ethan Allen is the type of furniture store where you encounter consultants.  A panel of ""American Idol"" judges (although...nicely dressed ones) will meet you as you walk in.  The eyes will quickly look you up and down to vet your level of purchasing power.  They probably saw the vehicle you rolled up in as well.

While helpful, our sales woman seemed to be helping us in an ""affordable"" way.  She was also missing the point of what we wanted.  Yes, we pulled up in my pickup truck, yes we looked a bit of a mess.  We had just finished working in the yard and decided to head out to look for some new bedroom pieces.  

The whole experience managed to take a 180 degree turn once our sales woman found out that we had a Temperpedic bed.  No kidding?  You mean, you can't always judge a book by its cover?  Who'd a thought?

As far as the furniture is concerned, Ethan Allen has some excellent pieces.  High quality stuff with the abilty to customize just about anything.  Sure you'll pay for it, but we all know that we get what we pay for.

Two things would make a trip to Ethan Allen a five-star experience:

1.  I want more to look at and touch.  The minimal space affords enough room to display each diverse style they carry...but guess what...not that many people are going to buy a denim couch, or insanely ornate, mirrored and metalic pieces. 

2.  This isn't project runway, and I'm not coming here to be evaluated for a home loan.  If I walk in to your store, I can afford your furniture."
"NC","Love this place. We go here every year for Christmas ornaments and decorations. I love the variety of home decor you can find here."
"NC","Having just moved to the area with my resplendent girlfriend, one of my bloodcurdlingly saucy gentleman friends advised we hit Garden Ridge. So we did just that. After hearing of sweet deals and a wide array, of unique and tasteful items I was all about it.

As I drifted aimlessly through what seemed to an ocean of useless baubles, I thought to myself...""Hey me, this place is way overpriced for the quality of the stuff available."" I totally agreed with myself and also admired how sexy my voice was, even when its just in my own head. Just when I thought all was lost...it happened.

One of the most beautiful lamps I have ever laid eyes upon. I'm not even going to tell you what it was, cause I know you will just bite my style in hopes of being super cool like me. First of all, this is no cake walk sister. Do you know what it like to be so cool that the elderly and small children freeze to death when they come within 20 feet of you? No...didn't think so. What ensued was me trying to build the most heinous lamp I possibly could, while trying not to have my girlfriend murder me. I t truly was the highlight of my garden ridge excursion. And despite her coming close to strangling me to death in front of a woman who I suspected was wearing a fright wig, and cut off sweatpant shorts, I prevailed. Ultra bad-ass night table lamp was born.

A lot useless junk, that they are charging way to much for. If you have some cash to throw around and want to get a few things for your house or garden then go right ahead. You may even find a few gems here and there. But don't go in there expecting great bargains or stuff that is going to blow your doors off....aint happening Mojumbo."
"NC","Is it me or have the prices at Garden Ridge gotten ridiculously high? I admit that I'm more of a seasonal Garden Ridge shopper - Christmas season, but thought I'd go have a look around today...really? Small pressed wood end tables for $149 - $400 for an 8x10' rug? As I looked around more, I realized that most, if not all, of what I'd want could be purchased cheaper at Wal-Mart or Target...and better quality. No wonder the store was empty. There was a sign out front saying that they're planning on revamping the store....I hope that means they'll be sharpening their pencils and cutting those prices or the next sign we'll see out front is For Lease!"
"NC","Garden Ridge is not the same...it has really gone downhill.  It seems that they have bought out other stores of items that did not sell...junky items.  Every time I go in there I can never find anyone to help me and they only have one register open. Their shopping carts are all rusty and broken. I miss the old Garden Ridge."
"NC","A bit of a flea market feel, with some great deals to be found.  I don't shop everything here, but I'm partial to the patio umbrellas.  I have two decks that I use for entertaining...and umbrellas can often get in the way.  I love the off-set umbrellas, but they are generally an arm-and-a-leg in price.  Garden Ridge saves the day by selling the umbrellas for $80.  Since I use a minimum of four on my decks, this saves me a huge amount.

*If you're like me, and like using these umbrellas, make sure to attach them very securely and to put the umbrellas down on windy days."
"NC","I bought some Halloween lights there a few weeks ago that did not work for, $3.99.  Went back to exchange them for better quality ones without my receipt, they said they could not refund.  I thought that was petty of them to not take them back.  They still got my sale for the better quality ones.  The clerk said she was sorry.  If the management was actually sorry they would have refunded my $3.99 don't you think?"
"NC","In the past two weeks, I have gone to both Garden Ridge stores.  It is a tremendous difference between the two.  The southern store, is very organized.  I can spend hours upon hours in the different areas looking at merchandise for each room of the house.  From cookware to holiday items to rugs for my foyer.  And my last trip was just amazing.  I had to return to select items that were a better match for my decor.  The sales person....simply glowed and sparkled with the greatest smile. She handled the return and provided great directions to different areas I needed to visit.  Upon checking out.....I was fortunate enough to have the same salesperson...this time glowing even more as she had spent time rearranging trees that were full of glitter to keep the store in order!!!  I will return to the store for the great merchandise and the sparkling service offered by Ms. Glitter!!!"
"NC","I mentioned to a friend that I was headed to one of the big chains (rhymes with Sprawl-Mart) to pick up some furniture for my balcony. He said I should head here instead and what a great suggestion that was. GR is a MASSIVE store with not just outdoor furniture but they also stock tons and tons of really neat stuff for indoors too. 

In the lawn furniture section, I had a selection of prices colors and styles. I managed to narrow down to a neat and comfy pair of chairs with a foot rest and matching side table. All for less than a hundred bucks! What's not to love?

Yep, it's probably only going to last a season or two. But do I really want to pay three times as much for something that will last forever? Sorry, but my budget won't stretch that far."
"NC","This is the ultimate home decor store! And very reasonably priced. 

They have the best selection of christmas ornaments around that If you are like me and you buy ornaments for gifts of teachers and your childrens friends you will be glad! BUT you must shop early in the season like right around Thanksgiving because they will be gone in a hurry.

Need fake potted plants of all sizes, making your own fake arrangement, You are also in luck. They have items for your bathroom, candles galore, artwork and even a HIGH HEEL chair!. 

They have an array of bar stools as well as kitchen chairs, inflatable decor for your yard!. Party supplies, grilling supplies, kitchenware galore. 

having a kids party or doing a elegant affair- you can find everything you need to decorate, keep foods warm, serve with, beverage dispensers. 

They often have entire aisles on clearance so look for the signs!

You can get some clothes here that maybe you want to decorate. Or maybe you need some new throw pillows, or unique foods, or bedspreads, or a new suitcase! 

This store is so amazing. You must go here and look, especially if you have that one person on your list that has everything and you have no clue what to get them-- you will find something here! 

I love this store and wish i could spend hours here"
"NC","I could get lost in this place for days!  Everything under the sun for home, garden, and probably a lot more that I just haven't discovered yet.  They even have clothing? Lol...too funny.  No, I won't be buying clothes here FYI.  Pricing seems to be pretty good too.  I would kill to have a shopping spree and a big enough house to fit ALL THE THINGS! :)

I'll be back for the 6'0"" Knight in Shining Armor one day!"
"NC","Garden Ridge has just turned into a junky flea market.  GAG !!!"
"NC","You could spend hours in Garden Ridge.  I go in there a couple of times a year and there are always new items in stock.  It's a giant warehouse full of...all kinds of ""stuff.""  

This past weekend, we got a bathroom rug and some artificial flowers.  This past summer, we got a great outdoor patio dining set.  They've got everything from holiday merchandise to lamps to to bedding to rugs to furniture to artificial plants/flowers to luggage to kitchenware to art to candles.  If you're looking for Christmas decorating ideas this season, stop by Garden Ridge.  They have a huge supply of outdoor decorations, artificial trees, and row upon row of ornaments and other indoor decor.  

You can almost always find a sale at Garden Ridge, but sometimes you've gotta hunt and peck through their warehouse of merchandise to find just that thing you want/need at the price you want to pay.  It's that giant building behind the Carolina Place mall that looks like a Home Depot at first glance."
"NC","If you are looking for home decor items, you definitely want to check this place out. It is a HUGE warehouse full of everything you could need for your home at awesome prices. It's not set up to look as nice as other decor stores, but if you know what you need and can visualize, you will have no problems here. I found a great floor vase and tons of garden items, plus some odds and ends like key hooks, vases and a really cute step stool so my vertically-challenged self can look out our peephole when someone's at the door. The employees that I dealt with weren't so helpful, but the awesome products and great deals make up for it."
"NC","Very dated, small bathroom, tube TV

Breakfast was good."
"NC","Convenient to Carowinds theme park, and excellent hot breakfast.

We stayed here for a cheap hotel for the whole family & were very happy with the experience. The free breakfast was delicious (biscuits & gravy, sausage, bacon, eggs, waffles, yogurt, milk, juice, cereal, pastries, muffins, bagels, oatmeal). The pool was nice too, and they have extra towels by the pool so you don'th ave to use the room towels.

Not a super fancy hotel, but it was a good value and convenient location, lots of restaurants nearby."
"NC","4.5 stars!

Judging from the older reviews I'm reading, this place must've undergone a serious makeover before we stayed here! 

We had a phenomenal stay! Booked this hotel as a Hotwire Hot Rate (where they don't tell you the name of the hotel until you book it). I was a little dismayed when I found out what hotel we got because I had never heard of this place... in fact, I thought we were going to be staying at a Comfort Inn. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised! This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in (and I travel quite a bit). Convenient location, beautiful and spacious property, friendly staff... I would definitely stay here again!

Pros:
-Clean, modern and bright décor. Welcoming feel from the moment you arrive
-Friendly staff
-Beds are firm and comfortable
-Lots of surfaces to place your luggage
-Maids are thorough with their cleaning!
-Plenty of outlets on each night stand and the on desk (which also has two USB ports) 
-Free WiFi
-In the same shopping center as the Skyzone Trampoline park
-A quick 15 minute (or less) ride from downtown Charlotte
-Bathroom has ample light and counter space
-Very strong water pressure and temperature: hot is very hot and cold is very cold!
-Plenty of washcloths and towels
-Sink, fridge, microwave and sofabed in room
-Free full breakfast daily: Belgian waffles, scrambled eggs, biscuits, sausage, danishes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, milk, OJ, apple juice, coffee...
-Lots of stores and restaurants within walking distance
-There is an outdoor pool (it's available for use during the summer months, but they keep it full and running all year round. Very strange that they don't drain it) 

Cons:
-Bathroom is cramped
-Can hear muffled conversation of guests next door to you as well and random thumping and knocking (the people next to us had young kids and let them run amok all effing night). If you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs
-Doors have very loose hinges and slam loudly
-Pillows were too soft for my taste
-Maid came knocking around 8:30 a.m. asking if we wanted room service (way too early!)
-TV had lots of channels, but no identifier to let you know what channel you're watching
-The pipes are LOUD ; you can hear each time someone in a nearby room uses water (toilet, sink, shower)
-No utensils or dishes in the room (but there are plenty of plastic ones downstairs in the lobby!)"
"NC","For what you pay here, this hotel is just fine. Sure there's some things that aren't as nice as you might find in other hotels, but this is a Comfort Suites, not a Hilton. 

The lobby area is set up nicely with a living room ambiance and the breakfast area behind it. I had a king room on the fifth floor which was better than I was expecting. Everything was clean, the furniture was in good repair, and there was a little kitchenette with a small sink, microwave, and fridge. I think the only issue I had with my room was the phone. The cable on the handset seemed to be worn out and there was some static when making a call.

The biggest issue I had was with two different front desk staff. The first was a gentleman that gave me completely wrong directions on how to get to the light rail station by bus. Had I taken his directions blindly I would have ended up somewhere in South Carolina. The second issue was when I asked for a late check-out. The staff member said that I could have an extra hour and check-out at noon instead of 11. Just after 11 on the day of check-out, housekeeping came knocking at the door. They weren't told that I had asked for a late check-out and she asked if she could come back at 2:00. It sounded like 2:00 was a normal time for a late check-out. So is it up to the staff at the front desk to pull a time out of the air or does the hotel actually have a late check-out policy?"
"NC","They've got boys' clothes.  They've got girls' clothes."
"NC","Went to buy boots for the girls. Pretty uneventful. Looks like the cast from any Disney show stocked the entire place. Staff was nice and helpful. The girls jumped up and down at every glittery thing they saw. Oh, and ""can I get this, daddy?"" was the question of the day followed by the official response of the day, ""HELL NO!"" by me.

Oh wait, you mean this is the same exact review for http://www.yelp.com/biz/p-s-from-aeropostale-pineville#hrid:8cycFTIbYWZ9X9z841mq_g/src:self"
"NC","Never had a problem with this location; I'm not usually in there very long except to get some tennis balls and make some socks.  In and out in 15 minutes or less, if that.  The staff seem engaged; I don't really have any complaints.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because nothing wowed me, but I'll be back I'm sure."
"NC","Thank you everyone who posted reviews. Due to the information I have now researched, I will not be attending this store ever. I will be driving to another dicks location bc clearly this one seems to be one hot mess."
"NC","I've been to several Dick's sporting good stores and this one is by far one of the worst. 

A few years ago I took my mountain bike to them for a basic service. Upon picking it up I realized that my high end pedals had been switched with some of the ones they use on their floor. I brought this up to the staff's attention who didn't hesitate in saying that I was wrong and they don't do that. I asked to speak to the manager an nobody was there from the management staff. I asked them to go review their security footage and they said they didn't want to do that either. I took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologized.

I since stopped frequenting them. Sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areaI had to visit this location again recently, I had a backpack on as I rode there in my motorcycle. I walked in the store and started headed to the department I was needing, I was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me I could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues. I told her that I had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule. I also informed her that there was no signage stating that as I walked in the store. She continued to state that I could either give them my backpack or I could leave the store!!!!

I told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as I did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in it.

This brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant. They are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels it's pathetic.

I wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area."
"NC","I now understand where the name comes from. Yesterday I went into Dick's to buy my daughter some shirts. As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. 
I started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like "" missing manual or dead battery"" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. 
I was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. 
I asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. 
I get ""as is"" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.
Now I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price. 
Thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch.

"NC","Oh Dick's!  Bet you never started a review like that before.

You never cease to underwhelm me with your mediocrity.  We sort of have good stuff, we sort of have OK prices.  We sort of want customers to be loyal.  What gives?

I used to frequent Dicks all the time.  Mainly due to lack of better options.  I realize that this is retail...and many of your workers are here for a paycheck...but for the love of God...a sporting goods store should have people that know something about sporting goods.

Just because somebody works in the shoe department does not make them a shoe expert.  I've never heard such ridiculous shoe ""expertise"" as I did last time I visited.

PS.  Not all bats are legal in all softball leagues.  FYI"
"NC","Not the best shopping for firearms accessories, but I managed to find something that fit my needs. Dick's (you do need to spell out the entire dickssportinggoods.com because just the first name and dot com gets you a completely different type of indoor sports) has a great selection of things that you wear when you plan on engaging in sporting and camping activities - shoes, gloves, shorts, shirts, hats - and anything that you might use to hit a ball  - bat, stick, club. Plus things to use when you're out in the woods. If the zombie apocalypse happens and the world ends, this would be a good first stop.

Wide aisles and good choices. Checkout is as organized and quick as it can be. No complaints."
"NC","It is a good alternative to BassPro and a much shorter drive for me. The selections are a bit limited but for the most part I can find what I need. Since they have renovated the store their hunting supplies have increased a little but would like to see a bit more."
"NC","This Dick's in Pineville has your typical sporting goods found at other locations.  Seems like there is a better selection of running shoes at this store than the others I have been to in the area.

Also, even though the building seems fairly large, the clothing and shelves are really packed in - I got a little claustrophobic walking through and browsing the men's section."
"NC","I consider Dicks to be by far the best sporting good store in Charlotte or the surrounding areas. It has pretty much everything from basketball equipment to under armor clothing. They also carry things like exercise equipment, guns, heart monitors, weight lifting gear, etc, etc.

They even have a climbing wall (at least the one at South Park mall does)."
"NC","Not our first visit and not our last. Great quality German food and beers. Spatzle red cabbage and schnitzels galore. I like the wurst platte and the wife loves Jagerschnitzel. Portions are not quite big enough to split unless you load up on soups and the fabulous pretzel bread."
"NC","Unreal German food in a decent environment with excellent service!
I also love the plethora of German beer. It is sooooo good! I had the Rindsrouladen...
Braised Beef Rouladen stuffed with bacon, onions and pickle. It was delicous in every way.The side items were Spätzle and red cabbage... also excellent.
A pleasant surprise was the house salad. Ridiculously good. Fresh mixed greens. Perfect amount of dressing. and underneath in four little piles were surprises of carrot, pasta, cabbage, and another Item I have forgotten. All delicious little piles. Like gifts!
Oh, and I almost forgot the BREAD! Good God! The pretzel rolls with a little butter are otherworldly. I want to come back here so bad ... but living in KC it is going to be a while."
"NC","Best authentic German restaurant around! I go there for lunch and dinner. They always have good specials that normally aren't on the menu. Be sure to join their Beer Club, and definitely check out the annual Oktoberfest."
"NC","I would go back again.  Went with my roommate, we were seated for lunch time on a Saturday afternoon quickly.  Nearby the Red Hat Women's Society were gathering for lunch and we had the chance to see some really nice hats!  The menu is in both German & English and if you have any questions, your server will explain the ingredients or how it's made.  Our server was Val, who was very informative and friendly.  I'm glad I asked what made German potato salad different than American potato salad because it's served cold and made with beef broth.. I'm a vegetarian, so if i'd have ordered it, I would have either not been able to enjoy it or send it back to the kitchen.  Always best making informed decisions.  My roommate also had question about what was in the pasta pillows, which is a mixture of pork, beef, turkey and spinach.. and since she doesn't eat pork, it's very good she asked and didn't order blindly.  For appetizers she ordered the potato pancakes with applesauce, and I ordered the pumpkin soup... both were delicious!  I've had the potato pancakes before and they were exactly as I remembered, crispy on the outside and tenderly cooked potato pieces on the inside and with the combination of the cool applesauce.. very good.  The pumpkin soup was delicious!  I mean absolutely heavenly.. it was like I was eating a thick warm soupy pumpkin pie complete with a dabble of cream.  Nice pieces of pumpkin throughout.  Pumpkin soup is a fall treat and favorite!

On to the entrees: I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich which was also very tasty and filling.  The sandwich is served on rye and is filled with of course portobello mushroom, munster cheese, spinach, and a very delightful tomato aioli pesto spread, and a pickle on the side.  The sandwich comes with a side.  The choices are German potato salad, mixed greens, mixed vegetables or french fries.  I opted for the decent sized salad of mixed greens, carrots, cabbage and balsamic vinaigrette.  My roommate got the fried flounder with a large salad (German potato salad, mixed greens, carrot salad, etc. all mixed together).  She seemed to enjoy it.

Didn't have time for dessert as I had to dash to work, but overall it was a good experience.  The restaurant is very beautiful on the outside, clean and organized on the inside, family-oriented, staff is helpful and attentive, prices are reasonable.  They even offer classes to learn German which I thought was pretty neat, and there is live music on both Friday and Saturday evenings.  The restaurant is fairly active in the community by participating in and holding community events, such as Oktoberfest and holiday gatherings throughout the year."
"NC","I really enjoyed this different take on food! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the buffet is only available on Sundays and it was awesome! It can't ever be as good only having one item from the menu! GREAT food!!!!!!"
"NC","Absolutely amazing meal every time. The best beer, food, and ambiance. A must do in Charlotte!!! Yummy"
"NC","Great food, but still miss the German restaurant in hickory. We will be back for sure. Very nice place. Loved the carpaccio, a must have,"
"NC","Olde German Schnitzel Haus, our local award winning Germany restaurant, closed at the end of August. 

I found no less than three German restaurants, while searching on Yelp, and oddly enough they were all exactly one hour from Hickory: 
(1) ""Berliner Kindl German Restaurant"" in Black Mountain. (Bookmarked)
(2) ""The German Restaurant"" in Yadkinville. (Fantastic!)
(3) ""Waldhorn Restaurant"" in Pineville. (Bookmarked)

I have had Waldhorn on my ""to try list"" seemingly forever, so I headed toward Pineville for lunch.

I had every intention of ordering German sausages, sauerkraut, fried potatoes, and German beer, but they had a dish on the lunch menu that sounded appetizing. It was a veal dish with sauteed mushrooms in a brown gravy atop Spätzle, accompanied by sautéed vegetables. This dish sounded good to me so I changed my mind at the last minute. It was delicious, but it was a very plain Jane looking dish, so I didn't take any photos. 

I was seated immediately, but it took a good ten minutes for the young male bartender to stop talking golf and NASCAR before he pulled my Spaten lager. When he did get around to his duties, he did a very good job. 

Note: Spaten brewery was started in the year 1397, and it is delicious beer! It is also deceptively potent. 

I also drank a Spaten Oktoberfest beer, and that was fantastic as well!

I enjoyed Waldhorn, and it was well worth the hour's drive. 

When I return I will try an assortment of German sausages with mustard, sauerkraut, fried potatoes, and a German beer or two. 

Waldhorn Restaurant is highly recommended!"
"NC","What a great restaurant with authentic German food! We arrived Sunday night at 7:30 and the parking lot was pretty full, a good sign. Overall the food was fantastic, flavorful, delicious and served just right. We enjoyed the pretzel rolls with our entrees of schnitzel and rouladen, just authentic German food. The inside decor was fitting, not overdone but comfortable and spot on. The service was attentive and friendly. As out of town visitors we were very pleased to find the Waldhorn, and plan to visit again."
"NC","First visit.  I love this place.  The atmosphere is great, feels authentic, and is fun.  I had a sausage sampler that was very good.  My wife had crab cakes, the best she ever had, according to her.  My daughter had grilled salmon that was good, cooked just right, and tasty.  The menu is great with authentic German fair as well as standard American dishes.  The beer of course flows like water over Niagara Falls, and just as cold.  You really should visit this restaurant at least once, preferably in the month of October."
"NC","The young lady at the front desk was very professional to all customers even though some customers were not.  Incident taken on this date at 18:32 hours."
"NC","Sunday brunch is a must if you're coming to the Waldhorn. Overall the food is very good and the staff is friendly, but some dishes are better than others. The sausages are amazing, as they should be at any German restaurant. The spaetzle is also great, and the potato salad is the best I've ever had. Some of their meat options are just average though, and I didn't care for the sauerbraten when I've tried it. They have an excellent array of breads and desserts too, which overall are all good to great."
"NC","Came here the other day and had THE. BEST. SERVICE. EVER. Everything was spot on- drinks, apps, entrees, you name it. Even swamped with the Oktoberfest, I was blown away. Tipped 30%. Food was fantastic as usual. Try this place out!"
"NC","Really good stuff!!! Service was incredible - pretzel rolls were to-die-for. I think between 3 of us, we had 3 baskets.... Sausages are delectable and spaetzle and red cabbage is awesome. We are to be new regulars!!!"
"NC","I compare all German foods and restaurants in one way ... ""Is it as good as Mama Schuele's home cooking?""
The answer is never ""Yes"", but the Waldhorn is as close as I have ever come to that.

We come for the Sunday Brunch,  which offers a great selection of breakfast foods along with many German favorites. 

I'm currently enjoying that along with a litre of my favorite Hefeweizen. Good times."
"NC","Dined here June 2014.  I had a saugage/brautwurst combination plate, which was excellent.  The decor is nothing to write home about.  The service was good."
"NC","If you're looking for EVERYTHING German this is the spot. From decor and food to drinks and the staff's language skills and knowledge. It's a pretty awesome transition in atmosphere as soon as you walk in the door. The food is delicious as well - couldn't pronounce much of it, but tasted great!

Best tip about this place: The staff's knowledge and understanding of all German heritage. I asked about a million questions about the menu and traditions and this server was spot on!"
"NC","NOT repeat Not for celiacs! The kitchen ignores whatever the server tells them. When the meal comes out wrong, everyone else is done before the plate comes back out. The manager apologizes, but it they don't take it seriously, this happened both times we've been here, but we won't be back. I like the food, but I don't like dining alone."
"NC","We were in Charlotte visiting Carowinds and we were tired when we checked into our hotel. Plan A was to find a mid-level chain and bring take-out back to our room, but then I spotted Waldhorn's on the list. The ratings and reviews looked way too good to be true, but I have a soft spot for German food and the prices looked downright reasonable. So we rallied and had one of the best dining experiences of our lives.

The service was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Great recommendations on beer and appetizer.

With a Warsteiner Dunkel for him and a Spaten Oktoberfest for me, we started with a Gebackener Ziegenkäse. The pastry was light and perfectly crisped. The goat cheese, spinach & sun-dried tomato filling was surprisingly light, even after dredging it through the brown gravy and sour cream.

For our entree, my other half ordered the Hausgemachte Maultaschen ""geschmelzt"", pasta filled with meat and spinach, lightly dressed with sauteed onions and beef broth. I ordered Wienerschnitzel, but I wasn't enthused about french fries and the veg of the day (broccoli) being served with it, so the server cheerfully and enthusiastically switched them for spaetzle and red cabbage. 

Our meals were perfect. Every single mouthful was perfect. The spaetzle was really light and was sincerely the best I've ever had. The red cabbage was beautifully prepared. The wienerschnitzel melted in my mouth. His meal was a little lighter than mine, but still filling and so very delicious.

And reasonable! Two beers, appetizer, and two entrees? $50 before the tip. 

Now I'm mad because it's so far away."
"NC","Although I use Yelp constantly, I've never been compelled to contribute my own review. After such a great experience at Waldhorn, I'm ready. I'm no expert on German food, but my husband and I have been to Germany and Austria and absolutely loved the food. I surprised him with a birthday meal at Waldhorn and it not only lived up to, but exceeded our hopes. The food was excellent and we had great service- we'll definitely be returning."
"NC","We have lived in Charlotte for almost 4 years and always wanted to go to this place, but were put off because they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. Last night, the two of us decided to walk in early (about 6:00 P.M. on a Friday night, our date night) and were immediately seated. We were put in a back room containing two large, long tables and a few tables for four. One of the large tables was already filled with about 20 people, and the noise was deafening. That entire room apparently has nothing on the walls or ceiling to absorb noise. We noticed that, at one of the tables for four, people were getting up and leaving without ordering. Even worse, the place has a lot of young children who were constantly running around and getting in the way of the waitstaff which, by the way, was excellent.

We started with two Ketel One on the rocks. When ordering a second round, we were told they had run out of Ketel One--at 6:15 on a Friday night. We then split a Waldhorn salad, which was good. We both had the sauerbraten with spaeztle and red cabbage. The meat was dry and the spaetzle didn't even look or taste like spaetzle. From our experience, spaetzle are dumplings pressed through a sieve.. This stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles. Since I love Black Forest cake, I took a piece home. It was tasteless, and the fruit center was nothing more than filler. This was represented to us as ""home made.""

The owners of this place are represented as having been culinary-institute trained. We can't believe it. We have eaten at restaurants owned and operated by culinary-institute graduates and the food tasted nothing like this. We cannot, therefore, understand the rave reviews. We also cannot understand how culinary-institute graduates (if this is actually so) could serve this stuff. To each his own, I guess."
"NC","My family went here for Easter lunch- party of 15 & we had the whole upstairs basically to ourselves. The waiter was fantastic!! Officiant, courteous, professional & friendly. It was a buffet & everything was hot, fresh & delicious. They worked hard at keeping all the choices full. The only thing that didn't sit well was their rating of a 91. That's pretty low. We had a great time though & this will always be a family favorite restaurant."
"NC","You don't see German restaurants very often and I'm glad I ran into this one for lunch. To begin, great atmosphere and stellar service. And because it's a German spot, I had to order the Wiener Schnitzel. I'm glad I did because it was fantastic. It's been a while since I've had breaded veal, but to say I was satisfied would be an understatement."
"NC","Everytime I'm in the area I stop here.  Great selection of German Beers.  Staff could not be more welcoming and friendly.  Schnitzel, red cabbage, potato pancakes are excellent.  If you are not filled by the end of the meal the black forest cake is a can't miss."
"NC","Now I really try to like this place , especially since my fiancé lived in Germany for a few years and when I took him here with friends for his birthday he proposed to me . So of course it is special to me for other reasons. However this site is to help review the food and to be honest I just think it's bland and incredibly boring.. The only items I care for are the red cabbage and the dumplings other than that I have tried several different things because my fiancé gets in the mood for German food and this is the only place in Charlotte we know of .. Other than for sentimental reasons though I personally would not chose to eat here."
"NC","An all around great restaurant!  The service is friendly and fast and the food does not disappoint.  The sausage plate and goat cheese appetizers are both fantastic as well as the complimentary pretzel rolls.  They have plenty of traditional German fare such as Weinerschnitzel, sauerkraut, spaetzle, etc. and it is all delicious!  Beware: the portions are HUGE.  Luckily, they offer a ""Lite Appetite"" menu as well. If you save room for dessert, the apple strudel is a must. It's great to have this restaurant in Charlotte, it's very unique and stands out."
"NC","Absolutely fantastic authentic German cuisine. Went for the first time for restaurant week and the portions were beyond huge. Great entertainment as well on Saturday nights by buffalo bill the  accordion player. Can't wait to go back for Sunday brunch."
"NC","This was our first  experience at the Waldhorn and, I must say, we were impressed. Our experience started with beers (of course) before dinner while we waited for our table. The bar staff was pleasant, welcoming, and quite efficient. The bar had 11 German beers on tap, ranging from Pilsner to Optimator, and several more in bottles. 

Despite the fact that it was restaurant week in Charlotte and the Waldhorn had an impressive Queen's Feast (4 courses), we decided to order from the regular menu. We started with the sausage sampler. Each sausage was delicious and presented beautifully with a dollop of sour kraut and a bit of mustard. 

For our main courses, I had the rouladen and my wife had the sauerbraten.  Simply put, it was the best rouladen I have had in a restaurant. Tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. Karen's sauerbraten was fork-tender and served in a light, but delicious, sauce. 

We finished with the apple strudel and ice cream. Flakey and warm. A perfect way to end the evening. 

The only real negative to our experience was the roaming accordion player. Don't get me wrong, he was a fine musician. However, the music was almost unbearably loud in such confined spaces. Conversation became a controlled shouting match while he was around. 
Overall, you should go there.  Just don't eat for a day or two prior to your visit."
"NC","Because every town needs a good German restaurant, just wish it wasn't so out of the way. Beer club member here and there is also a meetup group that holds an awesome board game night here on a regular basis."
"NC","Fabulous place!!!   Went during Queens Feast Restaurant week and it was very organized and accommodating . Food and staff could not be better! Definitely will come back!"
"NC","Went with a large group. Fast service, great service! The pretzel rolls are delish! I ordered the house side salad and the lighter appetite marinated beef slices. It was a delicious, German meal. Would highly recommend if UR a German or if you love German dishes"
"NC","Best German food in town. A good traditional beer selection along with traditional favorites such as wurst and schnitzel. Their Oktoberfest tent is a blast and worth a visit. If you can't make it across the pond then the Waldhorn  is a trip worth making."
"NC","First time here this past Friday for lunch. Hadn't had a Wiener schnitzel since Vienna. I really enjoyed Waldhorn 's version. I will be back."
"NC","I had Munich Spaten Oktoberfest beer with carpaccio beef and salad vinaigrette for an appetizer. Venison rouladen with hunter sauce, red cabbage, spatzle, poached pear and lingon berry sauce for dinner.   I had no room for dessert, although I'm sure it would have been great if I did.   The accordian player was great, and came over to play us ""Que Sera Sera"" and we all sang along!  A great time was had by all."
"NC","Wonderful German fare.  A great destination for dinner. We called ahead and waited 15 min.  Not bad considering it's popularity. They have a wide selection of German food. The spaetzele is the best side dish to order."
"NC","I took an out-of-town guest here for dinner.  Our hopes were up as we walked up to the building and then entered.

The restaurant was busy with two private parties; however, we were seated upon arrival, and there was still plenty of seating available.

First off, the beer menu.  They have a fairly decent selection of drafts and bottles--think an extended list of your usual German suspects (Spaten, Franziskaner, Warsteiner, etc.).  Ultimately, I wasn't very impressed.

The bill of fare had a decent amount of variety, and the descriptions made narrowing a selection difficult.  Fortunately, the sampler special of the evening provided a convenient choice!

I started with the bowl of Hungarian Goulash.  The portion was quite large.  However, I found the broth somewhat too salty, and the meat chunks were dry and tough.

Like the soup, I found my entree to be a little too salty, which was disappointing, because the spaetzle and red cabbage were otherwise quite nice.  I found the meats to be somewhat dry and tough, similar to that of the goulash.  All of this was too bad, because the portions were easily large enough for two meals.

Finally, I'm guessing ""dry"" must be a theme at this place, because even the black forest cake was also a little dry.

For the record:  I didn't complain nor send any of the food back out of respect for my guest.  I just didn't want to create a scene in front of my guest.

Waitstaff were prompt enough, but our server kept forgetting drink orders and generally just seemed nonchalant about providing good service.


So, minus one star for the ditzy waitress.  Minus 1.5 stars for the food.  I rounded down, because I disagree with the more positive reviews.  I was expecting something stellar, and I feel rather let down.

I will come back and give them one more chance, but only one more chance."
"NC","If you are in the Charlotte area and are looking for authentic German cuisine, then this is the place for you.

Having spent some time in Germany and having a German wife, I am very familiar with this type of food.

The service was great, the food was fresh and as close to Deutsch as possible. We had the American favorite...schnitzel. I also had the side salad and it was delicious. It was served with a small scoop of German potato salad, which is how you get it at the guesthouse in Germany. I topped off the meal with a very delicious serving of Apple strudel. 

My only issue was the red cabbage. It was not what I am used to and was a bit too sweet.

Overall this is a great place and I will be back next time I am in town."
"NC","Amazing and authentic German food! We just got back from a trip to Germany (Nuremberg and Munich) and the food took me right back to our trip. 

We have been here numerous times for food and beer. They have an excellent selection of Belgium beers....some of these I actually drank in Germany.

Came here for lunch today with my husband. We both ordered the bratwurst sandwich. It was a bratwurst split in half, covered with craut, and on a soft pretzel bun. So many flavors and soooooo good! Definitely recommend it! 

Overall, excellent spot with great authentic beer and food. 

PS- A few month ago when we went here, we ended up chatting with our server for a long time. She was from Germany and was extremely knowlegable about German food and culture. It was so interesting talking with someone who just recently moved to the US from Germany."
"NC","My wife and I had our wedding reception here last month and we can't sing their praises enough!  They made it so easy for us so we could focus our attention on everything from actually getting married to coordinating out of town guests joining us.  The staff was helpful, good-natured, seem to be enjoying themselves as much as our guests (our reception was a little unconventional).  Oh, and did I mention the food?  The sausage combination was juicy and delicious, the veggies were crisp and delicious, the pork loin was so tender and the sauce was creamy and tangy, the salad options were all that you could expect from a fine German restaurant (make some extra room for the red cabbage especially), and of course the delicious spatzle made the meal just all we could've hoped for.  If you haven't been here yet, might I suggest checking out the Sunday brunch buffet first to get a good feel for what they have to offer.  This place will hold a special place in our hearts for taking so much stress out of our big day.  :-)"
"NC","We had a dinner reservation for 19 people on one of the busiest weekends of the year. The food, service and staff were excellent."
"NC","One of the best German restaurants in the country.  Great beer selection. Everything I've tried is excellent. Service is excellent. This is my favorite restaurant of all time. You won't be disappointed."
"NC","I am a beer club member and every time I come to Charlotte for work I make sure to show up at least once during the week.  I never had German food in Germany, but I have gone with some co-workers that have and they say that this place is as authentic as it gets."
"NC","The service was great and the food was even better! I had Jagerschnitzel with s tell cold German lager. Great place and I will be back!"
"NC","Wunderbar! Authentic! Eleven German draft beers. The server( Stefanie) was from Dresden and did a great job. Sauerbraten, spatzle, and rot kohl were great!"
"NC","You will feel transported to Germany (well, close enough) when you come up the drive for the quaint, authentic building.  5 yelp stars for the beer and the beer list.  The pretzel rolls that came gratis were excellent, and would have been worth an app price if served with a good beer cheese.  The  weiner schnitzel was average good.  It came on a jaeger (brown, mushroom) sauce, which is not traditional at all.  The rouladen was pretty good.  For those not in the know - rouladen is like a rolled up burger with bacon and pickles.  Pretty good!  

But - Where are the dirndls and lederhosen on the wait staff??  And no German music, no background music at all.  A small touch of ambiance, but authentic music would go a long way.  Our server was from Honduras, and wasn't familiar with German food, but he was honest about the sauerbraten being dry (true) and he was jovial and sincere.  Excellent option for German in Charlotte!  Hoping to come back for Oktoberfest in our dirndl and lederhosen!  Prost!!"
"NC","You know a place is good when the servers are enthusiastic about the food themselves. Great dinner with dessert of Apfelstrudel - fantastic. Service solid and efficient, smiles all round. Should have been busier though, they deserve to be"
"NC","Out of all the things to have at a great German restaurant, I had the trout and it was great! Cute place! A local friend recommended it and I was not disappointed."
"NC","One of our favorite restaurants!  Been there many times for Sunday brunch, beer club Tuesdays and special occasions.  Most recently we stopped by for the Charlotte restaurant week special.  This is a really good deal as they have many more selections than any other restaurant and offer 4 courses instead of 3.  Everything is great but I highly recommend trying the Ungarische Gulaschsuppe, like the best beef stew ever.  The brunch is also something everyone should experience.  The omelets are amazing and the beef tenderloin carving station just takes it over the top.  There is a huge selection of items with lots of German items to choose from."
"NC","Yay!  Good German food in Charlotte!  Traveling accordion player.  Attentive service.  Jagerschnitzel.  Pretzel rolls.  Need I say more?"
"NC","How could you not love this place?

I've been going to the Waldhorn for the last ten years or so for birthdays, special events, and especially when my grandparents come to town (My grandparents LOVE German food)!

The food is awesome! First they bring out all the varieties of bread, all are amazing but of course my family often has to fight over who gets the last piece of pretzel bread! Looking at the entrees, they have a great selection of classic German food. I have had most of the dinner entree's but most recently I had the Sauerbraten, which was great.  I haven't had anything I did not like!   I also really love their spatzle and red cabbage.  If the entree I choose doesn't comes with something different, I always substitute for those two sides.

The German beer selection has changed throughout the years but I am always satisfied with whatever German beers they have on tap.  Good stuff!

Unfortunately I have never had their desserts.  I always stuff myself with the bread and the dinner entree that I cannot physically eat anymore.

Great place, check it out if you haven't already!"
"NC","Jenna took great care of us! Food and service was top notch! 10/10 Jenna, congrats on the new job!"
"NC","It was the best meal I have had in weeks. Friendly staff, incredible desserts and very quiet witch I liked."
"NC","Very good. Would never have found it, if it was not for my father. It looks like an old german castle"
"NC","Excellent service and the most delicious food! The waitstaff is very attentive and friendly and the manager Brian is awesome. My husband compares the kartoffelpuffer to the potato pancakes that his mom or grandmother would make - very authentic. They have a great selection of German beers and wines. The sauerbraten and gegrillter lachs are two of my favorite entrees. I also highly recommend the rindsrouladen and the schnitzel. The portion sizes are very generous; I always had leftovers to take home. The apfelstrudel is a must for dessert. While living in the Charlotte area, we ate here at least once every week or two. Hands down best and most authentic German restaurant I have ever eaten at."
"NC","I found this place on yelp and made the family take a day trek to Charlotte just so I could try the Sunday brunch everyone was raving about. It was definitely worth it! All sorts of German foods and dessert, bread, and regular breakfast items for the non adventurous eaters. Service was great, the employees were friendly, and the place was nicely decorated and very clean. I wish we had something like it here in Greensboro, but Old Europe in Winston Salem never disappoints for dinner."
"NC","If you plan on coming here for the Sunday Brunch on a holiday, you WILL need a reservation.  I tried to make a reservation and was shut out.  The lady on the phone recommended that I make one two weeks ahead of time.  I hear their brunch is the best in town but I have yet to try it.  

The vibe is pretty relaxed.  You could dress up if you want to but not required at all.  

My review is based on the lunch and dinner service.  Lunch is very good.  The plates run about $10 and the menu is limited of course.

The food is traditional German cuisine.  Pork Chops, Veal, Beef, Red Cabbage (Rotkraut), and Spätzle(German Noodle).  I do not know of any other German restaurant in town so the competition is not there.  But I will say they do a great job compared to a couple German restaurants I have been to in other cities.  There is a dish that has a pickle in the middle of some meat.  I have never had anything like it.  It was delicious even though I was only trying a friends plate.  I wish I had gotten that one.  

For desert, I got a shot of Pear Schnapps.  There was no price on the menu and it ended up being $7.95.  I thought it was a little much but it was good and I will probably get it again so I stay in-line with German traditions.  The Schnapps they have there seems authentic.  It is not sweet at all, it's more of a flavored moonshine.  The waiter said raspberry and pear were the most popular flavors.

My fiancée got the Apfelstrudel (Apple Strudel).  WOW that was amazing!!  Do yourself a favor and save room for desert.  I am looking forward to trying some of the other deserts.   

There are about 8-10 German beers on tap and a little better selection in the bottle.  You can order up to a liter but I think it is the same price as a  1/2 liter.  Next time I will go for the half to have some diversity.  There is a beer club I may join, not for the beer but for the Thursday buffet that only members get to go to.  And it's only about $6.  Sounds like a great deal to me!"
"NC","Excellent beer and food"
"NC","Best dinner of our trip.  Great german food.  The pretzel rolls were amazing, as was the service.  One of the few places I have seen venison on the menu.  We had to try it and weren't disappointed.  Our group also had the stuffed pork (breaded pork tenderloin, stuffed with ham and cheese) and a sampler platter.  The stuffed pork and the (sweet) red cabbage were the highlights of the meal."
"NC","ALWAYS delicious! Oktoberfest is insane every year."
"NC","They serve spaten Oktoberfest year round! Great brots, potato pancakes, and pretzel bread!"
"NC","This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area.  Pretzel rolls are served with a spicy mustard on the side that is to die for.  Food and service is always on point.  They have my Husbands favorite draft beer all year round- Oktoberfest."
"NC","Yep...an honest to goodness authentic German restaurant/gasthaus right here south of Charlotte.  Interior is authentic, with open wood beams, banners and other decorations and a authentic menu to boot.

Having been stationed in Germany with the Army and later in and out for business, I know that I know and this is the real thing.

About a dozen German beers on draft (!) and a lot more bottled.  They even have a beer club.  The beer is served in crisply clean logo-ed mugs along with the traditional beer ""decken"" or cardboard coasters.

Menus for lunch and dinner with cover the waterfront.  Authentic goulash soup and a delirious cream of mushroom soup.  Their German noodles, ""spaetzel"" are perfect, red cabbage also.  Salad greens with that light vinegar and oil dressing was superb.

Wiener-schnitzel was just OK to me...but it was really pork and was not tough.

Great atmosphere and food, hands down.  We will return and look forward to their annual Oktoberfest, which others say is a great, authentic occasion."
"NC","Best German food and beer this side of Germany! Pilsners, pretzel rolls and schnitzel, oh my! Plan to have a couple beers at the bar before dinner. They have several German beers on tap. The food is delicious, we usually end up getting the schnitzel (breaded pork cutlet, stuffed with black forest ham and swiss cheese),  and the duck, of course with spaetzle or bread dumplings. Prepare to embarrass yourself when your party of two inevitably asks for another basket of pretzel rolls, they're that good. This is the epitome of comfort food and will absolutely wreck your diet, but I can at least promise you it will be worth it. The staff are great, you feel like you're dining in someone's very large German home. It's a special night out kind of place, with entrees $15-20. I have no complaints about this place except its not closer to my house."
"NC","Ate here for dinner with my mom; this was our fourth time here, to which my Mom thoroughly enjoys when visiting me while I'm okay about.  

In the most recent visit I ordered for appetizer the Goulash Soup, which I found it to be much creamer than expected.  The soup though was very good overall, with chunks of meat and potatoes floating in the mix.  Mom ordered a salad, she enjoyed it.  The rolls were also very good.

For the main course, I ordered the Wienerschnitzel, which was okay though a bit tough.  Mom ordered the  Rouladen, which she enjoyed greatly.  Overall, my Mom enjoyed the meal and evening, more than me, which is good.  Personally, I prefer the Sunday brunch more because its a buffet that I can pick what I want.  Overall, I give it four out of five."
"NC","Absolutely five stars! Every time I come out this way to see family I make an attempt to stop in. The wait staff is always top notch, the bier is fantastic, the environment is friendly and pleasant; the food is spectacular. Thanks for a wonderful evening!"
"NC","Great food a staff that knows the food and menu. The Beer club is the best thign going in the area after a tueday at work. Close your eyes and open them quick and your in Germany. Beer selections for the real beer drinkers, go in and get a liter of some good germany brews."
"NC","If you are in the mood for German food, look no futher. This place is completely fresh! Not just because it is basically the only German restaurant in the area, but because it is also very, VERY good. 

First off, events. I really need to address this first. Their annual Oktoberfest is a must-attend! I myself had been so fortunate to attend my first year and was completely awed. We first had eaten indoors and went outside to the festival afterwards into the night. The entertainment was of real German-style lights, music, costumes, etc. Beer out in ""the tent"" was modestly priced, and good times were had by all in our party as we took it all in. Very jam-packed, but somehow not necessarily crowded. Parking could be better. If you have the opportunity to go, do so. 

The normal restaurant operation is a good amount less hectic. The atmosphere is somewhat upscale, with a lot of German decor. The food is of very high quality, and as such you pay a little more for it. The beer selection is also very good. 

Haven't had German food often? Want to plan out your next food choice ahead of time? See http://www.waldhorn.us/ and check out their full menu.

Overall, hands down the place to be for German food. Great for dates as well as meals with friends and parties."
"NC","Yep, Five Stars.  If you can show me better German food in our radius, please share!

We have been visiting Waldhorn for quite some time and recently attended the Oktoberfest.  I have to say, the food cannot be judged in a festival environment as strictly because it's being prepared in large bulk.  We tend to come during the week and it does prove to be a difference.  

The sausage plate, spaetzel, red cabbage, pretzel rolls, are just a sample of the great things they have to offer.  The fare is true and the beer is cold.  It's a great break from the norm and for me, the ultimate comfort food.  European cuisine is so warm and hearty.  The freshness of Waldhorn makes it special.

I'm ready to go back right this minute."
"NC","Never eaten here so this review is literally only for the Octoberfest  event they host.

One word...fun!  Tons of authentic german music and lots of happy smiley people dancing around and having a ball eating brats and red cabbage.  That's the scene here.  I've been 2 years running and I'm a fan for life.

It can get expensive and note they only take cash.  I had 4 liters of beer (2 people) and 2 brats w/red cabbage and it was $65.  Wow...kinda pricey but remember you are paying for the tents, the music and the chance to really get into the Octoberfest vibe!"
"NC","Waite staff was outstanding. 

My wife and I had two entrees that are difficult to prepare; sauerbraten and roulade. Both were wonderful except for being somewhat dry. Sauerbraten was probably not marinated long enough (needs 5 days).  Roulade should have been browned and then extremely slow roasted.

Black Forest cake was very good and different, just not the best."
"NC","Went there as I was visiting my parents, they took me here for dinner and first weekend of Oktoberfest.  I recall having a great German meal about 14 years ago and its always been in my ""top 5 meals ever"" memory, and this place met and surpassed it. We ordered the smoked trout appetizer to get going and nibbled on that with the pretzel rolls dropped off on our table.  Both were great. We had a great server who recommended the beer (a dark wheat, can't recall the exact name) and the sampler plate. I shrugged off the sampler plate as too easy a selection, but went with it anyway.  It was phenomenal - noodles, the sauce, the brat, the rouladan (sp?) meat thing, and pork slice was so tasty. Servings were huge, none of us finished it. After dinner we got free passes to the beer tent outside, headed there for more beer and great band for few hours. Overall, great happy employees, great food, and just a wonderful evening, worthy of the 5 stars."
"NC","OUTSTANDING experience at Waldhorn this evening.  We started out with the sausage and sauerkraut appetizer with 3 kinds of sausage - very good.  The pretzel rolls were very tasty too.  I had the roasted duck with bread dumplings and red cabbage - great.  We ended our terrific food experiences with an apple strudel and a piece of black forest cake - wow    Service was great."
"NC","My family of (4) went to Waldhorn for Sunday brunch today.  We had been a couple of times in the past, but not for approximately 5 years.  After our first few bites, we all asked why we waited so long to go back?!?  (I will get back to this later in the review)

The positives for us:
~ Great selection of lunch and breakfast foods
~ The Pretzel Rolls were ridiculously delicious!!  I never tried them before because I had an impression that the roll would be heavy and dense like a typical pretzel and that is not the case at all.  They are fluffy with a nice chewy crust and bits of pretzel salt...add a smear of butter and OMGosh!  For a split-second I was tempted to dump the entire basket into my oversized Coach purse, but thankfully I came to senses quickly!  LOL
~ The German offerings (Schnitzel, Sauerbraten, Brats, Kielbasa, etc) were all very good.
~ Fresh Omelet station with a nice selection of toppings

The service was just ok.  At one point, my son had a dirty plate on the table and he went up to get another plate (including a fresh-made omelet) and the dirty plate was still at the table when he returned.  I'm also on the fence with the desserts.  They weren't consistent.  The Black Forest Cake was excellent, but other items were just ok.  I suspect that they are not fresh made onsite....and some even tasted pre-frozen.

A (major) negative for us was that the fresh carved Roast Beef VERY tough and gristly.  It couldn't be cut with the standard flatware knife.  We had to ask for ""sharp"" knives.  Considering that this was ""the"" big ticket food item (and the one item that I was looking forward to the most), I was really disappointed in the quality of the meat.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the price for (4) with gratuity was $111.00.  I was surprised to see that the prices for (4) not-so-great mass-produced coffees and (2) very small servings of juice was $20.00!   I have no problem spending $100+ for a meal that I really loved, but I didn't feel that way with this meal.  I liked it just fine, but it wasn't outstanding by any means.  As I signed my name to the check and tried to reconcile the price vs. value, I then realized why we hadn't been there in 5 years."
"NC","My daughter and I love this restaurant and we're not even close to being German. LOL.  Our waitperson, Annette, was wonderful. I tried a different dish today and didn't like it (not used to some German foods I guess) although I did like the sides. Long story short, the manager did not charge me for my entree.  I did not ask him to do that. We had the apple streusel with ice cream for dessert. It is to die for. We love the sausage appetizer.  We will definitely return. Great atmosphere too."
"NC","For 9 years, i have lived only 3 miles away from the best brunch in town. I just realized this a day ago.  Made to order omelets, roast beef carving station,  salad/soup, potato salad, brats, sausages, pork, pretzel rolls, bacon, more pork, veggies, french toast, grits and other normal breakfast fare, rice, pasta, chicken, apple/cherry cobbler, tons of deserts....oh my the deserts. Everything was very very good. It was very hard to force myself to stop eating and when we left i could barely move.
Some may think its a little pricey but at $17/ per person it is way worth it for the selection and quality of food. Another great thing is that its not predominantly just breakfast foods. There is something for everyone. I thought the service was awesome. Our server and the guys at the roast beef/omelet station all told me about their Oktoberfest and encouraged me to attend. Guess i look like i really dig beer (well, it's true). 
I'm not sure what additionally i can say that previous reviews haven't already said...ill just echo that if you haven't been to this brunch yet-your definitely missing out!"
"NC","OMG! Why or why have I never been here before now. This place is awesome, in so many ways. First the atmosphere was perfect. A very casual feel. There's a bar that you can walk up to sit down order a great pint of beer. Second the waitstaff is extremely knowledgeable. Third the food all my God is so good.  The portion sizes are great. We will be going back definitely."
"NC","Maybe I just don't like German food but was very unhappy with all the food I tasted. It could have been what I ordered? I was disappointed with the selection of food as well. I ordered a Chicken Salad Sandwich and it had way too much sauce on it. My husband let me try a bite of his Rueben which was really good. My kid's loved the authenticity of the restaurant which made it worth it to see them so happy. I wouldn't choose to go back but I am guessing it's probably b/c German food isn't my thing."
"NC","If you enjoy German food, then this is the absolute BEST place in the area.  They have pretzel dough rolls that are just the bomb!  Lets also not forget to mention the copious amounts of awesome imported German beer!!"
"NC","Went there for lunch not overly crowded but there was no hostess,  after about 5 minutes a waitress came and seated us.  

Had the bratwurst sandwich on a pretzel hoagie with fries.  It was ok nothing special.  Our waitress was slow and never came to give is refills. 

I'd  give it another try   But it was just ok.  I could get the same sandwich at Jason's deli"
"NC","Have been looking for a great German restaurant for years and found on while on a work assignment in Charlotte. With my wife visiting we went here for dinner. Having german food while growing up, standards were high to meet expectations set by my mother's cooking. We both had the sauerbraten with red cabbage and spetzel.  The meat was obviously marinated in wine, vinegar and spices for several days (waitress told me 6 days) because it was both tender and very tasty. I have had sauerbraten in other restaurants and all they did was flavor the gravy and not take the time to marinate the meat.  Had the strudel for dessert which also great warm with a side of ice cream.  Do not forget to try one of the beers. Great assortment of german beers. Looking forward to returning and trying other dinners!"
"NC","Schnitzel bonanza! I came here with my family for a nice German time, plus I was craving for a schnitzel for months since I came from San Fran. Inside the ambiance is very lets say, German feeling (not that I've been to Germany... But from pictures I can imagine, right?) high ceilings and wooden support beams cover this restaurant. The wooden beams are Covered with fliers of Spaten German beer which gives a feeling of Germany party feeling.

So let's get to the food. I got schweitzer schnitzel (I believe) which is breaded pork stuffed with swiss cheese and ham. It was delicious (but I think San Fran still has it for me). Inside there was black forest ham, which gave it an extra touch of it and it oozed out Swiss cheese.

Other dishes were pork tenderloin and pan fried ham of pork topped with an egg. They didn't think it was bad because it was healthy and wasn't too oily nor salty. 

For dessert we ordered some ice cream with peach schnapps topped with raspberry. It was okay, the raspberry had a hint of sourness but at the same time the ice cream balanced the sour taste. It was an interesting combination.

Overall, I felt pretty good about this restaurant considering its in Charlotte and one of the only German restaurants the city offers. They fulfilled my tummy and I will come here if I crave for schnitzels, maybe try another type of schnitzel next time."
"NC","So I've yet to go to the Waldhorn for lunch or dinner?  Why, then, am I reviewing it, you ask?

The answer: OMG brunch buffet.

Ok, so at $16 and change, the weekend brunch buffet isn't cheap. But it is plentiful and delicious. Omelettes are made to order (and made well, at that), and there smorgasbord of other selections: everything from pasta to rice to sausage to cake.

Of special note are the sausages and the red cabbage. Especially the red cabbage. If you think cabbage can't be so good as to give you daydreams, well, you haven't had the cabbage here. Even a brunch attendee native to Germany agreed with me on that.

The staff is friendly and attentive (even though we were difficult and changed tables!) and the decor is entertaining.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because I haven't experienced a full-service meal here yet.  I suspect that is just a matter of time, however."
"NC","The 1st time I have ever ate at this location. You really have to enjoy german food in order to appreciate some of the dishes that is server on the brunch buffet during Sundays. The food that I ate was very tasteful and I really enjoyed being there. During their sunday brunch they will also make omlets on demand with all sorts of different fillings and toppings."
"NC","Oktoberfest.  Live it.  Love it.  We've gone for my husband's birthday the past 2 years, and it has never failed to disappoint.  SO BUSY though, so book your reservations well in advance or you'll be waiting hours at the door.  The atmosphere is so fun and lively, and you wouldn't look a bit out of place in your lederhosen!  So drag it out of the closet!  I know you have a pair (a set?).  

The food is, as the other reviews say, wunderbar.  Unbelievable saurkraut.  Pretzel bites are the bomb.  Sausage sampler, exquisite.  They have a special menu for the fest, and I haven't been back to try the non-fest-fare, but it seems to me like anything you pick would be a winner.

But hands down the best part of Oktoberfest?  The accordion guy.  He is the jam.  He played the Pennsylvania Polka for us Steeler fans, and it was magical (sorry QC peeps, you won't get that, and it's okay).  Just give this guy some love because he's awesome.

I'll post an update if I can ever make it back for Sunday Brunch!"
"NC","When I exit my car last night, I felt almost like in Munich. Building both outside and inside looks as European as it gets around here. 12 kinds of German beer on tap caused my frist explosion of joy and then it got even better. We ordered four different dishes, each and every one prepared exactly as it would be back home. My orange duck was particularly impressive, especially with extra sauerkraut on the side. Very nice service convinced me to come back soon, maybe for Sunday brunch 'all you can eat', even if only to try all the remaining menu positions at once. I have to consider moving closer to this place and get my Beer Club membership."
"NC","This place is delicious. Its not cheap. I can't seem to recall where the owners are from. 

Lunch time is about the best time to go to this place. The lunch specials are still on the high end, but they don't suffer in quality. Unfortunately, I cannot attest to anything but how delicious the weinerschntizel is. I can't seem to bring my self to try anything else. However, the portions could be a little larger. 

In the evening, they serve soft and warm pretzel rolls with the meal. They are also delicious. This is one of the best German places that I've been to in the US. 

The Oktoberfest is not something to be messed with. They pull off the more traditional approaches. Its a tent, and its well managed. There are complaints about the whole ticket system. But given NC/US's weird alcohol rules, they make it work."
"NC","THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR BRUNCH. IF IT IS SUNDAY BEFORE 230PM AND YOU ARE READING THIS - STOP. GO TO THE WALHORN. THEN RETURN TO SAID YELP REVIEW AND THANK ME. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THIS IS VERY REAL.

Sometimes there are things in life that you just can't express in words full how much such and such means to you. Or how much you hate it. Or love it. This is ALMOST one of those cases, but for you fine people I will spit some lyrical truth about this epic brunch.

Best roast beef in the land
Sliced by hand,
On your Command,
Delish.

Breakfast foods ye seek,
Might as well get 2 plates,
French toast and hashbrowns peak,
Under all that bacon.

Sausages are varied,
Mustard with them - heaven.
Sauerbraten, sauerkraut, spaitzel
Oh look, schnitzel - I'll have 7

I love you Waldhorn Brunch.
I want to spend my life with you.
This isn't a poem.
BRB going for another trip (and don't skip dessert!)"
"NC","AMAZING FOOD, AMAZING BEER!!!! I love this place!

Best European Food in Charlotte, besides my mother's of course...."
"NC","Best Sunday brunch in Charlotte. Period. I could stop there, but I'll go on.

Great German beers and German delicacies on the buffet line, including sauerbraten, pork loin cooked with bacon, red cabbage, sauerkraut, you name it. The only thing I didn't see was weiner schnitzel, but maybe they have that on other Sundays? Plus of course, all the usual Sunday breakfast things - an omelette station, scrambled eggs, bacon, grits, etc. And an assortment of dessert items.

Great service with a smaller-sized dining area that helps keep the meal intimate.

I've not been here for a meal other than brunch, but I will absolutely do so and let you know.

Note: Check their website for the Oktoberfest schedule. The place gets crazy busy and I'm not exaggerating. They have local cops here to direct traffic!"
"NC","My suggestion to all restaurants:  

Pick something to do, then be excellent at doing it.

Waldhorn does authentic German cuisine, and they are excellent at it!
I joined their beer club during my first visit this week, which gained me a 0.5 liter stein, $0.50 off future beers in my stein, a cheap buffet full of yummy choices every Tuesday night, and other discounts that I can't remember.  All that for a one-time $28 membership fee.  Sold!
The beer:  oh, man.  My favorites are the Spaten Dunkel and Oktoberfest.  They have Warsteiner, Paulaner, Tucher, and many other German staples.  This place is the real deal - the decor is very nice, the atmosphere is a European family-dining feel, and it just feels friendly.  The manager is super-nice, greeting everyone as they enter, telling us about future events, current specials, and other choice info.  All the servers are delightful, and I will be back here many times.
I'll have to space out my visits, though; German food is HEAVY!
I had the jagerschnitzel (my absolute favorite German dish); they did me right!

Like I said, they are excellent at what they do.  My compliments, Waldhorn."
"NC","Full disclosure here, I'm part German, I'm married to a German, I've traveled to Germany once and I really love beer. Ok, so we hit up Waldhorn last night for my dad's 75th birthday and Oktoberfest. We had dinner inside before moving out to the tent. We got some apps to start, potato pancakes & a brats tray. The pancakes w/ apple sauce were fantastic, nice & crispy edges too. Brats were Brats, excellent. I also enjoyed the sauerkraut. For the entree, I ordered the Sauerbraten. It was ok. I didn't care for the spatzle, it was just a little soft for my liking but the red cabbage was tasty & the beef had good flavor but a little over cooked. Next time, I'll go with the brats! For dessert I had the apple strudel. Now this is a dessert!! I'll go back just for the apple strudel anytime, it was that good!  Full of flavor w/ a nice sprinkle of cinnamon on top of everything, including the ice cream. Great presentation too! After dinner we moved to the tent. As some of the others have said, there were lines everywhere. Since we had dinner there, we got into the tent for free but still had to stand in line to buy beer tickets and then another line to buy beer. They moved pretty quickly. Oh, the beer was awesome. I was drinking the Oktoberfest. Lots of people under the tent and all around and everyone was having a good time. All in all, we had great time and it's as close to Germany as you'll find in the Charlotte area."
"NC","This review is just for Oktoberfest in the tent- not for dining in the restaurant. In years past, we have eaten indoors first and then headed out to the tents for the music and festivities.  (You might want to do this if you prefer a quieter meal with better selection of foods.)  But this year, we just went for the tent. 

If you are planning to go to Oktoberfest at Waldhorn be prepared to wait in line...at least 3 or 4 times before you can begin to really enjoy yourself. 

First, you wait in line to show your i.d. & pay the cover charge which currently is $3. Then, once you get your wristband and proceed to the tent, you will have to wait in line to buy tickets.  

I really don't care for the way they do the tickets -- you have to buy tickets for specific things.  For example, you buy tickets for single beers or pitchers of beer... you buy a ticket for a pretzel or spätzle or apfelstrudel... and they print out the ticket with the name of the item on it.  

I am guessing that they do it to track how much of each item sells, but it seems like an inefficient system  to me.

It helps to check out their website for the tent menu before you go so that you will know how much cash to take (no debit or credit cards or checks in the tent - it is cash only).

http://www.waldhorn.us/tent_menu.htm

Once you have purchased the tickets, you then have to line up again to get food and drinks. 

Since I don't eat pork or beef, I ate a lite dinner before heading out to the Waldhorn. However, I definitely saved room for some spätzle & a pretzel -yummy!

When I first started going to the 'fest several years ago, it was not nearly as crowded as it is now.  However, the word has definitely gotten out and they are packing them in these days! 

It gets really loud in the tent with all the people talking and the band playing traditional German folk music.  There is also a small stage set up in front of the band, so get ready to do the chicken dance.  Don't worry, no matter what time you go out, you'll have a chance to do it.  (I think they played it at least 5  times over the course of the evening). 

Of course, parking when you arrive can be a challenge, but if the parking lots are already full when you arrive, you can park next door at the James K Polk memorial or just around the corner at the furniture stores on Carolina Place parkway. 

All in all, despite the weird ticketing system, the lines, and challenges in finding a place to sit, it can still be a lot of fun! Prost!"
"NC","Let me start by saying this. If it's lunch...

ORDER A PRETZEL ROLL...or maybe 3! (They're free with dinner, or at lunch they're $1.) Crunchy exterior (but not hard) sprinkled with sea salt and served with pats of butter. 

Can I admit, I wish I hadn't offered my husband half of mine, so I could have eaten the whole thing?  Silly Dion. 

But besides that, Waldenhorn's food is authentic German, set in a comfortable, homey setting with friendly servers.  Lots of beers on tap, served by the liter and half liter. 

Lunch is usually served until 3pm, but on Saturdays it's 4pm.  I had the special of the day, the Rindsrouladen, which is braised beef rolled with cabbage, onions, pickle and bacon.  It was served with spatzel and green beans.  

I ate the entire thing!  The meat is so tender, the spatzel nice and buttery (their spatzel is more like long thin noodles, not little pellet shapes BTW) and even the green beans were nice and crisp and garlicky.  No mushy beans here! 

My husband got the weinershnitzel, and it was pounded perfectly thin and uniform, crisp on the outside and tender and moist on the inside.  The fries are the thin, super crispy kind (Think BK...but better. Strange comparison, I know.) and more of those yummy crisp green beans. He too ate it all!

Our server was very good at explaining each menu item to us, and didn't steer us wrong with her recommendations. She even came by to ask if we wanted more gravy...which we did, and could have sopped up 5 pretzel rolls with the stuff! 

Prices were reasonable.  Sandwiches about $7-$9 and the lunch entrees about $10 to $11. 

Can't wait to go back and try dinner (Complete with accordion player!?) or their brunch buffet. Oktoberfest is coming up too, which includes live music and festivities."
"NC","This is one of those places I really want to LOVE for some reason!  So I was glad to go back for lunch today and get the items I liked last time and taste something new.  The service was very good last time, today it was even better.  My choice today was the ""International Hoagie"" This was very Good an easy 4 yelp stars of: Roast Beef, Westphalian Ham, Salami, Turkey, Fleischkaese, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce and Tomato on a fantastic Pretzel Hoagie Roll.  This usually is served with Tarragon-Balsamic Mayonnaise, which I asked them to leave off.  The only other change I asked was to add onions.  This sandwich was very good!  French Fries were offered with this sandwich though I substituted the delicious ""Home Fries"" cooked with bits of Bacon...5 yelp stars Yum!  For Dessert I had ""Schokoladenmus"" Chocolate Mousse served with Bourbon Sauce and Fresh Fruit, it was A-OK 3 yelp stars.  The next course was five Pretzel Rolls looking great on a plate (see photos of all this if you like).  The next course, was a course of action to pay and get out before i ordered more food!  Oktoberfest here starts Friday September 23 and is for the weekends only (four weekends Fridays and Saturdays).

Next time I'll be there for dinner and eat outside."
"NC","This is probably close to what most people expect for German food.  My expectations are high and I am a hypocrite for sure in almost everything!  With that understood...  read on:  The Pretzel Roll was very good (4.75 stars),  The kinda cubed and Fried Potatoes cooked with Bacon (called fries) ROCKED (5 yelp stars)!!! The service was very good, very team oriented.   Though I was pointing at what I wanted on the menu it took my server four guesses to get what I wanted.   It was impressive to me that he made sure!   Two waiters and a manager helped serve my table (I'm always impressed by a great team) so the service gets 4.9 yelp stars!

When I go German I want BRATS!!!  So I had the Two Brat Lunch Platter (may be called something else) with Sour Kraut and a side of Red Cabbage!  One of the Brats was Good as in Maybe 3.5 yelp stars which means I would not get it again!  The other Brat was OK maybe 2.5 (I'm thinking that is generous though).  The gravy with the Brats was good and the mustard was very good and spicy.  Goulash (not spelled as they did) was in a thick ""hunteresk"" type of homey (not the clown) gravy.  I took several small tastes to get the vegetables and meat and hesitate to give it a 2.25 yelp stars because I bet this is the flavor many people want!  Warm Sour Kraut was fresh (not canned) and was A-OK (3 yelp stars)  Warm Red Cabbage same story different flavor (less than three stars though).

For Dessert I should have gone somewhere else (and I did after I had it here).  The lady (maybe Manager/Owner? I'm guessing?) described the Black Forest Cake as being ""lite"" !  When dinning out or in or anywhere ""lite"" is usually (not always) NOT how I want most Desserts described!  Usually I want to hear:  Rich, sweet, creamy, Chocolaty, H E A V Y !  !   !  Calorie Laden and FULL of flavor!  Calories!  It's Friday, can't I be bad as I want to be one day (worse than I say I am too much of the time).  As my servers could tell I was not a small fan of the Black Forrest Cake - Not a small fan, not a fan at all!

Herman the German was right!  Though I had to find out for my self!  I would go back now that I know some of what I do like and some of what I do not...  There were some other menu items I would check out!"
"NC","solid place.  excellent beer selection.  food is very good. prices are decent."
"NC","Fairly authentic german food. Great atmosphere. Liked it more before I actually went to Europe and had actual german food. Never going to be quite the same but I still love it! Good place to go for something different and tasty!"
"NC","This place makes me feel right at home.  Warm and personable, the Waldhorn offers a cozy atmosphere to drink some quality beer on tap.  Mmmm...no skunky green-bottle taste!

The food isn't by any means anything special...it's just typical German food.  You either like it or you don't.  This guy...does!  And...what would a German restaurant be without some accordian music?  There's just something about polka that makes me want to drink more.  Hmmm?

The service is excellent, the atmosphere is warm, the food is filling, the prices are reasonable, and you'll feel like part of the family.

Das Waldhorn ist ausgezeichnet!"
"NC","Loved it!"
"NC","One of my favorite restaurants, can't quite put my finger on why, maybe it's the atmosphere the great German beer.  Just always great food, the pretzel rolls I could eat all day. 
Always there at least 4 times a year."
"NC","This place is yummy!  We had great food and wonderful service.  Admittedly I am not completely familiar with GERMAN food, but I am familiar with GOOD food, and this food was GREAT!  The flounder was spot on!  And the bread pudding?  Mmmmm, salivating just thinking about it!  The kids really enjoyed their ice cream clowns and now I just need to come up with another excuse to go back to Waldhorn.  We live too far out to be regulars!  Bummer!"
"NC","Love this place for German Food.   Have to try the Sunday Brunch next time. Heard it was very good."
"NC","The Rindroulaten with a Franziskaner Hefeweizen is awesome."
"NC","You don't have to wear lederhosen to come to Waldhorn, but my theory has always been that it never hurts to wear lederhosen.  Wearing a fun outfit is just good times right off the bat.  

I've eaten at Walhorn 8 or 10 times over the last couple years and love everything about Gitta's restaurant.  All of the food is excellent and I especially like the $5.50 ""buffet"" that is available to Waldhorn Beer Club members on Tuesday nights.  I won't outline any particular meal for you because I've tried quite a few of them and have been disappointed by none. And the pretzel rolls are fantastic!  It's the best pretzel bread you've ever wrapped your lips around. They have a wonderful German beer selection and you are given the ability to choose your drink size up to a full liter.  I wish half pints would catch on at more bars Stateside.  

Brian, the restaurant manager, is quite gregarious and will leave you with a smile on your face should you happen to meet him.  After a couple visits to Waldhorn you kinda feel like you're family."
"NC","Went for the buffet on Sunday.  As another reviewer said it was set up weird.  Grew up on German food and this didn't compare. Probably good for a restaurant though. Should try ordering from the menu it might be better."
"NC","Went to this place when I had some family in town for the Sunday brunch buffet.

The food was pretty decent.  My grandpa is from Germany and my mom often made German food for us growing up.  It wasn't exactly like my mom's but I thought it was pretty good compared to other German places I have tried.

I was not impressed with the lay out of the buffet.  Kind of had to stand in an awkward line where people weren't really sure where they were going or who was in line and who wasn't.  

I would have loved to see Rouladen on the buffet as that is one of my favorites...I know they have it on the regular menu though."
"NC","Driving around Pineville at night, you're in Close Encounters - on this dark, twisty road and all of a sudden BAM the bright lights of some delicious Germanic Castle shine bright in the eyes.  

Inside, it's a mix - diner meets hall, flags and Spaten gear everywhere. Most importantly - this is the only place in CLT to get a full liter of delicious, German beer. 10 bucks. Reasonable. Even Erk's huge paws get dwarfed by such a stein.

I figured eating here would be spatzle only - fine, I'll have more bier - but no, there's actually a sweetly-done entree to be had - veggies wrapped in puff pastry, sliced, sauced with red pepper puree that had a creamy, somehow sharp bite. $13 makes it a tad pricey, and dinner entrees climb from that. Latkes (er, whoops) were lovely - croquettes as well. Kasespatzle on the kiddie's menu rounded out our carb party and was super-enjoyable - sliced thin, like linguine, seeking a Fettucine Alfredo-style dish - I like mine more dumpling, but still satisfying.  

Pretzal rolls? Hot mustard? Huge booths? Great service. OMB's Dunkel on tap, along with the big hits - Franziskaner (light AND dark, huzzah), Bitte burger, Warsteiner, Weihenstephaner. 

Wish it was closer."
"NC","While I do revel in trendy, upscale, ""nouvelle cuisine"" type places, (and no, I did not just make that up...) I have to give credit where credit is due.

""We're going to Waldhorn for dinner.""  ""A Wal what??""--my reply.  Waldhorn is a German restaurant in the Matthews area.  It's not easy to drag me away from my comfort zip codes, but this turned out to be a treat.  

No frills here.  As other reviewers have noted, the ""investigation lighting"" was off putting.  If I have peppercorns in my teeth, I would rather find out about it after my meal.  Our waitress was super friendly and gladly dimmed the lights for us.  Nice, friendly staff! 

We started with the bratwurst sausage appetizer plate and the ""Gebackenber Ziegenkase,"" which is goat cheese, spinach and sundried tomatoes stuffed in a phyllo dough pastry.  The sausage came with sauerkraut (I am a fan) and a spicy mustard.  I favored the smoked wurst and ate the spicy mustard until my sinuses were clear.  No Day Quil required!

For my entree, I wanted something straight up German.  I opted for the Sauerbraten.  This is a braised marinated beef dish served with spatzle and red cabbage.  I had never had spatzle, but it is a fettucini-esque noodle with more texture.  I loved the texture of these noodles.  The beef and gravy that it came with were delicious.  Tender and bursting with flavor.  

Ooh, and the beer I ordered (a wheat beer whose name I can't remember) came in a tall cylindrical glass that made me feel like something special!

The meal was hearty and delicious. Lots of male customers.  I wouldn't typically crave or think about this type of food, but for what it was, it was an enjoyable experience!"
"NC","Used to be so good...but the food and service has deteriorated in the last few years.

Carpaccio....one of my favorite items on their menu is now served without toast points. You must request them...then they only bring a few. Last time it was served on a very hot plate...by the time we got the toast, some if the carpaccio was cooked. Horrible.

I have enjoyed the venison dish in the past...it was always tender and succlent. Last visit, it was so rare and chewey I could not enjoy it. I asked the waitress about it, and she replied, ""They've always cooked it rare"". 

The crab cakes: I know that most German menus probably don't include crab cakes! But, most nice restaurants do, so it is pretty standard fare. Their crab cakes are very crabby, but also include either tuemeric or curry, which is entirely unexpected, and does not add to the dish.

Their famous salad: The Waldhorn salad, baby greens towering over delicious cucumber salad, orzo salad, carrot salad and delicious german potato salad. This dish is just amazing! For us, it is the only reason to return to Waldhorn's!

Bring your own water, service is spotty most times....and I've observed that we aren't always the only ones with empty glasses!

We've liked Waldhorn for over 10 years....but this weekend was probably our last visit."
"NC","My credentials:  I was born in Germany, lived for years in Germany, my mom (the best cook ever) was German, and I currently run a US business selling German Food.  I love this restaurant and visit every time I travel through Charlotte.  Their Roasted Duck is a thing of beauty (succulent with crispy skin..and a sauce that is sweet but not overwhelming).  I have a wheat allergy and the wait staff and chef went out of their way to steer me away from anything bad-for-me.  All 9 in our party this last time (July 10, 2010) were delighted with the food.  Not a single complaint.  They came in 10th in the nation in a competition for the Best German Restaurant in America (see  BestGermanRestaurant. com) and I'm already looking forward to dining there again."
"NC","set in a renovated Tudor style house, this restaurant makes you feel like you've stepped out of the country; from the Stammtisch to the man playing the accordion, there's nothing else like the Waldhorn in the Charlotte area. But please, let the food speak for itself. Prices are around the same price you would find at any other casual dining restaurant, however, the golden ticket is found on Sunday mornings for the Waldhorn's brunch. Here you will find the majority of the foods that are offered in their menu, and their slef made deserts."
"NC","Visited the Waldhorn last Friday evening in attempt to fit in the last weekend of their Oktoberfest Celebration.

When I think of where I want to eat, German food doesn't exactly jump to the front of the line... but after going to the Waldhorn - I'm definitely a fan and to have a german restaurant in Charlotte/Pineville is a real treat.

The parking situation was a bit crazy since I guess it was the last weekend for Oktoberfest so everyone was trying to get their Waldhorn on that night (and I'm sure the night after that).  I ended up parking at the James K. Polk memorial center and walking up to the restaurant.  

I had a large group of people with me from the office so getting a table took a little bit of time.  We had someone go early and put in our names for a group of 10.

When we finally got seated, our waitress was very nice and understanding since it is sometimes hard to order with the traditional German vernacular - Lots of pointing and the waitress finishing our sentences were involved.  

I had the Bratwurst Platte and enjoyed every bit of it.  There were 3 types of bratwurst on the plate along with a healthy portion of sauerkraut.  I cleaned my plate along with a LITER of Spaten Oktoberfest (amber ale) that was heaven.  The waitress kept a basket of bread/pretzel bread full and they were nice a hot out of the oven.

After diner, we proceeded to go into the tent behind the restaurant to enjoy the German band, dancing, festivities, and more beer.  Definitely a great way to celebrate Oktoberfest!"
"NC","Just came back from their Sunday Brunch. It was about $15 per person unless you have kids under 4 which are free. The brunch is a great way to try a lot of items in one sitting. They have an omelet station which was decent but I came for the German food. Also at the omelet station was roast beef which was just OK. They have about 30 other lunch items on the buffet. The best part by far is the dessert section which included about 10 additional items. It was not the best German I have had but I would not expect that from a buffet. I will be back to try a menu item another day. 

The staff was very friendly and the building had a great German feel."
"NC","Having been in Charlotte only a year, I'd despaired of finding good German cuisine in the QC.  Turns out you have to go to Pineville.  Also turns out it's well worth the drive.

The Waldhorn is a little kitschy, but appropriately so.  Their tap selection is well-chosen and good.  The rolls are pretzel-y and fantastic.  The sauerkraut is sauer enough, though they do the sweet caraway-seed version.  The wurst is the best in Charlotte.  (Please don't kill me.)

We started with the wurst plate, served with mustard, sauerkraut and rolls.  There was plenty, and I should've stopped there, but I hadn't had good German food in a while, and was in a celebratory mood.

I had the jagerschnitzel.  It was made entirely of food.  Pork was thin, crispy and delicious.  Red cabbage was firm and sweet.  Spätzle needed salt, but it usually does.  Heated up well the next day, also--there was a lot of it.

She had the venison.  Sweet lord.  That is all.

An older gentleman in liederhosen and wielding an accordion played throughout the place, but never so loud as to be distracting.  I like the accordion though, so your mileage may vary.

It is a little pricier than I would've liked, but I don't think that is going to stop me from going back.  Regularly."
"NC","Great restaurant. Has a mug club that is worthwhile if you go here a lot. Their food is great, especially the pretzel rolls you get.  The beer selection is vast.

Oktoberfest is a great time as well. A polka band plays while you eat and enjoy authentic German food."
"NC","Due to my job I travel weekly and eat out a ton so I'm pretty hard to impress.  With that being said I LOVE this place!  Every time I go the food is great and the beer is awesome.  If you have never tried the Waldhorn you should check it out, I think you will be impressed."
"NC","Tonight was my first time here, and I think I'm in love. The beer selection is fantastic (you had me at Weihenstepher), the service was great, and the food was really, really good. I ordered the Wurst Platte, which, as it's name suggests, is a plate of sausages--three different kinds, to be exact, with a side of kraut and home fries. There was also a perfect dribbling of jaeger sauza to go with it. I've always like kraut, but not loved it. This stuff, I loved. It actually had a slightly sweet flavor to counteract the normal tang of kraut. My wife had a pork schnitzel that was flayed and stuffed with black forest ham and cheese. Nothing better than stuffing pork with pork, my friends. That was served with a side of spaetzle and broccoli that was actually fresh. 

The old timer walking around playing the accordian was a nice touch and got everyone going. There were a lot of large parties, but we were seated quickly and also served quickly. The location is a little out of the way for a Charlottean, but well worth the trip if you find yourself south of town."
"NC","This is where the birthday girl wanted to go last night so this is where we went.

Best surprise - a free slice of Black Forest cake with the purchase of any two dinner entrees.  This is the Tuesday special and it's large enough for two to share.

Table ordered the wienerschnitzel, sauerbrauten and chicken nadia.  Three entrees, two glasses of wine, one large draft beer, a cup of coffee and the free Black Forest cake ran $80 including tip."
"NC","Went for dinner. Sat down in a nice booth with a ""CIA interrogation room"" light bulb for lighting. Please take the wattage below 100 watts 

Ordered a sausage variety appetiser, sure would have been nice to know which ones were which (for future reference).

Dinner rolls were free.

I enjoyed my Ribeye steak. I can't speak for the others around the table. If you know you're going to eat German food and you know it's going to be ""heavy"" food, then you should enjoy this restaurant. Beer selection is great.

I will return to drink more beer and try more food specials. Overall its good food but the cost might keep me going back frequently."
"NC","Been to Germany? If not, then go. If yes, then no. When I think of German food, I think of the smells of Frankfurt Am Main or the hip little Back Factory spots around Berlin. This place lacks something, it may be Germans. I dunno. Spend 30 bucks on 8 euros worth of food. Do the math it doesn't add up."
"NC","Went back to the Waldhorn this past Sunday for brunch and had a great visit. Normally, I avoid buffets, but their brunch buffet is nice. I love the cooked-to-order omelette station as well as the selection of  traditional breakfast foods and traditional German foods.  The people are friendly, service was good and quality of the food is excellent.  I would definitely recommend giving them a try for brunch even if you are not typically a fan of ""German"" food -- I don't eat beef, pork, cabbage, etc but I can certainly find plenty of other options here that are excellent (Spätzle, Chicken, French Toast, Cheese Grits, Home Fries, Fresh Vegetables, Fresh Soup of the day, and delish fresh breads).  Brunch is also an excellent time to try some of their various desserts  such as fruit cobblers,  Napoleons, Bienenstich Kuchen (Honey cake with cream in the middle and honeyed almonds on top),  Black Forest Cake, Apfelstrudel, Eclairs, and many others."
"NC","I am a fan of the beer selection, and beer selection only- they have a great mix of really good German beer and seem to rotate it seasonally. As for the food, it's not fair for me to comment- I just don't care for German cuisine."
"NC","I dislike when people give low reviews because of uncontrollable factors like other loud guests and too many people.  If it's a good place, you are gonna get both.  And it's a German restaurant for goodness sake.  Ever hear of Octoberfest?  It's not a quiet outing from what I've heard.

The food here is excellent.  From the sausages, to the breads, to the red cabbage, etc.  I have yet to really have a meal I didn't like.  I usually take a good look at the special, since it's usually pretty reasonably priced, and a good mix as well.  I admit the no more free pretzel rolls sucks.  But you know what else sucks?  The economy.  

The selection of beer and wine is pretty good as well.  Usually we go with a big group, and the next time I go, I will make an effort to keep my voice down.  LOL.

If you're looking for good German food in Charlotte, hit it up!"
"NC","Went for lunch today - and very upset that they now CHARGE a $3 fee for a basket of the pretzel rolls at lunch!

Suggestion to the restaurant - simply ask each table if they want bread.  If they say no, you save the cost of the bread.  If they say yes, the bread is likely to be eaten.  

The charge for the bread isn't worth alienating good customers.

BTW, we didn't have an inexpensive lunch.  Tab for four of us - including two glasses of wine, one beer, three after meal specialty drinks, one dessert and the aforementioned basket of rolls - was over $100.  Did the $3 bread really impact the restaurant profit margin that much?"
"NC","I've been to the Waldhorn several times now - and I'm always torn about writing a review!

Place gets high marks for quality and quantity of food - especially the homemade pretzel style dinner rolls (I could make a meal out of those and a beer or two).

Biggest negative for me is the noise level.  We had five people in a large booth - and I could not hear the two people at the other end of my booth!  Compounding the noise problem - the strolling accordian player who wanted to serenade the booth beside us.  I'm sure the accordianist (is that the correct word?) is a very nice person and genuinely wants to add to your Bavarian meal experience.  But I just wished he'd go entertain the other side of the dining room!

Their 10th annual (according to the advertising materials that came with the check) Oktoberfest is coming up.  They run it for three consecutive weekends in September and I understand it's quite the party.  Haven't been yet but am considering it this year."
"NC","This morning we decided to get up and head out for brunch, and what's better than a brunch buffet on a nice Easter Sunday?

Of course, living in Charlotte, that could be a problem.  It's a well-known fact that there are only two brunch buffet resaturants in Charlotte.  One of them can be found at Ballantyne, but it's rather expensive.  Luckily, we have the Waldhorn to come to the rescue (there are a few other restaurants in Charlotte that step up for Easter, but why reward them?).

The only problem is that the Waldhorn was packed.  As early as Wednesday, there were no reservations left.  So we showed up at about 11:30 and took our chances.  The day was nice, so we thought we might sit outside.  No such luck.  The wait was as long as 40 minutes.  Luckily, there were seats at the bar.  With zero wait.  Sweet!  We took them up on the offer and had a great time.

If you go for dinner, be warned that their service can really stink. Even if they are half-full, the service is bad. Glasses can remain half-full as well. Mostly it seems to depend on who else is there - for instance if a large party is ahead of you in line. The best bet is either to sit at the bar or to go for brunch, in which case you're all good."
"NC","Never heard of BJ's until I received a free 60 day membership in the mail.  After visiting this store, I know realize why they send FREE memberships.  I found it extremely off-putting to be greeted by the smell of old food at the entrance.  It has a gloomy atmosphere and is relatively small. 

I was unable to justify spending $50 or $100 for their membership.  Especially, since I didn't see any significant savings on the items that I would be interested in purchasing (paper & cleaning products).   I do think it is cool that they accept coupons and all forms of payment.  

Ultimately,  BJ's is too grimy, smelly and disheveled looking for me.  It is definitely Costco's distant, twice removed cousin."
"NC","Slowest deli department in town. They have no sense of time so you know they don't value you yours. If they are attempting to push you to buy pre-packaged this is a novel and effective way to do so, by delivering the slowest and most impersonal service EVER! Fail BJ's"
"NC","BJ's has an impressive amount of, well, stuff. This big-box store has just about everything you need, and then some. Clothes, furniture, food, you name it. 

There are only 2 of us, but we still manage to buy enough to more than pay for our annual membership. Some of our best savings come from the produce, deli meats (super cheap!!!) and the paper goods. The monthly coupon book they send (also available on-site) yields additional savings. You will also find deep discounts on clothes, vitamins, books and DVDs. 

We rarely have to wait in line for more than a few minutes, and the self check out is very convenient. 

This store is reasonably clean, albeit a little dingy.  (I've seen a lot worse in these stores), The employees have always seemed friendly. 

3 stars for not having fresh-made (on-site) items like its competitors (this is not a deterrent for me), and for always having a nagging salesperson when you walk in. No, really, I still don't want Direct TV. Thank you. The shopping carts could also use some serious maintenance."
"NC","If you've ever been to a Sam's Club (and I was a member a few years back), then the experience at a BJ's will be the same. Gigantic big box store (larger than your typical Wal-Mart) with high bay racks of storage that go all the way up to the ceiling.

BJ's is a membership store and while you can do a trial shop (15% surcharge), you're better off simply joining for $50 a year. Yes, the do have specials and discounts but those are not year round.

As for the stuff, well, there's nearly everything. You might not be able to do a full grocery shop but you can certainly buy up a cartloads worth of stuff and in the process save some money on the bulk. Two-packs of some things seemed to be maybe half-again the price of buying one at Harris Teeter. Others are competitive with what you might find at Wal-Mart.

I was impressed with the decent selection of pet food products, including a 50 pound bag of the same dog food I usually get at Petsmart but $10 cheaper.

So yes, I joined. And I'll be back.

The gas is cheaper than others nearby but it's still more expensive than going to South Carolina."
"NC","What a difference a few years makes! I am a loyal Costco member, I have given up Sam's . I recently got RE-introduced to BJ's. --they have changed a great deal. I think I was there about 8 years ago when they still had a location on Independence. I walked around a bit and left - with out buying anything. But a friend of mine had a new card and she was telling me how it had changed..so I gave it a chance. I was most pleasantly surprised. They have changed..different now, ..some smaller items so You are not buying a CASE of lettuce or a Whole side of beef..even a deli counter to order 1 lb of sliced meat instead of three pounds. Different Brands than Costco, different cuts of fresh meat. I was so impressed I ended up buying a membership for this club! I was happy to be able to buy a salad mix for 2.59 instead of the big bag that goes bad if you don't use it night after night. I like the fresh meat counter, so far everything I have bought has been great! Good prices on wine also...kind of a mixed bag as to what you get - I noticed that it changed from week to week. So although its not as big as Costco..its well worth the investment. They also have self checkout which was great - because there was no line..I would say --give it another try if you haven't been there in a few years..I think they are changing their image!!"
"NC","A challenger to Costco, which seems to be working as the nearest Costo is in Matthews, located well to the east.

Not as large, but plenty of volume items.  Prices in some cases are better than Costco.

When you join you get a bunch coupons and a $50 restaurant gift card.  Pretty good,. even if you end up not liking the place.

Helpful staff, butcher shop and the samplers frequented by seniors who are chatting them up and eating their lunch via their generosity and patience.  They look so foolish, and I am 67 so can criticize.

If you are in the Indian Land, Ft. Mill and south Charlotte area BJ's is convenient."
"NC","I had a 60 day free membership to be Bj's, the only reason I even went in there.  Let me state that I have been a member of Costco for over 12yrs,do I do have a bias towards Costco  over Sams club or bj' s, but I figured I'd try it. First,  the selection in fruits and vegetables was horrible, one of my favorite areas in Costco....  The selection in other areas such as clothing was NOT impressive.  Overall, a waste of my time even trying them.  There is a reason Costco is the #1 wholesale warehouse site..."
"NC","First time visiting this BJ's Wholesale Club. We found it cause we were almost out of gas in Pineville and needed fuel. 

This BJ's is huge and overwhelming. They have tons of stuff. You can spend the whole day here going from aisle to aisle. Make a list of the items you are shopping for or else you get distracted. It's like a department store here.

I still like the BJ's in Mooresville for they have the lovely sample ladies with products for you to try. At this Pineville location there was not many sample stations.

BJ's makes the best bagels. Nothing compares to NYC bagel, but the BJ's bakery makes the bagels just like NYC. I am totally hooked."
"NC","BJ's is close to my house and having a few kiddos requires us to buy a few things in bulk which saves us some $$ over going to Target or *GASP* Wal-Mart.  

I generally go in with tunnel vision, because if my eyes start straying, before I know it my buggy is filled up with random cool things they have like Ginsu Knives, Brita Bottle, Ceramic Cooker, whole pork shoulder etc...

They have great prices and they have a nice selection of just about anything you want.  Checkout is a breeze and they send out a nice coupon booklet every so often for additional savings.  We saved $45.00 with our coupons at checkout today...Score!"
"NC","Bulk Shopping!!!!

I enjoyed shopping at this BJ's signed up for my free 60 day membership, just to give it a try and see what I thought. 

Overall, it was a plesant experience. The staff was very nice, the store was clean and easy to move around. I liked the variety and selection of items.

Great coupons too, and they take any and all credit cards as well as coupons from outside vendors. Which in my opinion is a pretty cool perk!

Look forward to going back!"
"NC","60 day trail membership! Free! I tried Bj's out and it is great! I still like Costco better. Bj's doesn't have a big produce section. It is nice that they let you use manufacturers coupons!"
"NC","FREE 60-Day Membership - WARNING.  I got a coupon for a Free 60 day Membership from a Valpak mailing to my house.  My wife had me go there to claim the membership and get some Milk.  BJ's Customer Service informed me that I would have to buy a $40 dollar one year membership that I could get a refund up to one year.  They basically give you the first 60 days free, then 12 additional months for $40, then $50 the next year after that.  They should just state.  The first 14 months are refundable if you decide to cancel.  Seemed a bit complicated to me.  Is this actually a promotion?  It is definitely not 60 days FREE with no questioned asked."
"NC","I can't believe I haven't written a review for BJ's yet. I practically live there. When we moved to South Charlotte we researched to see where Costco was. There wasn't one that was close to us. So we looked at what was available. We initially joined Sam's but after a year & not buying much of anything we decided to give BJ's a try.

My wife still shops at other stores but I do the bulk of my shopping at BJ's. Why? Well its very convenient to my house. I live about 5 miles away. They're gas is pretty inexpensive compared to other pumps in the S. Charlotte/Pineville area. THey have a great selection of food. I like being able to buy food from them that can make three or four meals rather than one buying from Harris Teeter. They often have strange flavors of ice cream for sale that are cheaper than some of the national brands. They also have a great bakery. Like other wholesale clubs they carry a variety of merchandise other than food. 

Its a good place to look for movies. Best Buy used to be my go to store for movies. But they're prices are too high & their selection is terrible. 

The other thing I really like about BJ's is that the employees are friendly. When I stopped in yesterday the girl manning the door, Gussie, had just received an award marked by a golden name badge for being an exceptional employee. We talked for a bit & she told me about her manager Rusty, (looks like Penn Gillette), and the way that the managers have been supportive & mentoring.

Anyhow I find BJ's to offer great value for the money with friendly employees & good prices for gas."
"NC","This Starbucks introduced me to the proverbial 3.00 a cup of delicious coffee. Once in there I realized quickly why people come back.  The coffee is wonderful but so are the  staff.  Always accommodating and offering a greeting and friendly smiles it's evident the baristas like being there as much as I did. Two thumbs up on this small quaint little place of wonderful"
"NC","Clean and courteous location, very small as most mall Starbucks locations are but I like this one best of the two located in the mall as this one is original"
"NC","Go back and forth on this location.  MAJOR HASSLE getting in-and-out of 51 in perpetual traffic jam aka Pineville, especially if people get in a rush and don't want to let you in.

Clearly town planners of Pineville sold their souls to developers.  Shame on you.  I remember when it was a sleepy little town prior to 485 with Butler Animal Hospital, Mamma Rosa's and the BK Lounge.  

Gracious, they could have planned that highway / intersection anyway they wanted.  Would love to pummel the traffic flow planners with ball peen hammer. . .but I digress.  

Staff generally pretty nice.  Drive-through ok, not crazy fast but not terrible either.

They make a good cup of Joe if you're on that side of town.  Surprised Starbucks moved in after Bagel Place.  It's just a TERRIBLE traffic flow.  

Giving it a 3* for the staff and good coffee.  I'd give it -5* for location and lack of ease to obtain same."
"NC","This Starbucks was my go-to when I used to work at Carolina Place Mall. 

The thing I love about this particular store is that it should be set up for failure. Terrible, awkward layout, super small, no seating, always busy. 

Still, these guys make it work. Drinks are always quick and delicious. Staff is always ridiculously friendly. When you have baristas who recognized you after not seeing you for about 2 years...you know it's some great service. 

If you're ever in the mall, don't be afraid. Awkwardly wiggly your way up to the register and give these guys a try. And a tip. They really are awesome."
"NC","this is just high priced captain D's. they quality has gone downhill over the past decade now I remember WHY I don't eat here."
"NC","I had my parents over for the weekend and my parents are like most and they are fairly weird. This time the weird discussion revolves around my father and his love of eating establishments in particular  Red Lobster.  I must admit I was biased and am one of those persons that considers Red Lobster the McDonalds of seafood so this would typically not be a place I would visit to eat. 

Surprisingly this visit was very good. I have a few horror stories of other Red Lobster's but this one end with everyone smiling and cheering. We drove to this restaurant in separate vehicles and the first thing I noticed is how far the handicap parking spaces are from the entrance. My parents park in those spaces and it was a hike for them to make it to the front door. I guess they want handicapped parking folks to get the most exercise  to build up for the meal. I am not sure of the planning or thoughts they have on parking. I am just thankful it was a beautiful day. 

Entering the restaurant and all the employees were kind and smiling. They sat us all within about 15 minutes. My father ordered his usual admiral feast, I had a lobster pizza (watching calories). Wife had a pasta dish, my mother had the stuffed founder and my kids had fries. 

It was all delicious! Cooked to perfection and served timely. My father even went out of his way to say this was they best one he has been to in a long time. 



The bill was $101 and that's not bad for 6 people eating. 

I recommend this location."
"NC","The lobster tail was salty. The crab legs were alright. The shrimp was awesome. The asparagus was amazing. All in all it was eh."
"NC","will never go here again b/c for the 3rd time they messed up my to go order. they offered me a gift card one time but never got it. they tried to ""apoligize"" but it was half harted in the apology. they claimed when i was there that all my order was in the bag and when i got home to check it was not. I will never got there again. they are to serve the customers and they are doing a poor job in doing that. they really don't care about the customers and they need to have the check in hand when they are putting the orders together."
"NC","WhAt. A  disapointment......we ordered a salmon plate , my daughter a sirloin and wifey ordered. A shrimp kabobs, we got our drinks at 155 then about 245 we got our plates,food was barely warm, server was alright, though"
"NC","We visited this place during dinner time.waiting queue was big we thought it will take time to get the seat but we are just 2 people so we immediately get the place.we have ordered wood-grilled lobster,shrimp and scallop (split maine lobster tail and skewered shrimp and sea scallops with a buttery garlic finish, over wild rice pilaf) but customized the dish to lobster and shrimp only without scallop.service is very good and we visited this place for the first time so they suggested us which one to take.the dish was good.shrimp and lobster are fresh and we liked the food.awesome taste"
"NC","My wife and her family took me here for my birthday, the service was ok we had about 12 people nothing too big. We had two servers both were pretty nice. We ordered food kept it going like a normal service I got the Bar Harbor and it was pretty awesome I got them to add Cajun seasoning into it since I like spicy food. But rather good couldn't complain.

BUT my wife's grandma got a steak and Lobster, she order a medium and it came out well done and her lobster was raw no idea how this happened considering you cook them at two different times but so be it. She sent it back and by the time she got it back we had already ate all our food and had finished desert. I mean what the heck how does it take that long to cook a medium steak? It doesn't! By the time she got her food she wasn't hungry anymore.

So we get the checks and the server tells me that the manager comped her food since it was messed up and that we wouldn't have to worry about paying for it. Well then they gave her another bill and said that she had to pay for it how the hell that works is beyond me, but she was stuck paying for the damn food that the manager told us we would get credited. 

Near the end of the service the servers lacked and kind of vanished and it was just a huge cluster. The quality of this place just tanked and fell low.

The only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb!!! Everything else is a joke."
"NC","We came here for a working lunch with 5 people. The service although she was very nice was slow. Our food was also timed very poorly with half of it coming out about 10 minutes before the other half. I got the shrimp kebabs with green beans and rice. The food was good, but the shrimps were kind of on the small side. They put 2 together to make them look larger on the skewer. 

The biscuits, like most people know, are the best part. What should have been a 45 minute lunch took around 1.5 hours, although the restaurant looked pretty empty."
"NC","Terribly ran! We will never be back to this location. Food takes forever and it doesn't come out right. The wait staff is slow and management has no clue."
"NC","Food is always really good! Although the service is not all that. First time we went we had a server who was in training and of course we understood if she would make mistakes. Although our second time, the server was slow and did not communicate well. We rarely had refills and was slow to give is our checks and run our cards. Even though it was not very busy. Food is great, service not so much."
"NC","We went to the Red Lobster at Carolina Place this past weekend. The quantity of the food was great; quality was adequate. Service was abysmal. Just as an example, our server brought our ticket to the table. 15 minutes later, she ambled by to pick up the ticket with our credit card. 10 minutes later, she finally brought it back for me to sign. This was after an hour-and-a-half dining experience which should have taken half the time but due to our waitress' slowness and lack of attention, was stretched into painful wait times. Never received a refill on my soda. This was not during prime time, either - we arrived around 4:30PM on Saturday.

As far as the food went, it was good - I had the Admiral's Feast, which I took half of home because it was so much. My wife had the Crab Feast, which she did enjoy. The Cheddar Bay biscuits made up for much, but if I get in the mood for those again, I may just phone in an order and pick it up.

I just hope our server never goes to a zoo; I would hate for her to get dizzy watching the speed of the tortoises there.

As far me, I'm going to give this location a miss moving forward."
"NC","Its a Red Lobster!  Our waitress was awesome and we were here fore the 45 shrimp for $10 promo (im a fatty what do you want).  What better way to stuff your fat face with unlimited cheddar bay (my favorite bay in the whole world) biscuits and then top it off while trying to jam more shrimp down your gullet. The beer was a little flat, the wait was long, but what did we expect?"
"NC","We had a wonderful time!

 We were seated right away and our waiter Jay was friendly and very helpful. We all decided to have the Endless Shrimp. Endless amounts of several different types of shrimp with either a house or Cesar salad and those delicious biscuits!!!! Yummy!

My favorite type was the Parmesan Shrimp. They were very similar to the shrimp scampi, which is another personal favorite but with a delicious cheesy breading....then they are baked again and come out hot and overflowing with cheese. Soooo good!

However, all the other options were great too. We also enjoyed the shrimp pasta which was full of flavor, the fried shrimp that were crispy and the glaze on the Teriyaki Grilled Shrimp was so tasty! 

Our food came out hot and it was really endless....we were stuffed and happy when we left so overall that means it was a great meal and I look forward to going back!"
"NC","Red lobster was not the place to be tonight. Saturday-8/11!!!! The service was horrible. The waiter messed up so bad that we had more free food then we ordered. The appetizer came out after the salad. It seem to be over before it started. It only went down hill from here. I am done with this location. Come on red lobster!!!"
"NC","This has only been my 2nd time at a Red Lobster EVER. It was ok. I have had better seafood elsewhere. The biscuits were by far the star of the show. 

We were seated quickly for a Friday night and the server was fine.

The seafood was a little undercooked and everything was dripping in butter. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE butter but  sometimes too much of a good thing can ruin a meal. The shrimp were TINY and the Lobster Tail was TINY

It was pricey too considering we had 2 Childrens Entrées. The kids mac and cheese was Kraft. Sort of a joke really. $5,99 for Mac and Cheese from a box. When are restaurants going to get a clue and offer more than chicken fingers and mac and cheese on the kids menu? Some kids do have an adventurous spirit and will eat real food.

I may go back for a lunch and their biscuits but will probably pass on them for dinner."
"NC","I have been to many red lobsters before and usually enjoy the food. This was the first one that we have had to wait for a seat, although it was not to long. This place seemed overwhelmed with the crowd. The food was not prepared well. The shell of the crab legs were spongy and bent with the crackers. The baked potato was awful and the service was mediocre. I will not be back to this location"
"NC","""Red Lobster is where America goes for seafood!""
I think that was their one-time slogan. 
This won't be the location I will go for their seafood, anyway. 

I really like Red Lobster. I think it's about the best place to find crab legs locally that are cooked correctly, but it comes at a price.

Let's start with their overpriced drinks: They've got a lot of cocktails to choose from, but they really skimp on the liquor. I don't mind paying upwards of $6-$7 but at least put in some alkie-hall that I can taste.

The biscuits: As long as they come out hot, I have no complaints. Often imitated but never duplicated. These babies will fill you up if you don't watch how many you eat.

The appetizer: Mozzarella Cheesesticks. Meh. They used to have the best years ago but they've messed with the recipe on both the breading and marinara too much over the years.

The salad: I used to favor their Caesar salad over most everyone else, but they've changed and skimped on the dressing. I think I'd rather have their soup.

The meal: The Ultimate Feast. I could not resist. 2 small lobster tails, 1/2 lb of snow crab legs, 4 fried shrimps, and shrimp scampi. I got a side of broccoli because they've once again messed with their recipe on their mashed-potatoes. Their baked potatoes no longer have the skin encrusted in salt. Shrimp, crab, and lobster were great. Broccoli had no flavor. I had to dip in in the butter of the scampi for flavor. Protions seem to have shrunk on a lot of the items though.

The dessert: Warm Chocolate Chip Lava Cookie. One of the best desserts ever although this one was skimpy on the ""lava"".

The location: Never go to Red Lobster on a Sunday. There is no time of that particular day that you won't find yourself waiting.  Parking is a b!tch. It's a near nightmare getting in and out of the mall parking lot that this location is a part of.

The service: Lackluster. I won't name names but our waiter was absent for the most part. I know it was busy but he seemed to only have a handful of tables in our area. Maybe he had other tables on the other part of the restaurant but he seemed to have a good knowledge of the ACC games that were going on at the time. Just sayin'. Drink refills were few and far between. Getting the check and even a pen to sign the damned thing was too lengthy. This isn't the first time we've had so-so service at this location, either.

The price: Too expensive for what you get. Prices have gone up on anything and everything at RL. We make a trip to them maybe twice a year at the most.

It's hard to give this place the rating I gave. The taste of the food justifies the higher part of the rating but the service and costs are more like a ""2""

Your pal,
Walter"
"NC","Great food and service. Very happy with my visit."
"NC","Lunch today!!  Wood fired shrimp shewers. wild rich pilaf and brocolli.  Wonderful and Service was friendly and attentive!!  Will difinitely be back!! cheese biscuits appetizers were good too!  Got busy while we were there, Restaurant was clean."
"NC","Now I love red lobster but this particular location pissssssed me off!!! It was packed as usual so the food took extra long. the waitress screwed up my bill at the end of the meal, when they seated us it looked like the booth had not been properly cleaned, and the bathroom was just the nastiest bathroom in America. Like i said i understand it was busy but that is no excuse for how gross the bathroom was. i almost threw up from the smell and you could just tell that it probably had not been cleaned all day. I believe when you are an establishment with meals over $10 your bathroom should be spotless. This is something you would expect from burger king or somewhere, not red lobster. I know red lobster is not a 5 star restaurant but come on."
"NC","Always very helpful in this location.  The employees really seem to care about helping customers.  Store is always clean and well stocked.  Today we picked out a 16"" bike for my youngest.  Time to get home and ride!"
"NC","I've got to jump on the bandwagon, here.  This store has been here for a long time and really needs a refreshment.  The outside is old and dilapidated and could stand a new coat of paint.  The inside serves it's purpose but the shopping carts are rusty and old school.  There also never seems to be enough staff around at checkout.

Other than that, they have toys and that's what you're there for."
"NC","I have been in this place several times and have had mixed experience. The service here is not so great. I had a question about a video game for my nephew and I felt like I was putting the clerk off by asking questions. The store was a bit disorganized, but I would expect that for a Saturday afternoon."
"NC","LOL!  I love how everybody refers to this location's creepy feel.  It does seem to bring the ol', ""One two, Freddy's coming for you, three four, you better lock your door"" thing to mind.

Sure the place is a bit dated and dillapidated, but it gets the job done.  The selection is plentiful and fairly priced.  The prices are going to be a bit more than places that aren't specifically ""toy stores,"" but you came to a toy store for a larger selection of toys...didn't you?  The customer service has always been a bit hit or miss here.  Sometimes the workers are hanging out like extras on a movie set...and at other times...they're stalking you like a bum in a liquor store.

Toys R Us usually gets my patronage around Christmas time.  It serves its purpose and I don't really have any complaints about it."
"NC","The parking lot is dark and scary.  There were rusty carts strewn about.  Boxes and toys were all over the floor in the store.  I went twice in the past week and they had one register open with four other people doing nothing both times.  First cashier wasn't friendly but the most recent one was.  The prices were okay.  I had a Groupon for the first visit and 15% off for the second.  The store needs a major overhaul and some employees who care."
"NC","This is a solid location for Toys R Us, but the building itself does appear to be on the downside of it's useful life. It might even be living on borrowed time. A good power washing could help, or it could start poking holes in the walls and then they would just have to tear it down.

If this location were in South Park, it probably would have been razed already since it is a bit of an eyesore. Then again, if it were in South Park, it would probably carry some sort of overpriced baubles rather than the row after row of only slightly expensive toys that we all know and love. Enjoy it for what it is."
"NC","Great customer service. 
Convenient location. 
Large assortment of games which is appreciated but the prices are a bit high.
Minus the prices, I dig it."
"NC","I got a stroller from here for my daughter that was delivered from Atlanta, GA and not a thing was wrong with it. I didn't have any problems, I just gave them my name and they got it from the back. They are very friendly, and helpful. 
I also got Christmas gifts for my daughter and others on a separate occasion with no problems, everything they advertised was there, and the correct price. I got in and out. Didn't spend over a penny more than my planed budget. I was so excited. lolol."
"NC","Took my mom to lunch yesterday and I felt like soup, we both got the managers special which is a cup of soup, half a sandwich & your choice of regular or baked chips. 

The spicy seafood gumbo was great. Loaded with a lot of shrimp. Mom & I both got that. I had the half chicken panini, which was perfect. Mom had the Ruben and loved it. The chips were baked for both. 

You can never go wrong with Jason's Deli."
"NC","Definitely not stingy on the meat! The hot corned beef and the baked potatoes are delicious ."
"NC","This is one of the most accommodating places I have ever had the pleasure of dining.  The staff is fantastic... I come with my two dogs and sit outside on the patio and everyone is always checking on us, offering water right when I get there for my babies and the food is so fresh and delicious."
"NC","5 star for the California club: I got the California club, and it was yummy! I especially like the mayo on the side, it's sweet and it balances the whole sandwich.

0 star if I could for the chicken noodle soup : wayyyyyu too salty, I added half a cup of water in there, still too salty. Only took a few sips of the soup and just can't eat it at all! Lesson learnt....."
"NC","Excellent menu.  Food was good portions and very good.  Reasonable pricing for what you get.  There are a number of outside tables where you can eat with your dogs."
"NC","Good food fast service for the size crowd. got to teach my daughter how to swirl a soft serve."
"NC","The restaurant was clean and the people working were friendly.  But, the food was just okay the corn beef was sliced too thick and it was tough."
"NC","The Pineville store is MY Jason's. Service is always great. Several employees greeted me when I came in and they were busy too. I always feel welcome. I do love the instant salad bar line where you can jump the big line and order a salad (plus soup and proteins) on a card-only kiosk. I NEVER wait which is one of the reasons I go to Jason's. The other main reason I go to Jason's is the salad bar. It's always fresh and has some nice extras. The only negatives are that frequently the lettuce is wetter than I like and they put ice down in some of the vegetables which ends up in my salad. Also I miss the cauliflower!
Minor details. They do a good job at Jason's Pineville."
"NC","The staff at Jason's Deli is, quite simply, outstanding.  I wouldn't hesitate to call them the most friendly, attentive and courteous restaurant staff ever.  They have really set themselves apart from other establishments in their cheerful level of service.  The food is also superb.  I recommend the Zucchini Grillini sandwich, which is as fun to eat as it is to say.  It is layers of zucchini with tomatoes, red onions, black olives and Russian dressing which is the perfect blend of complements on this sandwich.  Enjoy it with the blue corn tortilla chips or a side of fresh fruit.  Don't forget the ice cream machine for your free ice cream afterward.  They have recently redecorated the dining room to give it a more coffeehouse-style feel and it is nice."
"NC","Was privy to eat lunch here several times this week.  The pastrami sandwich is a golden throwback to NYC deli pastrami sandwiches,  complete with some spicy brown mustard....  And the ice cream wins you over also..."
"NC","I took my order to go from Jason's deli and it was a quick non painful experience. I did see a worker named Jason go out of his way to help a family who spilled their drink on the table. It was nice to see someone caring about other people. I still think this place is over priced so I gave it 3 instead of 4 stars. The New York Yankee is pretty damn good."
"NC","I got to my hotel a little after 10pm and, not wanting to order pizza, I yelped for a nearby restaurant and Jason's Deli came up. Knowing how delicious their food is, I gave them a call and the manager Tim said they had closed at 10 but since I was close he told me he'd reopen for me. Not only did he not rush me, he made recommendations and even threw in a couple extras. It was a great way to start my trip so if you're in Pineville, NC, go to Jason's Deli and ask for Tim. Incredibly nice guy and what great service!"
"NC","What a wonderful experience!  I am so impressed by this place and I'm mad at myself it took me this long to come.  They have a very large selection of sandwiches and a large salad bar.  My favorite part is getting the half sandwich (any on the menu) and half salad (which is large enough to put your head in).  There are complimentary muffins on the dessert bar and free ice cream too.  Everything is fresh and/or organic.  I'll go any chance I'm over this way."
"NC","Stopped by Jason's Deli Saturday while on vacation in South Carolina last weekend. This was a perfect lunch spot that could satisfy a lot of different appetites. A number of the menu items sounded SO good but I decided to go with the salad bar so I could try a little of everything there. 

The salad bar was clean and had lots of goodies to choose from. Loved the couscous salad they had there. You can definitely fill up on just the salad bar alone and for a good price. 

The restaurant was busy but were able to order right away and the two ladies I was with received their food quickly. As soon as we were finished a nice guy was ready to clear our plates. 

Looking forward to my next trip to SC to check out this place again!"
"NC","Well done Jason's Deli, well done! 

Stopped in for lunch today, and it actually was busy inside but not overwhelming! I was able to order right away and decided to attempt to get a ""healthy"" lunch so I ordered the Ranchero Chicken Wrap to go...it comes with in an organic wheat wrap and blue chips and salsa...so in my book that's healthy enough for me! 

BUT...what made the trip so awesome was that while I was waiting for them to prepare my wrap the manager came out from behind the counter and said it wouldn't be a long  but to help myself to an ice cream cone while I waited....can you say WINNING!!! 

But now on to the wrap...

When I first unwrapped it, I wasn't very impressed with how it looked but once I tasted it all those thoughts were pushed aside. The wrap comes in a wheat wrap with grilled chicken breast, cheddar cheese ,jalapeños, pico de gallo, some southwest spices and ranch dressing. The  jalapeños added a nice little kick, but they weren't overpowering. I couldn't really taste the southwest spices perhaps they were overpowered by the ranch dressing but unlike most people I'm a fan of ranch dressing ( I know it's a lot of calories but its so delicious I digress) 

The blue chips were good but the salsa was delicious! It tasted VERY fresh. It was so good, I added some of the my wrap....YUMMY!

Overall, I was very impressed....enjoyed my lunch and the ice cream cone....will I be back....of course!"
"NC","They know they were wrong for moving in next to Subway. 
I went over there because i glimpsed the subway sign & decided to go to Jason's instead. I can't be the only person to do this.

Service was great & I enjoy the foursquare special. Good stuff."
"NC","I am a fan of Jason's and a definite regular. I love, love the salad bar. My only complaint - please don't put ice in the salad bar ingredients. I know you want to keep it fresh but sorting out the cauliflower from the ice is a pain and I ultimately end up with a pool of water in my bowl."
"NC","Grub wise, Jason's deli is pretty affordable and the food is decent. No complaints there. The to-go process makes me want to bang my head against a wall tho. About once a month everyone at work decides ""lets have Jason's  for lunch"". I am the person who gets to make this happen. 
First time i saw they offered delivery ""Sweet, right?"" Um no, Its like $8 extra for delivery. Which they don't tell you over the phone. Not cool. On this occasion the money collection at work wasn't adding up so i had to call for itemized sammich prices and only then was i told about the delivery charge. They did wave it since they had neglected to mention it but $8 to deliver 1 mile, no thank you, not doing that again.
So now i call everything in and pick it up myself...not once out of roughly 20 orders has everything actually been correct. Dressings for salads have been left out, menu items missing and sometimes haven't even made it on to the ticket...requests for extra pickles ignored. It's an uphill battle with this place. So, its not to be obnoxious but i have to take everything out before i leave and verify all the food is there. Ive been conditioned. My advice is anyone picking up a to-go order is to do the same.
Like i said, the food is actually pretty good but honestly i don't think grabbing a few sandwiches and salads need to be so difficult."
"NC","This is a place everyone in my family likes. My husband loves the penne pasta while my daughter and I get their salad bar. Their baked potato is also very good."
"NC","The food is excellent.  The service is average and the place is over priced.  BUT THE FOOD IS GGGGGGGRRRRREEEEEEEAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTT"
"NC","I had never been to a Jason's Deli before.  As I entered there is a large sign pointing where one should place a take out order, but no additional signage showing where those that are dining in should go.  After I figured it out and grabbed a menu, I ordered the penne pasta with meatballs.
The meal was brought out in a timely manner and to my pleasant surprise served on a real plate with real utensils, not disposable stuff.
This was an ample portion of pasta and meatballs.  Good taste and reasonably priced."
"NC","Overall, I really like Jason's Deli, despite some negatives.  The main reason I like it is that they offer a slew of natural and even a few organic items.  Other reasons I like it is the salad bar with organic mixed greens and the array of toppings you can choose.  It's also a clean establishment, and the service is very quick.  You also get free soft serve ice cream for dessert if you choose to indulge a little bit.  The salad bar also has complimentary mini muffins which are quite tasty.  

The main negative is the price.  While the salad bar is fairly priced at about $8, you will have to pay extra if you want proteins such as grilled chicken or chicken salad.  They at least have some hard-boiled eggs included in the bar if you want those for protein, as well as some cheese.So if you want a salad with chicken as well as a drink, you're looking at about $11-12, more than you would pay at Ruby Tuesday's for a similar thing, and in a less enjoyable environment.  Another negative, at least to me, is that this place is overrun by south Charlotte kids who have control over their parents.  We witnessed one child smack her mother and neither parent did anything about it.  That was just one of the seemingly 1000 children running freely throughout the place and screaming.  It seriously felt like Chuck E. Cheese.    Another negative, as someone else mentioned, is that there is probably just too much on the menu.  As such, their is no menu board.  People have to take a menu from the counter and then order which causes confusion.

I probably won't go running back to Jason's Deli based mainly on the price, but if it's dinner time and I do, I will likely get my food to go.  I will say that the employees and management were very nice."
"NC","I like Jason's Deli. They have pretty chipper employees, a clean establishment, a nice array of soups, sandwiches and salads and free ice cream and muffins. Really, what's not to like? 

I try to eat healthy-ish 80-90% of the time, so I was perusing the menu looking for a tasty wrap or sandwich. The Ranchero wrap stood out in all its spicy glory: Organic wheat wrap with natural, grilled chicken breast, cheddar, jalapeños, pico de gallo, Southwest spices, ranch dressing. Served with organic blue corn tortilla chips and salsa for $6.99. 

Was this wrap tasty? Yes. Should I have, perhaps, asked for the ranch on the side? Yes...because thanks to Jason's very well put together website and easily accessible nutrition information, this wrap bombed me with 680 calories, 28 grams of fat and more than 2,000 grams of sodium. Damn Gina. 

Now, I'm not blaming this establishment for serving highly caloric items...it happens. I like Jason's. I just have to be a bit more careful of what I order!"
"NC","Huge disappointment.

I wanted a real deli sandwich (not Subway).  I thought I'd give this place a try.  $10.00 got me a 6"" meatball sub on a white bun, Lay's potato chips, and a pickle spear, with a regular soda.  The sub was not one bit better than Subway.  This was a complete waste of my time and money.  I could have had the same exact thing (sans the pickle), and chosen my own chips from a variety.  
They have a lot of food on the menu; I have no idea how the soups, salads, etc. are.  All I know is that I couldn't even find a list of the types of bread they offer on the menu.  This place is hard to navigate, and the food quality is not worth the trouble.

UPDATE:  Went back for lunch (at a friend's request) on Tuesday (11/1).  I had the chicken club salad and a cup of the Southwestern Chicken Chili.  Both were quite good.  My bill:  $14.90.  I'll up the rating to 2 stars, as the food is OK (not great), but it is WAY overpriced."
"NC","I zoom. I zoom, I walk fast, I multitask - every movement I make is planned for efficiency. Therefore, Jason's Deli is my lunch spot of choice and here is why. I can just walk up to the salad bar kiosk, touch the screen a few times, slide my card and walk two steps to where a smiling person hands me my plate and cup. Quick. I have waited in line maybe one time even when the sandwich line is out the door. 
Jason's salad bar is the best I have found. The ingredients are always fresh and the selection is good. Yes I am a fan of Jason's in Pineville."
"NC","Jason's Deli on Centrum Parkway is always busy at lunch.  I have always eaten at their salad bar, which is actually quite tiny.  For a salad buffet, Souper Salad offers significantly more salad toppings and additional buffet options at a similar price.  I feel like I never get my money's worth at Jason's, though the salads there are tasty and nutritious."
"NC","Not too crazy about this place. I ordered a pastrami on rye and it was just a pile of meat on soggy bread."
"NC","Can't go wrong with their soup and salad bar. You don't even have to wait in line with their do-it-yourself ordering."
"NC","Jason's Deli is the jam when it comes to fresh sandwiches overflowing meat and toppings.  I'm always blown away by the selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and bread and the combinations that the cheerful staff point clueless folks to.  .

VEGETARIANS BEWARE: YOU WILL BE APPALLED BY WHAT I WILL SAY NEXT.  Like Todd W. says, the roast beef sandwich is awesome.  I've had it twice and I can honestly say its the best roast beef sammie I can recall.  It's not like that grey matter they serve at Arby's.  No, its pink at the core, moist and pilled 1-inch thick on bread.  The sides are equally appealing, like the homemade-tasting potato salad.The portions alone make this place stand out-think McAllister's on steroids

The salad bar looked incredibly fresh as well.  In fact, the whole establishment looks fresh.  Yes, you get free muffins and ice cream.  But don't let them spoil your appetite-their sandwiches alone will bust your gut.  For around $8, you will leave Jason's Deli fat and happy."
"NC","Hadn't been to a Jason's Deli in a while, but went today for lunch as I had an errand to run near by, and I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe it was the girl at the counter who was so helpful, but in the handful of times I've been to Jason's Deli, I never had anyone tell me about the complimentary ice cream and muffins. Your choice - before or after you eat, no matter. Most people were eating while they waiting for their food to be delivered. I was in awe...ha. The roast beef sandwich was great and the portion was large...couldn't finish it all. If you're in the mood for something fast and lite, make sure to check out the self serve and self pay salad bar...and yes, the ice cream will be there for you too."
"NC","Great deli with TONS of seating.  They have a salad bar option, but no matter what you get cornbread and garlic toast and ice cream for free.  It's a quick order, and they bring the food out to you.  The muffalettas are HUUUUGE.  The sandwiches are awesome and so are the actual salads (never tried the salad bar option yet).  I've gotten the nutty salad, and the salmon caesar.  All top notch.  This is definitely a quick get in and out and good food to boot whether it's lunch or dinner."
"NC","Great sandwiches and you get free ice cream at the end.  What's not to love?"
"NC","Cheap & Cheerful. 
Jason's Deli is quick and easy. Order and pay when you walk in and they bring the food to your table. Lots of food choices and of course good deli food.
The best part about Jason's Deli is the flaw in service. None of the staff notice all the freeloading. Now I have never freeloaded, from here. But everyone just goes up and dips from the salad bar, taking all the cake they could possibly desire. Why would you pay for a fountain drink when the cups are right next to the machine? My little brother especially loves Jason's Deli because of all the candy laying out and specialty soft drinks in glass bottles. I can't tell you how many times we have had to empty his pockets and send him back or make him pay for the drink he has casually walked off with. 
Despite all the looting happening right before your eyes Jason's Deli is basic restaurant where you can't go wrong."
"NC","HUGE menu. Lots of sandwiches, salad, wrap, etc. options. Desserts. Variety of drinks. Spuds! Healthy or non-healthy, they've got 'em all! I absolutely love this place! You can go for weeks and try something different everyday. Also because you can create your own sandwich or wrap too. Their spuds are pretty big and tasty. I only wish they had more than 4 spud options. Double-thumbs up."
"NC","Ok, this place, unfortunately, I have to frequent every 3,0000 miles for an oil change, thanks to the wonderful dealership I purchased my car through! I will try to make this short, sweet, and to the point! First off, Rey, yes with an ""E"", is the best employee, and most competent employee that they have. He has great customer service skills and he actually greets customers as they come in. Like they are supposed to. 

Anyway, long story short. The last time I came, no problems, with the exception of them being so dern slow. If I have an appointment, I shouldn't have to wait an hr and a half for an oil change.

This time, they were still slow, although they did have a lot of people. I also had an appointment!

The problem is...the oil change message still comes on. Doesn't that mean they didn't do the oil change? 

When they did it last time, that message went away. I also noticed that, the reminder sticker that they put on my windshield, for the next oil change was never changed, and they wrote the wrong mileage on it as well. Not pleased..."
"NC","The entrance is hard to find/identify... the exit says Sears, but the entrance has a door that says Avis/Budget.  You have to wait in line to bring your car in for service instead of parking in the lot and going into the shop with your keys.  Waiting in line took roughly 20 minutes on a Tuesday about 12 noon.  

I brought my car in for a simple oil change.. it took almost 3 hours.  Granted when they told me it was done, there were several things that Diego had found that I could fix in my car.. the list of repairs totaled over $800.  I didn't bring the car in for an inspection, just an oil change.. that's all I wanted.. could have saved time elsewhere.  It was about $40 for a high mileage oil change including tax and with a discount coupon.

They assured me that the fluids (windshield washer, power steering, etc.) would be topped off; I checked in the parking lot afterwards and it was not done.  I was so fed-up with waiting so long that I didn't feel the need to wait even more."
"NC","3.5 Star Rating....rounded up to 4 (I feel generous today) As far as Sears auto stores go this is a pretty good one. They're always busy being in a mall....but to me that's its appeal. You can drop off your car and eat, shop, people watch, whatever and kill some time while having at least some fun. 

The service here is pretty good and prices average. They have worked on 3 cars of mine and have usually done a decent job. Quite frankly I do prefer Pep Boys but you're stuck there with nothing to do. So I keep coming to this Sears for those things that take time so I can walk the mall."
"NC","associates very helpful and willing to help you find what you need."
"NC","Went here to get 4 tires and they were extremely quick! Within one hour, they quoted me (a great price) and had the tires installed. Was surprised that they came in lower than other competitors, so definitely check them out."
"NC","I have visited many Sears Auto Centers in time of need.  On this cold day, I dropped off my vehicle to have the tires balanced and rotated.  The tires were purchased at another location which qualify for free rotations.  Service was prompt and thorough though I had to wait about one and a half hours for the service to be completed.  After exhausting ourselves in the mall (physicaly and monetarily), I made my way back to Sears.  Service on my vehice had been completed, but no one called me.  No problem though.  I engaged a staff member, paid for the extra service, and was happily on my way.

Reservations are not accepted.  Make plans to keep busy either in the mall or in the waiting room (I prefer the former)."
"NC","Terrible treatment.  If you have an emergency do NOT come here.  They have the worst unprofessional staff that is completely unorganized, no sense of urgency, and spend most of their time eating and chatting in the hall.  You will waste 3 hours in the ER bleeding from a head injury and concussion as others keep gerring treatment.  One nurse said ""oh we keep forgetting about you""  WTF!   Go here to die!"
"NC","My daughter was 7 months old and she has severe eczema she's been screaming and crying for hours and scratching her herself nonstop it's a bloody mess. One of the nurse was being kinda rude because I overheard the word morphine I called my husband to make sure that they are not giving my baby morphine. He asked to speak to the doctor I asked the nurse if she could speak to him she basically just brush me off saying ""I don't have time to talk to him "" they got an IV on her and were about to give her doses of Benadryl,Antibiotic and Morphine !!! Both me and my husband strongly disagree because she's a little baby and just because she is screaming her lungs out and has severe skin flares ups does not mean she needs morphine!!!! We were transfer to Levine and the doctor there was also shocked when we told him they were gonna give her morphine."
"NC","I went to the ER at CMC Pineville in early January due to intense abdominal and back pain, for which I was diagnosed as having shingles. Although the waiting time in the room was over two hours, the PA assisting me was very courteous and thorough, and I was discharged after four hours (early morning hours). The admitting process was very easy and the instructions they gave to me (as well as a referral to an excellent physician) were easy to understand and very comprehensive, explaining exactly what it was that I had and how to care for it. A week later, they called me to check on my progress and to make sure that I was all right. I've been to several medical centers and ER's in my life but this was the first time one had ever bothered to do a follow-up call. I would definitely go back to CMC Pineville for any emergency medical issue."
"NC","(8/12/13) It is amazingly difficult to get this hospital to arrange a payment plan to pay a bill. After going nowhere with an automated phone menu and then when reaching a live person, I was told that they do not handle Pineville at that location. So here I am at CMC Pineville waiting for a patient registration representative. I'm pretty sure that it won't be a pleasant experience.

And... drum roll please... I was wrong. I met with a very nice representative named Gladys. She was able to get me enrolled in a program called Access One that lets me pay my bill over a year interest free. We spent about an hour together talking but if you are in a hurry it would probably have taken less time. It was very refreshing to be able to experience great customer service."
"NC","(6/24/2013) Well its time for my 3 year check up to see what the state of my pituitary tumor is. For some unfathomable reason CMC-Pineville wanted me to show up an hour early at the main entrance. There is actually plenty of surface parking this early in the morning so that's a plus. The main waiting area is also empty.

The MRI waiting room features the wide chairs. Some of the chairs have circular tables offset on their left arms.  The room is painted in muted blue and olive green. There is a 47"" LG tv hung in the middle of the wall containing the check in window. There is also an alcove with a coffee maker & bottled water.

I had been sitting behind a column & for some odd reason the tech didn't look into the entire room. I had to move nearer to the door and wait for her to come out again. The MRI is a GE model installed in 2006. Most MRI machines have their own noises that can actually be melodic. This machine actually made my body vibrate. It was strange.

So far it was a five star experience but it was soon time to inject me with the radioactive contrast material. Things started going downhill after the MRI tech & another tech attempted to inject me with the material & instead collapsed my veins in both my arms. They next wanted to try my hands and I refused. I told them to butterfly it into a vein on a forearm. Their response was to stick the needle into my left wrist. The contrast was then pushed into the vein burning its way along. I will never have another MRI done there. Perhaps they knew that they wouldn't be getting excellent reviews of their service as I have not received any surveys to complete."
"NC","I went to the Vein Center for a hair removal treatment. I was greeted on time. The procedure took 10 mins - in and out. Clean, nice staff. Beware though if you are more than 5 minutes late, they will turn you away."
"NC","Never thought I'd be writing about a hospital.  My experience started at the ER. Every staff member was friendly and made it a point to ask about me.  I actually moved through this portion of my stay smoothly, except, and I get this, waiting for 3 hours for those who are brought in by ambulance taking precedence, to see a physician.
I had a smooth transition for admittance and was treated very nicely by the observation room staffing.  Ordered tests were administered in a timely fashion.  As always, food quality is a point overlooked by institutions, but my meals were adequate. The restaurant has a pretty good offering and there is a Caribou Coffee for your fix!
This facility is newer than Uptown offerings and since we live close it has become our hospital of choice but hopefully not any time soon again!"
"NC","So here we are once again CMC, Pineville. (3/8/13) I got home and my wife was doubled over on the living room floor. Our dogs were bouncing around her barking. She said that she thought she had a kidney stone so we drove over to CMC.
The wait wasn't that long at least compared to other waits there in the past. She'd already had her ct scan by the time I'd returned from Caribou Coffee downstairs.  Apparently the cafeteria closes at 7pm. She is now in a room freezing although its at least 75*. We saw the usual parade of people & she was released at 10pm. When we left they had about 75 people in the waiting area."
"NC","i've used only the LAB here and its always quick and polite. My son i disabled and is a extremely hard stick. once she found a usuable vein he hardly even flinched when she stuck him.

since i live 20 miles south of Charlotte this is more convenient than driving all the way into Charlotte."
"NC","It seems like every time we come to this hospital recently our satisfaction drops. This time my wife had a gall bladder attack. We waited for approximately 15 minutes in the waiting room before my wife was taken back into the main ER waiting room. 

Apparently they need more beds and have split a conventional room into a double. They have a satisfaction index on one of the walls before the main nurses station in the ER where a thermometer indicates that patient satisfaction is approximately 50%. Pretty sad. Well my wife had an ultrasound and they determined that her gall bladder needed to be removed. She was admitted and the organ will be removed tomorrow.

Everyone has been great so far. We've always been impressed by the quality of the nursing staff. Today there was a very short wait in the ER. We spent about three hours in the ER itself waiting for a bed to open up in the tower. I had to run some errands but when I came back my wife was surrounded by her nurse Rebekah & a parade of folks came by to run various tests on her.

Well the rest of the CMC Pineville experience mimiced the ER experience. The ER doctor wanted to remove her gall bladder so she was given a private room on the 5th floor of the new medical tower. There are plenty of windows that let you see over to Carrowinds & the skyscrapers downtown.

My wife's surgery took about 2 hours & she had 2 days of recovery in her room before I picked her up late Saturday morning. I can't say that the hospital's food is really any good. I definitely know that what the patients are given is marginal at best. However the cafeteria & the little Caribou Coffee Shop really aren't any better. I had a chance to eat at both & wasn't impressed.

I did think it was odd that her surgeon never came out to talk to me after the procedure."
"NC","I've been going to this hospital long before it became part of the CMC system. The staff is great especially the nurses, but the amount of time that you have to wait to see a doctor in the emergency room is ridiculous. Tonight my wife drove me over because I was in a great deal of pain from a kidney stone. We arrived about 10pm. I was checked in & after waiting about half an hour I had my vitals checked. I was then shown into a smaller waiting room where I sat till 1am when I told the nurse I was leaving. I was told that I was third in line for a room. I replied that equated to showing up at Firebird's at 7pm on a Saturday night and waiting for a table. The nurse agreed that I would probably be waiting another couple hours. That was unacceptable. They told me that they would give me a note for my boss if I would stay for however long it took. Seeing as I'm self employed that was no incentive and I told them so. They then wanted to pump a bag of saline into me and make me talk to a doctor. Fortunately I had the CT scan in the first hour of waiting. It was definitely the fastest way to have a CT scan without waiting. That was the only positive to the evening's misadventure. Well to be fair the nurse that started my IV line, Cynthia did an excellent job as well. The rest of the time that I spent there showed me that the ER needs a serious refresher course in triage."
"NC","I have been to CMC-Pineville twice with my daughter and also a couple of times to accompany others who needed to visit the ER.

On my first visit, my daughter had sprained her wrist and we went to the ER for an x-ray to make sure the bone was not actually broken.  We were pretty fortunate because we did not have a long wait and all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.

Our second visit was for my daughter to have her wisdom teeth removed.  Her oral surgeon arranged everything and gave us all the pre-surgical instructions,  so we just showed up at the appointed time, we filled out the necessary insurance papers and did not have much of a wait before the procedure. Thankfully, the surgery went without a hitch so no overnight visit was necessary. 

The other times I have visited the ER was with a family member and a neighbor -both of which thought they were having a heart attack.  The ER staff certainly does not mess around when someone presents with cardiac symptoms. They took the patients back right away.  On each of these visits, the staff was very friendly and helpful and let me go back to check on the patients. 

The hospital has been clean and not too crowded on my visits here. Based on my experiences, this is well-run hospital that offers a good level of care.  I think it is nice to have the option to go to this full service hospital close to home... for me, I see no need to drive all the way down to the center of town for the ""main"" hospital."
"NC","Ok, how do you review a place, as your daughter is in pain, it's been 2 hours now and you are stuck in the waiting room, yelping the time away just hoping that she will be next ,and you are still yelping hours later.

I can't quite bring myself to terms as to why it takes so long in an emergency room......I watch ER it doesn't take this long.  

So in my delusional state I am in right now, I just look at all the people around, look at the pace of the staff and there is just no EMERGENCY.  Why can't we just change the name EMERGENCY room to the hey let's get a bunch of people together in pain misery and sickness, and call it a circus.  I mean really, this is ridiculous.

I will provide a time frame for this ADVENTURE.

Current Time of yelping: 6:20pm. 
Waiting..........Started yelping.......

Current Time of yelping: 8:28pm. 
Waiting....... Took picture of Levine's Children's Room.

Current Time of yelping: 8:35pm.

Current Time of yelping: 8:35pm. 
Waiting..........

Current Time of yelping: 9:03pm. 
Waiting.......... They just called our name......Woo Hooo.

Current Time of yelping: 9:23pm. 
Waiting.......... Just got word the doctor still has not come into the room yet...........It's just like Disney, you leave one big room, round the corner and then, yes, another room with more waiting.......so I am still waiting.

Current Time of yelping: 9 37pm. 
Waiting.......... Dr came in......still waiting.

Still here at 11:36pm.......waiting.....

My god the sun will be coming up soon!

Please anybody, is there a DOCTOR in the house.....

OK now its 12:15AM and we are headed out the door.

If you are in need of an emergency room....try Presby in Matthews, wait times were half and the folks we met at the pharmacy had a much better outcome than us.

NCFoodGUy"
"NC","There's plenty of gag gifts and oddities.  Spencers is aimed at the junior high kids and college freshmen gearing up for their spring break drunkapalooza at Myrtle Beach.

There's some fun toys, alcohol accessories, posters, hats, shirts, and blah blah blah.

If your kids are young...and they can read...I wouldn't bring them in here."
"NC","I've outgrown Spencer's. I'd been a Spencer's semi regular for about 15 years but I'd not set foot in one since I was maybe 30 or so. I went in the other day and realized that it's the same exact shit (maybe a little more sex toys and lingerie than I remember) that I once thought to be the cutting edge of individuality and rebellion... yes, without realizing the freakin' irony!

If you're 25 or under you might like the pop culture roundhouse kick to the face you'll receive the second you walk in. Retro-cool, Ironic-cool, Kid-cool, Jap-cool, big-ass gauges, intricate (yet cheap) gothic/punk jewerly, black lights, stonerwear (oh, if only Marley were alive to see what we've done with his image/ideals), strobe lights, outdated Emo shit, Kiss shot glasses, etc is your order of the day.

The employees are mostly kids old enough to have their eyebrows and noses pierces (and ears gauged) but not get any actual tattoos who are, for the most part, actually pleasant and helpful. All in all, it's the same."
"NC","May have already gotten to the age when items in Spencers seem cool to me (which is a big bummer).  I went in here the other day just looking for a clever t-shirt and what I found was a bit shocking.  Yes, maybe cool and funny to a, say, 13 year old... but I was borderline offended by some of the stuff.

To each his/her own I guess.  If I ever need black-lights/strobes or a good ""gag"" gift, this is definitely the place to go.

I don't know if it was just me, but their little ""sex"" corner has gown into a couple of aisles since I remember from my high school days.  Not that I'm a prude or anything like that (well, maybe not by choice ;) )  but you gotta have some major cajones to wear some of the t-shirts that scream, ""look at me and question my intelligence level please!"""
"NC","Meh. It's a Home Depot that is no better and no worse than any other Home Depot I've been into. I was looking for one specific item in the plumbing department and their selection was only one and it didn't have the features I wanted. Oh well, there's always Amazon."
"NC","I live in an apartment and I am not exactly what would be considered handy.  And as I have had to decrease my insurance coverage to the bare minimum thanks to rate hikes over the past 2 years, I try to avoid anything with sharp pointed objects rocket-launched into other things.  

I am moving and need boxes and packaging material and such.  As my firm designs Home Depots, I try to stay loyal to the brand (job security!).  I found myself on the Pineville side of town after lunch and figured as this store is a little harder to get to (across 51 from Carolina Place mall and very near to where 485 cruises through Pineville) it might be a little less crowded.  

Upon walking into the clean store, I was greeted by a smiling employee and asked where I could find moving supplies.  He directed me to an aisle number and said walk all the way to the back of the store.  Behold!  Moving stuff.  They had quite a few large, medium and small boxes, packing tape, bubble wrap in several different sizes/lengths, tape guns, etc.  Perfect, just what I needed.  While looking at the boxes, I had two gentlemen asked if I needed assistance getting the boxes into the cart and one shopper tell me that she would be praying for me, as moving sucks (amen, lady... amen).  

They only had one checkout line open (approx. 1 pm on a winter Sunday), but all 4 self-check lines were humming along.  As I had large awkward boxes that I was balancing in the cart, along with a large roll of bubble wrap and some rolls of packing paper, I elected to go through the regular checkout so I wouldn't be the lady that knocked over a row of displays in a crashing domino effect of destruction.  Unfortunately I was behind someone who was stocking up on a cart-full of batteries and light bulbs in preparation for what I assume based on sheer quantity of items would be some sort of zombie apocalypse, so that took an eternity, but whatever... I took that opportunity to check out my facebook and texts.  The woman at the checkout was quite friendly and also passed along her good wishes for my move.  I was asked again if I needed help getting the boxes into my vehicle, but I declined and battled them alone.  

I got what I wanted, at the price I expected, and save for the wait at the checkout, I was in and out in no time with exactly what I needed."
"NC","Hello Friends, 

(Disclaimer) I have been on a serious Planking kick. One of my favorite show (online)  is Sam the Cooking Guy. He made a Cedar Plank Salmon that looked outta this world. Sooooo

In comes Home Depot. Instead of ordering cedar planks online for 10-34.99 or going to Wally world or the like and buying them for around 15 bucks. Under the direction of Sam, I went to a lumber yard. (well not quite but you get the point). 

I walked in and straight to the wood sections. Asked the guy for UNTREATED Cedar Wood. Well he pointed me in the direction of A LOT of different wood. I told him what i was trying to do and he in fact told me to go to Wally World. NO THANKS. 

He pointed me to some Cedar Wood 6ft tall. Well, i picked one up and asked if he could cut thme into 12 inch long ""planks"". He did so and I was outta there...

Total cost for 6feet of Cedar wood cut into 6 twelve inch cuts... = 2.76.
So instead of spending 10-35 bucks on 2 -12 inch planks, I spent 2.76 on 6 -12 inch planks. 

WINNING!!!!
(of course i took pictures)"
"NC","This is a fairly standard Home Depot, with almost nothing to single it out from the others around town, except that they are a bit more challenging to get to than most others, simply because of their location.

Not only is the traffic a bit worse because of the 485/51 intersection, but then you have to take this strange loop around the shopping center and finally you get to Home Depot at the end of the road - the last store on the left, as it were.

Once you get there, everything is just about the same as all the others, and the staff is nice enough, so there are no real surprises to be found. I have had neither bad nor particularly good experiences in this particular location, since we do not get to this side of the city all that often."
"NC","Stopped in here to pick up some stuff for a project.  I was very warmly greeted at the door - even though I was staring at my phone (with the list of what I needed).  All the Home Depot stores are pretty much organized the same way so I was in and out in no time - more time to get home and start projects!

I didn't ask for any help since this was a quick stop, but it looked like there were a lot of employees with smiles on their faces to help if you needed to find anything or needed advice on your current project."
"NC","It was my second time at David's Bridal. First, I went to David's Bridal Northlake Mall and I didn't have a good experience. I liked their dresses online, so I decided to give David's Bridal a second chance. David's Bridal Pineville-completely different experience! My consultant was a really sweet and helpful girl named Dionna. She brought all the dresses I liked online and helped me with everything! I found my wedding gown! Great!"
"NC","I am a fan!

I went in with one of my good friends from high school this past May. My wedding isn't until next year in September, but I at least wanted to try on different styles of dresses to see what looked best on me. The third one I tried on, I actually felt like a bride. I was glowing, and I felt beautiful. I really didn't want to have that bridal moment because it was just so early, I just wanted to try on different styles!!

Surprisingly though, I called my Dad a few days after to ask him if he would escort me down the aisle. And then out of nowhere, he offered to pay for the dress that I loved. I almost started crying. It was so unexpected and it was one of the greatest things anyone has ever done for me.

Of course, my matron of honor and I went back in 10 days later (same consultant: Ella. Love her!) and we bought the dress! Every time I think about it I get so happy. The first visit, I just told Ella to bring me a dress, any dress, that had a certain kind of style. It was supposed to be a test, but I loved it. Thank you Ella!!!

I will definitely go back to shop for my bridesmaid dresses at this location. All of the staff are very nice, friendly, and they KNOW what brides want, and even something that the bride herself would never think of wearing. 

I highly recommend this location for another reason. Men's Wearhouse works alongside David's Bridal. For instance, the dresses for my bridesmaids are gonna be a Canary Yellow. Well, Men's Wearhouse can provide the tuxedos with the exact same color that David's Bridal has. I think that's unbeatable. 

Thank you David's Bridal!"
"NC","I ordered a pair of shoes with a saleslady at this location.  She was super friendly and professional.  When I went pin to pick up the shoes another super friendly staff member was there to help me! I left feeling very happy and excited for my wedding.  I should have gone here and not Northlake to buy my dress! !!"
"NC","This location has awful reviews on Google. Just awful... I was nervous going in but I received better service here than at the one across town by Northlake. David's normally doesn't carry anything in my size but the ladies here heard me out and understood that I had spoken to the bride and had gotten the okay to get a dress other than the one she had registered us for. 

I really appreciate that none of them suggested that I ""eat more"" or buy a dress that is too large and get it cut down - as though either of those are viable options. 

They took really good care of me, I was in & out in about half an hour. This includes trying the dress i wanted in the smallest size they had on hand (2) and having their alterations lady drop what she was doing and come pin me up to confirm that it was indeed too big. 

And I didn't have to fight traffic. Win."
"NC","Wedding dress shopping...BOOM!!!  Done.  Found my perfect dress on the first day of trying.  I felt super lucky.  I was so worried that I was going to be stressed out and overwhelmed with everything.  I wasn't really sure what kind of dress or color would look good on me.

David's Bridal was a good choice for me to stop by.  Upon entering, I was quickly greeted by an employee.  I sat down at the desk and was asked for my information so they could put me in the system, and they quickly assigned me to a consultant, even though it was a random stop by and I had no appointment.  I really appreciated all the help.  I waited only five minutes for them to find me a consultant, and I was teamed up with Ashley.  She was such a sweetheart!!!  When I was looking through the dresses without her first, I just had no idea where to start.  Ashley was nice and helped me start out by finding what type of style I would like to look for so that she could help narrow down what I would actually like.  It was such a good suggestion!  She's such a great employee!  Great customer service here.  I never felt pressure of having to buy one of their dresses, only to find out what I would like to see on me, and the staff also suggested what I should look for when I browsed at other stores  (which I won't now since I'm perfectly happy with my dress).

The store's atmosphere is great.  The dressing room walls are all lined with mirrors, so that was great!  I could see my dress from all angles.  Very important to see all the details of a wedding dress.  What I also thought was great was the store's ritual of when you have picked out your dress.  They made me ring a bell when I finally decided I had found my perfect dress.  Note, I also had to close my eyes and make a wish before ringing the bell as hard as I could.  It was so cute!

I would recommend future brides to come to this store.  It was just perfect!  And they also have some good deals.  The staff was nice and told me that there are deals often, so I could check in from time to time.  I know that I'll have to bring my bridesmaids here to look for their outfits.  Can't wait to see the wonderful staff again!"
"NC","First, this is a review from the perspective of buying a formal dress for a special occasion NOT from a bride or bridal party experience.

I wasn't even going to go here as I saw a few terrible Google Reviews of poor customer service for this location.  My daughter needed a formal gown that we were not able to find at Nordstroms, Belk, or Dillards. Our shopping time was on a Monday morning around 11:30am.

We first went to J. Majors Bridal Boutique at 2400 Park Road.  As soon as the Sales clerk learned that we were not a bride or part of a bridal party, we were immediately left alone.  We then headed to NYBride at 4618 South Blvd and pretty much received the same treatment.  Both were rated highly by bride and bridal party so I believe that their Sales Associates were instructed to focus only on those customers as a revenue potential is much higher with that group than someone buying a special occasion dress.

Since our experience with customer service have been pretty atrocious with both stores, I decided that why not go to David's Bridal.  We were pleasantly surprised while we were browsing the very well stocked store when 3 different Sale Associates approached us to offer their help.  Once we found dresses that my daughter wanted to try on, a Sales Associate named Shakira promptly escorted us to the dressing room.  Eventhough she was also helping 2 other customers, I was able to get her attention 4 different times to ask questions and get help from Alteration staff.  I felt that the service that I received was attentive and I would definitely go back here if I ever need a special occasion dress again.

Thank you Shakira for your outstanding service while we were there!"
"NC","I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area. Came back the next day excited to buy the glasses and was told the glasses were not on sale for 50% and that the quote someone gave me the day before was wrong. The new quote was DOUBLE what I was quoted the day before! Not only was I disappointed about the price, but the sale associate was rude and didn't care about what had happened. I will never shop at Lens Crafters ever again. What a horrible experience! I also came in many times before and the employees never helped me. They were just sitting down doing nothing. I honestly don't know how they are able to stay in business if they don't help customers or at least ask."
"NC","Lenscrafters...the standard in ""while you wait"" glasses, almost exclusively located in malls around the country.  My boyfriend had been wearing glasses taped together on the sides for oh, about 9 months now, so I decided to make him an appointment for new specs.  We were in and out in a matter of two hours, counting the wait time for his new glasses to be made.  The staff were knowledgable and friendly, without being pushy or trying to force him into choosing something he didn't like because they are ""trendy"" (it's happened to us before!)  They were also running a special, so we got $100 off the frames and lenses, which really helps when your insurance only covers the exam.  All in all, a great experience.  We will be back when I need contacts! :)"
"NC","I wouldn't even give them one star at this location!! Beware Dr. Jeffrey Musler and Associates optometry group PA!!! This was the worst service and experience I have ever received!!! The ladies at the reception desk are horrible!!!! I called to order contacts and they were utterly confused. Miscommunication across the board. The receptionist said ""maybe"" they'll go ahead and service me and they might call me back and hung up on me! I was simply trying to order contacts as the doctor told me it would be easy as calling in to do so. Terrible place and I would not recommend this facility to anyone."
"NC","Jackie the cashier fantastic!  She helped me choose my shrimp and fish meal which was pretty good.  
But...husband's meal not so good. 1 piece of fish was fishy tasting, and the baked potato tasted like it was baked 4 dozen times. 
Dinning room so stuffy ugh and its 91° outside"
"NC","Excellent food. Idk why everyone's complaining. I begged hubby to take me here for the second time. The good is sooooo yummy. Don't let the other reviews fool you. Trust me I tell it like it is.. Although it's considered fast food it's the best place ever!!"
"NC","Where to begin my review as this will be my 1st and last review for this place.  I will definitely be sending a letter to the corporate office on this place. Upon entering for my families 1st time trying this spot for take out it would be our last.  I was in total shock seeing the cashier handling the register then placing lids on the tartar sauces used for the meals.  At no point was any washing of the hands or using gloves ever attempted, mind you dealing with the register.  As my families meal was brought out, I see a line cook stuffing his face with no gloves on just his bare hands.   I said to myself, this is unsanitary practices being used here.  I then ask another worker to call the managers attention who's behind her and she gets into the ""deer"" mode, acting as if who's the manager. I finally make eye contact with him as he knew I was right and went to the kitchen to possibly tell the guy stuffing his face, you got caught.  The manager was looking all dirty himself too, no name tag, no indication that he's the manager.  I asked for a full refund, I was not spending my money here.  I then ask for his name which he pulls out his a$$ and says it's ""Mr. Rapport"".  Well that's the name I'll use when I compile a letter to the corporate office.  Please beware of this place, save your money for a pack of bologna instead."
"NC","Stopped in for lunch and to my surprise its senior Wednesday...  Lunch 4.99.   It was well attended ny seniors who obviously got the word and didn't just stumble in like me...   Great service from Keshia,...  Had the. 5 shrimp platter which hit the spot....  Only disappointment was they were out of key lime pie.....   Nice spot"
"NC","It was my co-workers choice to pick out our lunch spot and she had a craving for some fried fish and since our options were limited she chose Captain D's!

We walked in and the place was pretty empty. The cashier greeted us and took order right away!  We found a table and waited and waited...finally our food arrived and I realized the wait was for them cooking it up right then! Yesss!!!

I chose the fish tenders and fries combo. I've had it before, but it was much better this time since it was nice and hot!

 I was a little disappointed in two things from my visit, first the fries were cold! If you took the time to make the fish why not the fries??? And they charged me $.10 for a cup of water?!? Really??? 

But I mean overall, I left full and the food was pretty good. So I will be back!"
"NC","Booooo"
"NC","My wife and I came in last week to get ourselves a new mattress.  Our salesman, Antwan, was interested in helping us get the right bed, not the most expensive one.  We ended up purchasing one, had it delivered and put into place the next day.  Been sleeping great since then.  Recommend checking them out when your in the market for a new mattress."
"NC","We purchased Sealy mattress and boxspring from Morgan last week.  He was very polite and helpful.  We had issue with first delivery but he fixed it right away.  Please ask for Morgan for future purchase."
"NC","Bought a mattress & box spring from there and the salesman Proctor Freeman was very helpful. He asked us what we needed and we told him and what our price range was. We bought the mattress. Delivery guys called 30mins before delivery and they were really professional in their taking away our old mattress and replacing it with the new one. They even left us mints for us. I highly recommend this place."
"NC","Be careful when shopping here !  Bought an $8,000+ bed.  Delivered broken !  Are you kidding me - not even inspected prior to delivery.  More interested in sales than checking their product.  Poor attention to detail, poor quality.  When selling expensive products ladies and gentlemen, you need to make sure the product is not broken before delivering - check it in the warehouse - rather simple if you really care. No excuse for discovering a broken product in front of a customer.  Buyer beware with these folks."
"NC","My husband and I ate at Buca di Beppo for lunch today for the first time.  Neither of us were impressed.  The staff was slow and somewhat unresponsive (even though it wasn't busy in the least), the food was subpar and the prices were too high for what we received. 

I would not return!"
"NC","I think this is a great place to go when you have a large number of people but it is expensive. We had chicken parm (very good), fettucine alfredo (very good) and ravioli (good). The waitress was personable but a little too slow to refill glasses, bring wine, etc. 

The room we were in was surprisingly quiet which was nice - we could all hear each other speak! I would go back with a large party - when I save some money!"
"NC","Family style with some coworkers, we had a very affordable dinner for the 3 of us with the small sized portions. Our waitress was attentive and our meal was quite tasty. I wouldnt give them 4 stars as our waitress did forget to bring us our bread and marinara sauce and needed to be reminded but other than that, the atmostphere was clever, the food was yummy and our drinks were decent."
"NC","It's been more than three years since my original review of Buca, so I figured it's time to write again.

Though we still like Buca, and the experience is one that you should really check out if you haven't already, I'm not sure that I'd suggest you do so as heartily as I did before.

For starters, the plates of food seem to have found their way to Dr. Evil's shrinking ray.  It's not uncommon these days for portions to shrink, but for whatever reason - perhaps because Buca already had large prices to begin with - the difference just seems to be much more pronounced.  We still love the shtick, but it's a bit harder to swallow is all.

When it comes to value, it's not there as much as it used to be.  The flavors haven't changed, and they seem to have put a lot of money into a fancy new menu to get you to buy into their plan, rather than the relatively simple menu that they used to have.  The servers even seem to be working on the hard-sell now, rather than the simple family style that used to work so well.  It just isn't the same."
"NC","First visit: We ordered a pizza from the menu on the wall. The ingredients were olives and tomatoes. When pizza came it was covered in onions, and there were a smattering of small chopped olives and tomatoes..it looked like an onion tart. My kids refused...to eat this. We also had to go get our own tea and water, as our waitress forgot, she never refilled...we did that too.

Another visit: my daughter wanted to have her birthday dinner there with some friends. We made reservations months in advance and called day before to confirm. They were confused when we got there....didn't acknowledge we were waiting...and finally took us into the dining room. They tried to sit us at a too small booth that had a huge tear in the seat. NO. We finally got our seat at a table that was actually large enough for all of us...service was spotty. 

on to the food. There is nothing spectacular about anything they serve. It tastes like chef boy rdee, or frozen dinners. Serving family style is nice, but it is akward to go with friends and do this. 

Last visit 4 of us went....3 of us were sick for several days after...2 ended up at emergency room for IV...1 went to doctor for phenegren.....we will not be back after that experience for sure!!!"
"NC","I think this is one of the most fun places to eat in Charlotte, especially if you can snag the kitchen table. It's a kitschy, tacky, wild and funky place, and the food is huge, plentiful, and delicious. The prices aren't bad, either. 

I like the family-style service, although it's easy to over-indulge because everything is so good and so in your face. 

It can get a little busy, so sometimes the servers seem a little overwhelmed. The food can take a while to come out, so although the atmosphere would be great for kids, if your little kidlet is impatient, I would recommend finding somewhere else to go on busy evenings. 

They also offer curbside service if you aren't feeling the atmosphere, so order ahead of time, and they'll bring it out to you."
"NC","If you're looking to grab some good Italian food for dinner, then this place is great. Whether you're going with your family or on a date, it doesn't matter because the atmosphere of this place is unlike any other place you'll go.

Walking in, heck, even the outside of the place, you'll be amazed at the tackiness. Being half Italian, this place brings back a lot of memories of my grandmother's place. It's just so amazingly tacky, from the different types of rooms you can eat in, to the stuff on the walls & ceilings. 

Buca is unique because of how they separate the seating. There are different types of themes for each room & each is very unique. I've sat in the Wine Room twice & filled wine racks cover the entire ceiling. There's also a pope room, with a spinning pope head in the middle of the table...yes...very weird. Also, I believe you have to reserve the booth located in the kitchen, but this is where you can watch the workings of the kitchen from inside of it.

The food here is great as well, with your normal favorites with some other odd creations. They have giant meatballs which are great for more than one person. You can order individual portions, but they're specialty is family style dining. So bring some people with you that have hearty appetites because you get a lot of food here.

This place may be a chain, but it's definitely a must visit if you're an Italian food fan...which I have no idea who isn't. From the uniqueness & tackiness of the place, to the great food you'll get to feed your whole party, you'll enjoy yourself & look forward to coming back soon."
"NC","Though it is a chain, this is one of those places that you just have to visit to appreciate.  It's not your typical chain in that every visit is unique.  The food is served 'family style', so when you see 'small' and 'large', make sure you note that the small serves 2 and the large serves 4.  Also note that those are probably conservative estimates.

The food is excelltent, and the only downside is that the service varies with your server.  Sometimes it is good, sometimes it is bad.  Generally they are friendly but that doesn't always mean that they are good at their job."
"NC","Gave this place another shot after a not so great experience going to their Thanksgiving meal.  I will have to admit, they redeemed themselves.  The food was very good and the quantity was very good.  Myself and another ate, had salad, lasagna and a chicken dish, brought about half of the food home.  The tiramisu for desert was excellent and huge, unable to even finish half of it.  Service was very good and did not feel rushed at all.  

Only complaint is that this place is loud, but that is part of what this place is about, family style and enjoying the company.  

I would go back for the regular menu."
"NC","Food was ok. It wasn't bad, just nothing great. Its like the place tries too hard. They walk you in through the kitchen (cute, but gimmicky). The place is overfilled with photos and artwork. They are nice photos, but its distracting almost on purpose. As if the food is not the real star of the show. It shows in the flavors. The service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu. My server lost me towards the end. He was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him. All in all, it was ok. More focus on food and flavors and less on cliche. Its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal. Nothing to remember"
"NC","Went in for the Thanksgiving Day meal that they offer.  They indicate the two options are for 3 or 6 people.  We had 4 so chose the the meal that feeds 6 to take back leftovers.  Unfortunately they provided for for 4 people, even only brought out 4 pieces of pie for desert.  After getting about one spoon of dressing we asked for extra and were charged for it!  We ordered a bottle of wine when ordering the food that did not arrive until we were half way done eating.  Service wasn't that great either, had to ask for things twice before getting the.

Needless to say, after ordering and paying for a dinner that is supposed to feed 6, we brought nothing home.  It was my parents, uncle and myself, not exactly a group that should go through a Thanksgiving meal that is supposed to feed 6.

This place may be worth the money for the regular menu (never been there for that though) but felt cheated on this TG meal."
"NC","The food here is subpar, at best. When we asked for a kids cheese pizza, they basically smeared some tomato sauce on a tortilla, sprinkled a few strings of shredded cheese on it and, with the way the cheese barely looked melted, I'd estimate they'd popped it in the microwave for maybe 30 seconds. It's a shame the food is so bad though because the decor is fantastic and, getting to take a tour of the kitchen before you eat is something you definitely don't experience everywhere. At least you know that, even if the final dish doesn't taste that great, it came from a clean kitchen."
"NC","Went there on 10/22/14. Service was nice. Server was nice but so ditsy. Ordered bruschetta. Came out fast, but entrée's came out 50 mins later. Ordered eggplant parmigiana. Tasted burned. Waitress took my credit card and we waited almost 10 minutes for our credit card slip and she was so unorganized."
"NC","I can't believe I've never been here before! Went for my birthday last night and everything from the DELICIOUS food to the service was incredible! Our waitress was super nice and helpful, and whoever the tall man was who served the table next to us was extremely patient and helpful with his table. He was super nice seeing how they arrived minutes after closing time. He took his time with them and never acted irritated. Will definitely be back!"
"NC","Booked on Open Table, right after I got the confirming email I called the restaurant and asked if the kitchen table was available. I happen to enjoy sitting in the kitchen. So I was disappointed that my wife and my daughter weren't fans of the experience. But Buca was awesome - they swapped us right out into another table immediately without a wait. Woot!

We chose the large tossed salad to start and then three big entrees to share. Yep, that was probably too much food. Huge platter of Eggplant Parmesan. Big tray of cheese manicotti. Ginormous vat of shrimp fettuccine Alfredo. All really delicious, all really big servings. We took a shedload of it home with us.

As for the desserts, they are ALSO sized to share. The brownie sundae, by itself, is enough for five people. And we also had what we thought was going to be ONE canoli but was actually three of 'em. Oy, my tummy hurts."
"NC","Excellent southern Italian style dishes. Food is served family style so a small portion will feed two people. Avoid anything made with aioli as they do not do a good job with this."
"NC","Seriously, how many F words can you not use on a Yelp review? How do you order app, a salad and three entrees.  Salad came first then bruschetta (wtf) toast and tomatoes and cheese.  Don't give it a sweet name and take 50 minutes to make it.  Also the fact that we order lasagna and you are out of it?  You couldn't tell me that during the 50 mins that you were making bruschetta?  How long does it take to make lasagna?  Wait someone told me longer I'm sorry I didn't go to culinary school, I guess nether did your cooks ""I use cooks loosely"".
I would recommend a better Italian place but I'm Scottish, I would say stay home drink beer and make macaroni and cheese!"
"NC","I was less than impressed. The meatballs were greasy and very bland. The price was extremely high for food that was bland and not impressive. Based on the reviews I was excited to try, but I will stick to Olive Garden or even Stouffers lasagna."
"NC","If the idea of awkwardly taking a tour of the kitchen followed by a maze through overrated Italian singers only to be led to a picnic table of the worst food ever... You are in for a good time.  DISGUSTING! Worst Italian food ever! They shouldn't even call it Italian food. It tastes like a frozen lean cuisine. The bread was even bad. Overpriced! Don't waste your time and money going here. 

This place really should receive a total of negative stars but yelp wouldn't let us post.   Sad"
"NC","We originally headed to Olive Garden for lunch while visiting the Charlotte, NC area. After finding that Olive Garden uses latex gloves during food preparation, we had to change our plans due to a latex allergy one our family members have. We called Buca and were assured they were latex free. 

What a great experience we had. From the friendly staff to the perfectly prepared food. Although not widely publicized, Olive Gardens food is ""heat and eat"", meaning your chef uses a microwave oven. Buca food was freshly prepared, served hot and cooked perfectly! The prices were inline with competitor chain prices but the quality was miles ahead. 

The restaurant was clean and decorated in that vintage style Italian home feel.  Being a Brooklyn born Italian, I have been in many Italian houses and trust me, they have the décor correct.

This is not meant to beat up Olive Garden, or compare Buca to a family owned Bensonhurst or Bay Ridge Brooklyn Italian restaurant, but to give heads up for meal options when traveling.

I normally would not rave about a chain restaurant, but this location deserves to be recognized."
"NC","Great family style Italian restaurant!!  Old school atmosphere, reasonably priced!!  Definitely an option for those who enjoy old school style Italian."
"NC","Love this place! Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Mmm table bread, Mountain Dew, & Caesar Salads!!"
"NC","After a good body massage me and my other 2 friends went to this place , the whole wall is decorated with variety of pictures :) , this place was so different , you can walk inside kitchen , there is even a booth near kitchen :) 
This restaurant has some art on the other side of the rooms , I will go next time to see them all :) 
We ordered cheese motzerila n garlic break , it was hot crunchy , yummy :) we ordered chicken  Parmesan family size for 3 of us and packed one for our other friend , it yummy de best I ever had , I would personally  prefer this over Olive Garden and magiannos , chicken was crispy , soft and juicy , tomato sauce was so fresh and i think they made from scratch , waitress was very good , she suggested me some cream soda , which was awesome , tables are quite close , which made me feel like family restaurant , I would go here again and again :)"
"NC","They had 3 hostess up front doing nothing and didn't even greet us. Booked reservation for 17 and she tried to cram us on 3 tables. We had no space to move elbows. Why would you even try to seat us like that? Reason I book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time. 

When I walk up front ask host if I can get a bigger table. She gave me an attitude. And was like ""sure"". Never got a apology for cramming us into a small table. The place is a family style with big dishes. The way they had us seated we wouldn't been able too move to grab our food. Terrible customer service and it was my birthday. Disappointment. Will never return to the restaurant."
"NC","My niece selected Buca for her birthday meal, so we were happy to take her. We took the tour through the kitchen on the way to our table, nice touch. Our waitress was super friendly and willing to answers our questions patiently.

Family style dining is fun, probably more so with a larger group to share with. We ordered a side dish of Alfredo for our niece because she couldn't eat a whole dish alone and neither my husband or I care for Alfredo ourselves. We decided to share the Quattro al Forno with ravioli, canneloni, manicotti and stuffed shells. We ordered a small, which states it is for 2-3 people to share. Hmm. Not sure I am buying that. It was a pretty small portion in my opinion for the money and the price. It was good, but not great. Chicken canneloni was my favorite.  The hubby ordered a meatball on the side and while it was big, he said it lacked the ooomph he was hoping for. Bummer.

We would go back with a group, but probably not on our own. I rounded up a 3.5 trip due to the great staff and eclectic atmosphere."
"NC","My son chose Buca for his birthday dinner.  There were 7 of us total and the toal bill was around $200.  No alcohol was ordered.  I was surprised how expensive it was.  The food was so-so.  I think the ""schtick"" here is the family style entrees.  When you order spaghetti and meatballs, you get a huge bowl of spaghetti with 2 or 3 meatballs the size of of a softball.  The meatballs were not very good and it was kinda awkward dividiing them up.  I'd rather have 8-10 smaller meatballs to share.

The atmosphere of the place is great... very Italian feel.  Can't rival a joint in the North End of Boston but they try.

Suggestion to the restaurant - move your dumpster.  It sits prominently in the parking area on the same side as the main entrance.  And, if the wind works against you, you get a full blast of all kinds of wonderful smells.  Not good going in and certainly worse going out!"
"NC","I wasn't as impressed with Buca as I wanted to be. I'd always thought this place looked a little cheesy  from the outside, but after years of business, I finally decided to try it out with some friends who were celebrating a new job. 

Bread and drinks were promptly brought to the table, along with a side of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. We decided to start with the mixed green salad, and added Gorgonzola and prosciutto on the side. Typically when I think of mixed greens, I think of mesclun, arugala, frissae, and other greens. Though I wouldn't expect these particular greens to be served in an Italian restaurant, I don't understand why they considered this salad ""mixed greens"". The only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage. I counted maybe five olives, and three pepperoncinis. The prosciutto and Gorgonzola were plentiful, though I'm not sure of the quality of prosciutto they use. It looked burnt and perhaps prepackaged like bacon bits. It was just okay as a whole. For our main dish, we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni. This is where the experience failed in my mind, as the chicken and peas did not taste fresh, and the sauce was lacking in depth and flavor. It just wasn't as authentic as I was hoping for. 

Service was fine, but I think I'll be skipping Buca next time I need a fix for Italian."
"NC","Originally left a bad reviw. Bur since then I was contacted by the district manager. You really seem to care about this restaurant's reputation. He said they're making improvements and that I should try it again. I told him I would and I will hold my review until I do that again. Everybody deserves a second chance."
"NC","Came for Thanksgiving thought it would be nice for a change boy was I wrong made reservations 2 weeks ahead of time was supposed to get kitchen table didn't get it ! Then went to order gnocchi waiter brand new says they don't have ordered a Guinness beer says we have it be right back comes back like 15 minutes later to tell me they don't have.this place used to be good boy did it go down hill ! So disappointed !"
"NC","This was our first visit. Cute kitschy place. Service was good- 4 stars.  Food was ok. Stuffed mushrooms- delish. 

I found it to be overpriced. Lasagna was slightly burned. Much better cold the next day. A granny apple salad was good but not $13.00 good.

Bread was very plain. 

Would we return? Probably not."
"NC","I don't know what has happened to Buca.  I have eaten here many times in the past 5 years both with friends and with my church group for which I am the social coordinator.  I have gotten take out meals and only had great things to say about this restaurant in the past.  The food was and is still good but not worth the treatment one now receives as a guest. 

 The wait staff had a total disregard and lack of respect for the patrons that was appalling.  Ours was poorly trained and had no back up or bus person.  Bread came out after the salad with no oil. By the time oil came, our bread was mostly gone.  We watched our desserts melt as we had neither spoons or plates to eat on.  I had dirty utensils dropped on me all while we froze to death after multiple requests to turn the air conditioning down.  After 4 requests a manager told us it had been done.  Within the hour it returned to meat locker status.  My church friends with arthritis were miserable and in pain due to the cold.  I had to go outside to try and warm up during my meal. I guess it was comfortable for the wait staff and those that may have been drinking alcohol.  For the rest it was a miserable an noisy environment.  It takes a lot for me to have to write this, but I was in tears thinking how my friend's Birthday celebration was ruined.  Needless to say  I will not be back nor will the groups I used to bring there."
"NC","We had a great experience at this restaurant. Everything we ordered tasted fantastic. The chicken Parmesan was fantastic and the tiramisu was awesome. It's is a great place to go with a large crowd."
"NC","I've been to this restaurant twice and the food is amazing. Someone wrote here that the food tastes like it's either frozen or straight out of a can. I've had frozen italian and canned italian. The first thing you notice when eating at Buca is how FRESH the food tastes. Even the herbs in it seem quite fresh and complimentary.  someone also wrote that the atmosphere was loud and that they sang birthday songs a lot. Well to get around that my advice is to eat at home. This an italian restaurant. Nothing should be quiet about it! Enjoy the food, enjoy the cuture and go home. Some people will complain about ANYTHING."
"NC","I absolutely love the family style type of dining. The staff was really friendly, the service was fast, and it felt like i was going to dinner at one of my relatives house! Pizza, pasta, salad....everything was great. Big groups are a must and they have monthly specials that cater to all celbrations that you may be planning."
"NC","First of, I really love Buca's food. It's really good and a favorite of mine and my roommate's is the Baked Ziti. We love the atmosphere of it and we honestly have a good time(usually) when we go but recently...the past few visits haven't been so great.

(03/13)Starting off with last night(Wednesday), my roommate and I planned to go  after I got off work for their National Raviolli day coupon. We got there at 9:20, 40 minutes before they closed. I know it's a little late but we can normally get done within that time frame. But when we walked in, we waited for a few minutes before the hostess finally walked into the waiting area...with her purse over her shoulder.

She told us they had already closed and after mentioning that we thought they didn't close until 10(we checked the website before going), she reluctantly took us to a table...in a room where everyone else was. It was a little awkward for us and after waiting for maybe 5 minutes while discussing whether we should stay or not, we left. The impression we got upon arriving, although late, left a sour note. We're both very disappointed and ended up settling for pizza(which is no where near as good as their food). I was really looked forward to it all day until I showed up.

(02/13)The time before that I went with my roommate again and a friend. We arrived an hour before close(again late I know) but this time we had no problem getting seats. Our problem was with the service. Our actual waitress didn't start serving us until AFTER our food had arrived. A waitress from a different section noticed us and helped us out until our waitress finally showed up. We didn't get refills until we had to stop someone to ask for them which shouldn't have been that hard when there honestly weren't more than four other groups there at the time. Again, it was disappointing.

(01/13)The time before that experience I went with my parents and three friends. It was a busy Friday night but we didn't have to wait long to get a table. The service was great but the annoying part was that every table but ours in the room claimed to be having a birthday. Literally every table. So we had to listen to their birthday song five times just in that one room while it went on in several other rooms. It ended up being very irritating and I honestly don't believe that everyone having a birthday in Charlotte that night would all go to Buca.

Overall I really love Buca Di Beppo's food but the service has increasingly gone downhill since our first try in early 2012. Now when I go I see more problems than good experiences and honestly, I think the only way I'll be getting their food from now on is if I go with a large group early on in the day or through take out(which is usually cheaper).

Sorry Buca...but I think you deserve this one."
"NC","Amazing place, went with a friend on a Saturday. Amazing pasta and variety of items. What makes it even better is the fact that they walk you through their kitchen before sitting you down on a table. Awesome food and good waiters. Prices are good too."
"NC","I hate to do this...I just hate to...but I have never experienced this before. I don't know if I can ever return to Buca. Firstly, I knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived. She just seemed...off...or high. She was very awkward and kept flirting with my date. Not only that, but she completely ignored me as if I wasn't sitting right there. 

To make matters worse...much worse, our yummy carbonara had a hair in it. A nice long blonde hair. I was done. I pulled it out and showed my date, he looked at it and told me to just get rid of it. Ok, I did, and I stopped eating. He kept eating lol, until...I found another hair!!!!!!!! Yuck!!!! There is nothing worse than someone else's hair in your food. The night was ruined for me, and we both stopped eating, I never speak up when I am unhappy about something. I am just naturally a friendly, non-confrontational girl, but I felt like I had to say something! No one should have to eat food with hair in it, and have to pay $19 for it. 

Alas, my date didn't want to make things more awkward since  out server seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown. So, I kept quiet against my better judgement. She later returned with the check, which was wrong, and claimed that she would have to pay the difference out of her pocket if she tried to change it. Confused! Then she asked us to do the survey and give her 5 stars. Ha! I just started laughing, I was sure this entire night was a joke. 

She literally said, as she knelt down to our table and clasped her hands as if in prayer (I couldn't make this up guys) I'm new here, could you please give me 5 stars, for the good of humanity, and for all those people without jobs in the world.) This was entertaining. Then, she proceeded to take my dates credit card and flirt with him some more! She touched his chest and asked if he had any brothers. Holy...cannoli... get me out of here! I was happy to leave, and planned to never return. That woman just creeped me out. Sorry Buca, a previous visit was much better than this one."
"NC","...called at 6p to see if they would take reservations for that night. yes, but not 7p... 7:15p is open. Cool, table for 4 at 7:15 it is. We arrived at 7:10 and were told we will call your name when a table is ready... at 7:25 I asked if our 7:15 reservation was ready yet and she said we are a little behind. There are a few still ahead of you... Our name was called at 7:46 after 4 tables of 4 and a table of 6 were seated. 
Anyone can take a reservation... Its the holding of the reservation that counts right? (UNHAPPY)
 The food was OK, a small salad for the table, 2 shared dinners for 4, a side of pasta with a meatball & 1, $12 bottle of wine and 2 deserts nothing worth going out of your way for at a cost of almost $150.00. There was also 5 or 6 ""birthday/clapping"" sessions around us like at Applebees.
The wait staff was nice, quick and good looking, but I'd rather have a slow, ugly waiter with good food myself.
No hurry to go back there... ever."
"NC","Good food and good service. Will definitely go back."
"NC","I have to give Buca di Beppo props on the ambiance they create.  You cannot find another restaurant like it (or if there is one - I am not aware of it).  

For those that are not familiar with Buca di Beppo, it is an Italian restaurant that serves family style meals.  Any dish you order is meant to be split between members of your party - so if you have a party of 2-4, you really only need to order 1-2 dishes for the party.  Me, being the picky eater that I am, I would rather order my own dish than share.  

At least with this experience, did not have the best server.  He did not seem to be too enthusiastic with his job.  He was willing to split the bill among the five people in our party, but one person in our group ordered an alcoholic beverage and the price of her drink was split amongst the people in our party.  

They might only do this if there are people in your party that have not eaten at Buca di Beppo, but when they take you to your table, they walk you through the kitchen (which has a table for patrons to eat their meals at).   The only plus side of going here for meals."
"NC","Oh, so tacky and cliche. That's what makes Buca di Beppo so great. From the Christmas-light-wrapped statues outside to photos of nuns running through the ocean inside, everything gaudy and over-the-top about Italian-American culture is embodied in the restaurant.

The experience starts with the escort to your table, which takes a detour through the kitchen (where there is also a booth table. In the kitchen.) and around by the Pope Room used for large parties (with a creepy wax bust on a rotating dais in the middle of the table).

Food is served family style. A ""small"" plate will feed 2 to 3 people. Everything is very tasty - I personally love the baked pasta dishes, the garlic bread, and their salads can be a meal by themselves, too. Not a place you want to come unless you are feeling hungry.

My only complaint is that their only Charlotte location is in Pineville and rather tough to get to for me. But when I'm in the area, a great place to stop!"
"NC","The food here is okay (2.5 stars)and does not completely satisify your appetite. Every time we have eaten here, we were hungry shortly after. Go figure. Well, the service here on the times we have visited has never knocked our socks off. Just okay. Very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy. It is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food. The garlic knots and calamari are consistently tasty. Not a place we want to run to on a regular, but good enough for a ""snack""."
"NC","Just went here for dinner. Dinners are family style and leave your appetite satisfied. Small spaghetti order has 2fist sized meatballs and can feed 3 people easily . Friendly service. But divey on purpose. Supposed to look like Joe's basement in 1960's era NY or NJ . Food better than average,but not Maggianos."
"NC","I  enjoyed the ambiance of Buca di Beppo at Universal City Walk in L.A. so I decided to book our Christmas Eve dinner at the more local to us Buca. The family had never been and I knew it would be fun. As you can imagine on Christmas Eve, they were running a little behind but not majorly. Our server was delightful. The food was good, nothing exciting, and the portions large, as they are known for family style dining. It is a great value and a lot of fun for large groups."
"NC","Two and a half stars, neither A-ok nor real bad. 
I was at Carolina Place around 1:30 pm and decided to give this restaurant a try -I was told it's the best Eyetalian in Charlotte.

First the good part: I ordered the baked rigatoni with meat sauce and hot Italian sausage. It was excellent -if like me you like strong flavors and spicy both- nothing I'd expect from a chain restaurant. The lunch portion was huge, too much in fact.
that's it for the good.

Service was absolutely dismal for no good reason. It was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch. I think the dinner prices are very high for Southern Italian style pasta dishes, especially considering we're in Charlotte and I think their idea of ""family dining"" makes life easier for the cook but does nothing for the customer. 

My idea of fun dining is exactly the opposite, I want to taste as many different things I can, not pig out on a mound of carbs."
"NC","12/26/11 7:45pm.
I go to the hostess station and request seating for one.  Hostess asks if i wish to be seated at the bar, and I politely declined.  She then said ""we are not taking any more walk in business tonight.""  

I have a suggestion on where this place can shove a few of their meatballs."
"NC","In my opinion, this place is only one star ahead of Olive Garden (which I don't care for )  in terms of the quality of the food... but it is pricier than OG. (Because of the price-point, I would acutally rate this place 2.5 stars instead of 3.) 

It is your typical Italian-American corporate chain cuisine. If you are hungry and want to find something ""nicer"" than the Olive Garden but not on the level of gourmet authentic Italian dining, this is an ok choice... especially if you are a family with lots of hungry mouths to feed.  

If it were totally left up to me, I would not choose to go here. Ever.  However, we have a lot of good friends who really like this place (??!!), so on occasion, I will suck it up and take one for the team.  

One problem from my perspective is the ""family style"" dining.  Typically, I am much pickier than my dining companions and I feel like I have to settle for something that I would not order if it were just up to me.  (And the same is true in the reverse, my dining companions try to find something to order that I'll actually eat). 

But, they do have enough options that I can find a chicken or seafood option. There are also a couple of selections of baked pasta that do not include meat sauce. 

When I eat ""Italian"" food, I typically like to enjoy a glass of wine or two. As expected for a place like this, the wine selection is not very good and is  more overpriced than the typical restuarant wine mark-up.  

Even with a coupon and not ordering the most expensive things on the menu, I generally end up paying more than I feel this place is worth. I'd prefer to take my business to a smaller locally owned restuarant any day - and especially when it comes to Italian food. 

I have only been a few times, but on each visit the service was a-ok.  The wait can be a little long depending on what time you get here, but the staff tries to make up for it by being super-friendly."
"NC","Let me start by saying their food is top notch, my favorite is baked rigatoni with whole wheat penne and I have the italian sausage replaced with ground beef. I wish they offered a small salad with the order instead of an addon but you definitely get your moneys worth in quantity. ALSO, if you are on the lookout there are ALWAYS buca coupons in the sunday papers, in valpak, and if you search for google apps on android. So if this was based on food I would give Buca a 5.

I took my Italian gf to Buca on her bday at her request and I must say the dining experience was the WORST either of us have ever experienced. We went during the week and they had maybe 8 different ""tables"" or groups dining in...they put us all in the same room (with the other 4-5 rooms EMPTY) and bunched us together with everyone. I'm literally sitting side by side with another group on a bench inevitably hearing every word of their conversation. Ideally you take your gf out on her Bday you want a private personable dinner where you can talk without hearing every word of someone elses conversation....that alone was bad when they had so much room in the restaurant. 

On top of that we had the worst waitress ever, Cassandra.....she harassed us literally every 2-3 minutes asking us if the food was okay, talking about the weather, etc...she was interrupting us CONSTANTLY. My gf and I began being short with her so she would let us enjoy our dinner and she just didn't take the clue. On top of that the host who worked at the front door kept coming back and doing the same, CONSTANTLY. It's nice that people care that your meal is okay, but theres no need to ask us how our meal is literally every few minutes when I'm eating the same thing. My gf and I could not talk without the constant interruption.

Horrible experience dine in but we have continued to go back for their TAKE OUT....We generally will call 20-30 mins in advance, then showup to get our orders and its still not ready often we'll have to sit there and wait another 10-20 mins like they didn't start it until we got there. The food is so good, and they give you SOOOOOO much (leftovers for days) it makes it worth it but the customer service is very low in my opinion."
"NC","We have been to Buca several times and generally have had a good experience.  We had the spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna.  It is family dining and the portions are large.  A small spaghetti is enough for two people and the same goes for the appetizers.  Good value. The food is good but nothing to rave about.  It is a place to go with the kids and have a decent meal.  However,  the service was very good. We wanted to change our table and the manager handled it right away.  The waiter checked on us frequently and took care of our requests quickly.  It is advisable to call ahead since it gets crowded on weekends."
"NC","We haven't been here in over a year and it was time to return and see if there was any changes. First, the decor is still cool...lots of pictures, statues, albums on the wall. We were greeted by everybody working there ---very nice. Ordered the apple Gorgonzola salad. It came out wrong and had to be reordered. This is a really wonderful salad....Unfortuately it took 15 Min's to get it the second time. Their bread used to be wonderful too.....hot and fresh full of flavor now it's just plain old french bread tasteless. 
Our entree of lasagna came out on a very hot plate but was cold but burnt on the bottom. Manager came to the rescue and immediately took care of the problem. I liked the idea of having the chef bring out the correct entree since it was his fault and not the waiter. 
Would I go back? Probably not, too many good Italian restaurants in the area that are better"
"NC","Mama Mia that's some good cheese......

Stopped by the mall on the way home the other night, and somehow ended up at the end of the parking lot in a dead end right in front of Buca Di Beppo.  Not sure what drove me into this location tonight, as I have only heard of the GINORMOUS portion sizes, and we were in the mood for something very light, and did not want anything real heavy. I know, this is Italian and everything is heavy, but we decided to give them a try since the parking lot was not nearly as full as normal.  (That could be good, or that could be bad) Anyhooo...we felt like an adventure none the less.

Since this was our true ""first visit"" we felt in order to take the tour....through the maze, into the kitchen, (hey look someone is actually eating in the kitchen) and onto the myriad of other rooms, finally locating our table in a room, with just one other ""festive"" couple.  Apparently a few servers had been cut, so there were a few questions as to who actually had our table.  One would think that was bad, however we did have at least three servers attend to our needs at the very beginning.

Of course, by now, you know I drink water, and my better have always has sweet tea. The drinks were quickly presented and we placed our very huge order of just the Mozzarella Cheese.  We had the complimentary basket of bread, with Olive Oil / Balsamic Vinegar, to help soak up the very tasty Marinara Sauce left over from the Cheese Sticks.

The portion sizes were reasonable for the price, and as expected, it was enough to feed both of us, especially the 2 sections of bread.

This will be on the list for us to visit later on, we when are hungry.

Service was fast and friendly.

"NC","Close by grocery store ... Open 24 hrs - but count on it ... If you have a need for something specific - there's a good chance they will be out of it or have discontinued carrying it ... This place is not dependable for the real groceries... Go to Harris Teeter or Trader Joes for that ... This is good for creamer or milk or eggs ... Maybe ...  Also watch the cashiers - famous for over charges and not giving credit for coupons even after they're mentioned to them ... Most definitely pay attention to your charges !"

"NC","I moved to the area not long ago. Never been a Bilo customer but it's the closest store to my apartment. Only a couple times have I ever not been able to find what I needed. I would like a bigger craft beer selection, but that's not a deal breaker. The staff here is wonderful and so friendly. The store always runs amazing specials. I'm very happy with my experience here and will definitely continue shopping here!"
"NC","Unless you have no other choice do not shop here.  The store is horribly dirty and the prices are higher then Harris Teeter.  If you come after 10 you can hang out with the manager smoking outside (That's where he always is) or you can buy out of date bakery products.  If you question my review take a moment to go visit the men's bathroom.  It is disgusting and can be smelled 10 feet before you even get to the door."
"NC","About me:
- New to NC/SC area
- Student budget
- Veg/Vegan 
- Healthy eats

Like with any grocery store, you have to go to their website and check out the weekly deals and online coupons. 
I love grocery shopping. I find it super fun. Because I'm on a student budget I like to stay creative with my food but health at the same time. I'm always on the look out for good deals. 

In general, items at Bi-Lo are less expensive compared to places like HT, Food lion. However if you're into the whole, organic food diet, then this is not the place for you. 
Produce selection is limited. Meats look fresh ( I wasn't vegetarian all my life so I still know what fresh meat looks like!). Bakery selection VERY limited. Seafood didn't see much. 

Limited but good prices!"
"NC","I love Bi-Lo Butts......Pork Butts that is, just for my own Famous BBQ.

I am not a big fan of Bi-Lo, but when it comes to friends and family wanting the absolute best BBQ, it must come from here.....

Here's why:
They offer the correct sizes needed to feed a small army, with just the right amount of fat content to slow cook this bad butt into a wonderful piece of food art.

Bi-Lo prices are much better than the competitors and seem to offer this piece of meat on specials a little more frequently than others.

The service is friendly, but again, I only shop here for the butts.

I find that they do offer a good variety of meats and other goods, but the butts are hands down the best value.  They do offer a butcher on site if needed for any choice cuts you may need.

"NC","I have been a long time fan but after having a issue with an item I purchased online this Christmas I will not be shopping here again. I tried to take a item back with the packing slip that came on the item, the associate told me I was unable to do the return with the packing slip but she could do it if I had the email confirmation.. I didn't have it on my phone so I went.. I found the email sent it back to my phone and tried the return again.. todays associate told me I could not do the return with the confirmation email but needed the packing slip.. which I could not find at the time. I asked to speak with the manager on duty which the associate called.. Valencia the manager on duty would not come up to speak with me but told the associate that they couldn't do the return.. I still have this 100.00 worth of stuff I don't need.. I would not recommend anyone from purchasing from Kmart!"
"NC","I wanted to bring some snacks back to Canada with me that we can't there. K-mart wouldn't be my first choice, but it was right across the street from my hotel so convenience was the factor here. The store wasn't busy, yet it didn't seem to be in the most organized state. Overall, the look of the store just seems to be tired.

The cashiers were friendly, but other than a couple of employees stocking shelves the store seemed to be a bit of a ghost town."
"NC","Hello friends,

This is probably the BEST K-Mart in a Super PRIME location.  Located across the street from Carolina Place Mall, nice Chain Restaurants, Dick's Sporting Goods, near Home Depot, hotels, hospitals, & a Highway. 

^^^ whatever you need is within 5mins radius!

Now on to K-Mart itself. I've been to this location a number if times. Always clean, every employee SEEMS nice. I was up & at it early in the morning and every employee I walked pass or walked pass me greeted me with a Good Morning & a smile. Asked if I needed any help etc. I seem to be out early whenever I go shoppin so I usually see people stocking and cleaning. 
 I would recommend this K-Mart to anyone. I've had good experiences here, I would only hope you & yours can as well. 

Until next time....TTFN!!"
"NC","I actually went to this store because I was out running errands and decided to pick up a new bathroom scale... I started out in the front of the store and happened upon a group of employees, working on putting an aisle together... They were having a pretty hilarious conversation, judging only by the volume... I thought I was in the right area, so I didn't ask for help... Turns out I wasn't, so I had to head back over... I said hi and excused myself since they were deep in the throes of their conversation and asked if anyone knew where they kept the scales... Out of the four people, only one of them even acknowledged me... Her answer? I don't even know where they are, they moved them... lol   She DID walk with me to find them in a place she thought they were after she said that...  I was so hoping that wouldn't be the end of the interaction, but the fact that she said it cracked me up... lol  That being said, it's K-Mart... It still has the same old K-Mart smell, cheap prices and layaway that you remember...  But isn't that precisely why we love it?"
"NC","The K (Big, Super or Regular) is the place where retail dreams go to die.

At many other establishments, if you need to return something sans receipt, they might give you a hard time, but they will at least courteously tell you that you'll have to pay a reduced price based on the lowest selling price over the last few weeks. And more importantly, they tell you that UP FRONT. At the K - hopefully no relation to the Bruces we know and love here in Crown Town - you have to provide identification, address and phone number before they will even tell you what you can get for your marked-down merch. Then you get to walk about in a daze in the hopes that you can find something else to buy. Or you could donate the card to the needy and let them deal with the problem.

Should you decide to walk the aisles of the damned, you are not treated to the relatively bright and well-lit or recently remodeled stores of any other establishment that wants to attract customers. No, here they buy outdated flat screens to seem that they are keeping with the times and hang them from the ceiling. Monitor stands and all. No fancy boxes, just a computer monitor hanging from above. Not even turned on. Really? Had I happened by prior to the holidays, that gift card would have made its way to the red kettle out front - if they would have accepted it."
"NC","Kmart is the ""also-ran"" of big box stores. I don't know any that have a large grocery section but they do have a decent selection of general merchandise, clothing, personal care, toys, and housewares. I needed to get a plant as a last minute gift for a friend (never show up empty handed!). I had been planning to hit the home and garden department at the store further back in the mall, but gave the Big K a chance. Good move - they had exactly what I needed and at the right price. This makes Bruce a happy shopper!"
"NC","Wow the guy at the counter is a boss!!! Really nice and the food was perfect and that's saying alot cause I'm a picky eater and order weird stuff. Restaurant was clean and we'll manged touche taco bell!!!"
"NC","I'm stuck between TWO and THREE stars. After all it is Taco Bell. 

You can usually count on them for cheap and fast food. The cheap part is always standard. But, the fast part for this location has struggled for a while. I mainly visit this location for weekday work time lunch breaks (12 or 1 pm.)

Maybe I should give them some slack because most places are slammed around this same time, but I feel they could step it up a bit and decrease the wait time a little.

Although, I do really have zero complaints on the food. After all it is Taco Bell."
"NC","Coming to a US Taco Bell is always an interesting experience.

First-off, there's no fries in US TB's. I learned that years ago when a group I was with apparently offended an employee by asking for fries supreme. It was like we were attacking a sacred family recipe by wanting ground beef and cheese on fries instead of nachos.

Second, the combos come with a taco, not with a side like you would get in Canada. If you want nachos supreme you have to make a special request.

Third, it's so much cheaper here. This is pretty standard across all fast food in the States. $5 for a Gordita combo here. Over $6 in Canada.

For this restaurant in particular, the service was good and the food came up quite fast. They have a choice of three different Doritos tacos. Hopefully they bring that choice to Canada soon.

Good call by the person who left the tip to swap a Doritos taco into a gordita. Delicious."
"NC","Seriously I waited in the drive thru for like 10 minutes. Finally I actually called the store and asked if there was a problem. The manager was like no why? So I explained that we had all been sitting there for forever and I was trapped in the drive thru and couldn't get out and could he please start taking orders. His response was oh sorry I accidentally turned my headset off go ahead with your order. (I was 3 cars away).  Anyways I got my usual cantina bowl and it was okay... not great even by Taco Bell standards."
"NC","Always fast clean yummy and the manager dude is on point as far as high customer service. They messed my taco up. He smiled, personally made the correct taco, and said have a nice day in less than 30 seconds. :)))"
"NC","Ah yes...time again for some new living room furniture.  After getting new sofas every couple of years, we decided to give some leather furniture a try.

We found a couple of beautiful pieces and got a quote from our salesperson, Jeff.  We thanked him and went to check out some competitors' options to compare.  I'm not a huge fan of the all-day shopping events, and my preference was for the Haverty's pieces, so I decided to go back and see if Jeff could knock off the shipping charges to keep the price around 3 grand.

He looked incredibly annoyed (and why wouldn't he...it eats into his commission).  He had to ""speak with someone"" about getting the price down.  He also asked if I would buy today if he could get the price of the shipping knocked off.  Which of course, led to my belief that I'd be pulling out my wallet in a couple of minutes.

Here's where my decision to find a new store, or at the very least, work with another salesperson comes into play.  When speaking with Jeff, I expressed that I wanted to stay around or under 3 grand to stay within my budget...that...and...my wife wasn't exactly thrilled about purchasing a leather set to begin with.

Annoyed that I was asking for ""free shipping"" ($120) on a $3,000 purchase, Jeff decides that the best thing to tell me...is...that I should have been looking at furniture I can afford.  Did he really just say that?  There's no way I heard that, right?

Now there's two sides to me...the one that could have handed him my business card and discussed the difference between the words ""budget"" and ""afford,"" and the one that was in total shock as he walked away to talk to a manager.

While my nature tends to lean towards the former, I was certain that any discussion past this point would have been a waste of breath.

To be fair, i was already receiving a $100 discount for every thousand I spent (not including the $300 warranty).  Since the price only came to $2700 without taxes and warranty, it would only be $200 off. 

I walked in to speak with Jeff for a deal on shipping.  I was prepared to leave and buy elsewhere if he was unwilling to negotiate.  

The only reason I'm updating my review is to bring light to a poor choice of how to speak to a customer and an unwillingness to be flexible.  

Profit margin is considerably higher in the furniture business than in most other retail outlets.  As a returning customer I expect some flexibility in maintaining the relationship.  Acting like the $120 delivery charge would bring the net profit below all costs was absurd...and if it's not absurd...Haverty's business model must be."
"NC","i ordered a piece of furniture from havertys in April for Delivery in June.  When the piece was delivered it was damaged, which is fine but the way they handled the situation was far from professional.  i was initially told i'd have to wait another month to get the piece then i was informed that i'd recieve it a week later.  Prior to delivery i was told there had been an error and the only piece they had left was damaged.

we reached out to another haverty's asking about their floor unit asking if they were able to sell that similarly to how the other store had, they declined.  On 7/4 I cancelled my order, went to a competitor and ordered furniture to fill two rooms in my new home.  

my issue here is that my cancellation and payment was apparently never issued, i spoke with Haverty's on Friday asking about the status of my refund, they advised me to call in Monday so i did and they said it was never processed.  i finally got in touch with someone to process my refund on Monday.

Overall this was a very poor experience, my salesperson was great and i liked the products offered, but i would never deal with this company just given the situation which was triggered by one individual issue."
"NC","We ordered a curio cabinet from Havertys. The sales people were friendly and did not pressure us or follow us around. It was delivered a few days later. Unfortunately, the top was badly damaged and we sent it back. Havertys kept us updated on when the replacement was being delivered (within a few days). New one arrived in perfect condition. After that, we received a phone call from the sales person, making sure we were happy. Great experience. Wish I could say the same for the other furniture chains in this area."
"NC","Really pleased with Haverty's and especially the salesman on the floor - Dennis. He never hovered but seemed to have a sixth sense about when to show up and answer a question we had. Ended up buying a couch and two chairs for the living room... quality seemed to be really good as well. We went to about four different furniture stores all around the Carolina Place Mall area and found the service and quality at Haverty's to be the best... hands down. 

Super impressed and very happy with our experience. 

Thumbs up, five stars - highly recommended!"
"NC","They are friendly and nice but I purchased a broken desk and took a week for them to replace. The customer service is nice but not much help. 

Also, don't trust their delivery window ... 3-5pm?!? Try 6:30. And would have been nice if you called to let me know."
"NC","Repeat customer.  Delivery tracking is great, sales reps were helpful.  Cancelling off an extra piece before delivery was easy and refunded quickly.  Recommend"
"NC","I've always had good experiences with Haverty's.  The sales people have always been friendly and helpful, without pushing too hard.

The furniture can vary from piece to piece, but most of it is of decent quality.  What I appreciate about Haverty's, is that you can browse...instead of consulting with an ""expert.""  Frankly, I like Haverty's and Ethan Allen, but the latter is always such a pain in the butt when I go there to get a piece of furniture.

Haverty's will have something that will fit the bill, but you may have to wait a while for it to reach your home.  

Lastly, the prices here are very inexpensive (this is obviously subjective) compared to other quality furniture stores.  I'd compare Haverty's to Target.  It's not the top level, not the bottom level, but it's fun to shop there."
"NC","Omgoodness! Went with the other reviews and tried Genaro's. This was some of the best food ever and we eat out a lot, everywhere and all cuisines. The rotisserie chicken held up to the reviews as the BEST we've  ever had! The sauces were crazy fantastic too. From the Aguadito soup to the plantains to the cilantro rice to the most awesome Tres Leches. Wow. If you're in the area or anywhere  near Pineville, NC definitely recommend. Service and recommendations  from Luis were greatly appreciated  as well. 5 stars. We are bookmarking  this one and are so happy it's only 1/2 hour away:-)"
"NC","9/7/2014 Went here for late lunch with a friend after running errands near the mall. I've been here at this location a few times before with great results. Today not so much. Our server Jeff was the worst waitstaff I've encountered in many years.

could never find him, and when we did was having conversation with other female employee. had to get up and find my own pepper mill that had something in it. had to ask the hostess several times for assistance. 

15 minutes after order our salads come, I needed more dressing so we had to search him out in the place because we couldn't see him anywhere fro over 5 minutes. 
after 45 MORE minutes our meals came. 

I ordered the parmesan crusted ribeye, med rare and the French onion soup. she ordered the ribeye as well and I don't remember what side. 

my steak was cool (not cold) and over done to a medium ALSO the cheese on my soup had solidified! so this tells me that our meals SAT in the back so long they got cold. my friends meal was also cool - all of it!

She said NOTHING but by now I am pissed off, the guy never refilled our drinks - we had to ask for others to get it and by the time he remembered we had probably needed a refill we were already done drinking half of what the last person we begged for liquid from gave us. 

I told the hostess that this guy needs a lot more training because he is the worse server I have ever come across, I FIRED servers who weren't this bad when I was a head waitress for 2 years!

the only reason WHY this place got 2 stars is because of the manager (Alberto I think his name was) came over and I showed him my meal, told him of all the issues we had, but what I was most disappointed with is the obvious WAIT time to get the cold food- which was NOT the kitchens fault. 
He personally promised to go cook my steak himself (he said it just takes 8 minutes!) WOW then Jeff should explain the 45 minutes we waited for our 8 minute steaks. (keep in mind there was only about 4 tables occupied, including ours, in the whole place)

finally finished our meals and we would've left $1 tip instead of the $5 bill, but that was the smallest bill we had and we had to leave. And this arrogant little dude is going to come over and start making excuses to us? says he was doing all he could to help us? that he didn't know there was a problem? that he had been there 3 months and never had a complaint? (well the manager said he had been there 1 month- I believe the manager) and maybe SO JEFF no one complained- ya know what most PEPLE DONT- they just DON'T come back!"
"NC","Being apart of  the Darden company I knew what to expect which was great service. My family received just that. Ashley was our server and she was awesome. Our food was nice and hot and was on time. Thank you Longhorn family!!!"
"NC","The meal was Filet, with asparagus and salad though right now I am not eating oil of any kind so the salad was not an option - I opted for the grilled shrimp instead ... Steak was delicious - the asparagus was cooked to death and worn out and the grilled shrimp was good though the manager wanted no part of offering any consideration of discount for the salad I didn't order ... 
Long story short - go to Outback Steakhouse right around the corner and get treated remarkable and get food you want with no hassles mate ! 
Won't make this mistake again - too many choices in Charlotte to have to dicker over $6.00 !  Outback would not only have accommodated my request but would have checked to make sure I was happy ... 
Longhorn was NOT crowded - hum. ... Probably why ... Carlos the manager is cheap and not customer friendly !"
"NC","Hostess was very nice. 
Sat at the bar, usually you get impeccable se4vice sitting there.
Took almost 5mins before being noticed and never by the other one. Received drink order and was able to order dinner in a timely matter.
Received food and had to find our own salt and pepper shakers.  Then almost done with steak and finally bartender comes to check on us...wanted a steak sauce. Then to wait on the bill.
You would think they were swamped being Saturday night at 9 but not really, 1/2 the bar empty."
"NC","Service was still excellent, I ordered the outlaw ribeye my gf ordered the salmon. Both were cooked perfect and my steak was seasoned perfect. Thank you to the staff for giving us the gift card. We will deffinetly be back in the future. It must have been an off night before."
"NC","We got here a little before 5 PM hoping to beat the crowd and not have to wait to be seated-The place was empty except for the 5 or 6 parties ahead of us in the waiting area who made the same mistake-We were expected to happily wait until 5 when more servers would start work-We left.Don't pretend to be open and not be ready to serve hungry customers!I like the food here and think it's a pretty good value for the $60 or so we spend for the two of us,but there's lots of other places to spend that money-"
"NC","Consistency is what I like about Long Horn. Still the best place for a steak under $25 anywhere. Even their sirloins are great and you can mostly cut with a fork. The Filets you can always cut with a fork.  A dash of salt and pepper is all I ever need to put on their steaks.

The salads at Long Horn, this is where they need to step up their game. Let's do something other than ice berg lettuce guys!"
"NC","They get two for the great service but everything else was not so good. I had a ribeye which was cooked to the right temperature. It was seasoned with a TON of salt and a pound of butter. Sweet potato also had too much butter. My gf got the lobster chops the lobster was overcooked and tough to get out of the shell. It should be easy when it comes split already right? Her corn on the cob was undercooked. So all in all the service is good but the food sucks. We will not be coming back again."
"NC","The meal was good.  The usual, chain steakhouse quality. ... except the 18 oz rib eye came with a 5 oz bone in it.....Typically the servers are at least attentive at the longhorn.  Today our server would have preferred she didn't have people to wait on.  The restaurant wasn't busy but getting a new drink was almost impossible....and you better be satisfied with the old mug cause getting a new frosty mug with the 2nd beer was not going to happen."
"NC","Love this place. Eat here once a week. Great food staff and the place is clean. 5 star because there is nothing negative that you can say."
"NC","This used to be my favorite steak house in Charlotte.  It's really gone downhill lately.  The last 2 times I've eaten here the prime rib was still cold.  I told the waiter to take it back and cook it some more.  He brought it back STILL COLD.  I realize prime rib is best rare, but this guy just didn't get it.  Nice waitresses and free peanuts though."
"NC","Absolutely wonderful service and the Half Shredded Prime Rib Sandwich and Loaded (and I do mean loaded) potato soup is stupendous"
"NC","The staff was on point, we had a large group of eight dinning out last Friday.  The waitress moved quickly ensuring everyone had an enjoyable evening.  I had the parmesan encrusted mushroom sirloin steak, it was tender with wonderful flavor and properly cooked to requested medium well.  But, at the other end of the table my family member enjoyed a steak cooked to medium rare, a true sign your at a good steak house to me is the steak cooked the way you order it!!  YUMMY eats!!!"
"NC","We ordered the lobster and shrimp dip. We had to send it back twice because it was too cheeseeeee.. yes!! The chips kept breaking whenever we dipped it in the sauce because the cheese made it to heavy. They ended up taking it off the bill. We then tried the parmesan chicken and bake potato. It was gooood!!! It was enough for two to share."
"NC","All the guys in our family love steak, so this has always been a destination for my family and I just for casual dining on a Sunday night.  The waiters are always pleasant and even conversational, and they're really on top of things.  The sides and salads are great, and the steaks are cooked just the way we each prefer.  The flavor of the steaks are just okay though, mine personally was a bit too salty last time.  But it doesn't take away that this is still a great place to be a repeat customer at."
"NC","Awesome burgers and fries. Add a cold beer to it and youre set! if you drink that is. :)"
"NC","Dinner last night at bar. Actually a great steak with super service. Enjoyed. Wasn't too crowded and surprisingly quiet. Recommended."
"NC","For us minions who can't afford places like Sullivan's and Ruth's Chris......this is easily the best steakhouse around. My wife and I have gone to all the other middle class steakhouses (Lonestar, Texas Roadhouse etc.) and this is our favorite. 

The steak is always juicy and cooked perfectly and their sides don't taste like they were nuked in the microwave. 

Try the Rancher Sirloin with the bacons, sunny side egg, and hollandaise. It's awesome."
"NC","Great steaks for the price. Always good service. Don't get me wrong, they aren't the greatest steak place. But the best in the affordable/causal range."
"NC","My son and I dined here recently.  He's a steak fan and I was looking for something he would eat!  My son ordered a Rib eye (standard) and I ordered the Parmesan Encrusted Chicken w/ a sweet potato and veggies.
Our meal was prepared well and it didn't take very long.  My son's steak was cooked properly and since he ""woofed"" it down, I suppose it was pretty good!
My Parmesan chicken was excellent.  There were two pieces on the plate so I was quite satisfied with the serving size.  The sweet potato was average in size and properly cooked (baked); not burnt.  I always look for the fresh veggie sides these days and Longhorn didn't disappoint.  Very tasty!
We were very pleased with the service!  Our waitress kept our beverages filled and was most attentive!"
"NC","Don't let a good place down.  Longhorn consistently provides a good value and great food.

I had to drive a few minutes from downtown to get here, it's near the BestBuy in a mall area.  Classic exterior and very nice interior with a comfortable bar area and large dining areas, which would be great for a company function or family dinner.

Personally I like their Salmon and Sierra Chicken meals more than their steaks, but when I have had a steak it is top quality.  I think their grilled chicken is the best anywhere.  Choices of sides and a salad for a reasonable price.

Definitely will be returning to this location."
"NC","The restaurant and corporate did follow up with me. They sent a letter of apology, refunded the overcharge, and gave us a decent gift card to give them another chance. My wife and I were hesitant to use the gift card at this location, but that's what we ended up doing. That visit was definitely better than the previous one. For the response to my complaint, I thank the management and corporate office for their sincere concern and willingness to make the situation better. They did all this within a month of that first fateful visit. I know this was a year ago, but I thought it would only be fair to them to post a follow-up to my scathing review.

Based on the second visit, it may not be the best steak house in the area, but we would go back again if we hadn't moved out of the area."
"NC","The only reason I went with my wife was because their management sent me a gift card as a sorry note because one of their waiting staff mistreated us at another restaurant location.

Really convenient location right next to the mall, which I think is why this place does OK. Place was packed at 7 PM, but the service was great - we were immediately seated, got our drinks (and timely refills) and our food was brought out in a timely fashion as well. Overall a very decent experience.

The reason for the 3 star experience is not because I'm docking this particular restaurant for doing something wrong, but instead rating this restaurant compared to the other Steakhouses I've dined at. This place is average at best."
"NC","GREAT steaks, prepared just the way it was ordered. Highly recommend the Portabello mushroom steak. Fast, friendly service."
"NC","This is based on my last visit , as I had almost given up on Longhorn after a previous BAD experience since the new renovations and menu change.

For starter's if you have NOT been to longhorn within the last year, they have a whole new menu, the prices have increased, and there is no more value menu.

We usually do call ahead seating when eating out, but this time we opted for ""let's just see how busy they are"", because if it was anything like our last visit the place should be empty.  Upon entering the door, the wait was approx 20 min, but I spoke to the host, and while it was just two of us, we opted for any seats that were available.  We were immediately sat, and we were seated right next to the kitchen. (Usually this is the worst seat in any restaurant).  

We were greeted by our server, ""Chuck"" he was very friendly, and promptly took our drink order.  The bread was quickly brought to the table which was still very warm, and the butter melted with ease. At this time I looked over the menu, and opted for the (limited time only special ) Rainbow Trout w/ Shrimp / Lobster Filling w/ Rice Pilaf and House Salad.  I have added a photo of the meal.

My wife had the Filet Mignon, with steamed vegetables and a house salad.  It was cooked perfectly, and the vegetables were awesome.  We were very pleasantly surprised.

My meal with the trout was excellent, and I was very excited that this location finally put GOOD SERVICE, and a GOOD MEAL together at the same time.

After this visit, I give them a four, because the server, who was stationed right beside us (at the kitchen door) was right on top of the service, with drinks, and with removing the dishes as they were emptied.

We skipped on the dessert this time, as we were very full from our meal.  but we what saw pass by us, looked very enticing.

I am all about second chances, and this was a redeeming factor for this location.

Kudos to the management, and to our wonderful server ""Chuck"".

We will be back, and would recommend giving these folks a try.

Best Regards,
NCFoodGuy"
"NC","Let me preface this by saying I only came here because I was given a gift card. After reading the reviews I was less than excited, but hell, it was going to be free! 
Got to the restaurant around 4:45 for an early dinner. Walked in, there were about 5 parties sitting in a very full waiting room. No employee visible, the hostess stand deserted. The only employee I could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender!
After waiting for about 5, a girl came up, and asked how many in our party. I responded ""two of us, but is there a wait??"" She responds, ""yes at least 10-15 minutes"".
At this point I look around the restaurant, way more empty tables then full. Like David K stated, I understand the shifts and seating requirements in a restaurant, but customer service and perception is always #1. 

Needless to say, I walked out before we were seated, fearing what could come of this experience. From the other reviews it seems I didn't miss anything. Seems it all boils down to poor management. It is not the employees fault if the manager has no clue how to run a business."
"NC","I wouldn't be so quick to hand out only one star, but after much consideration, I can't give this place any more. My wife and I went on a Thursday night. The place was less than half full, yet the hostess had us wait between 5-10 minutes for them to clean a table before seating us. Seems kind of asinine when there are plenty of empty seats throughout the restaurant. I understand that due to staffing they may have wanted to sit us in a particular server's section, but I believe customer service is all about perception. Our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic.

The food was a mixed bag. My wife enjoyed her LongHorn Salmon, but my Renegade Top Sirloin was ruined by being served completely drenched in oil. I've eaten at Longhorn in Maine a couple of times, and don't remember their steaks being served this way. If this is normal here, then I much prefer the steaks at Texas Roadhouse for this price range. My lobster tail was good, and not overcooked. For dessert, my wife and I shared a Caramel Apple Goldrush. This was most excellent, and almost warranted an extra star.

The main reason for the one star is what happened after our visit. I had left a $10 cash tip, and filled out the credit card slip to reflect this. A few days later, when the charge showed up on my credit card statement, I found that an additional $10 had been added. I immediately went back to the restaurant and spoke very cordially with a manager, showing him the receipt for my visit and my credit card statement. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's how a business handles a customer after a mistake is made that sets the tone for future business. The first thing he did, after researching the error in the back, is offer a $10 coupon. That is not acceptable to me, because to take advantage of this, I'd have to eat here again. He asked me what he should do (isn't HE the manager?), and I suggested that he credit the overcharge back to my card, or void/refund the full amount, and recharge it. I was told that I'd have to fill out a form that would have to be faxed to corporate, then I'd have to wait an unknown number of days to see the amount credited back to my card. I understand that there may be corporate policies that he has to follow, but there seemed to be very little compassion or empathy on his part. He should have still offered the coupon or maybe a comp'd entrée for the trouble of driving all the way back to the store because of a pretty significant error one of their employees made. No such luck. I would not have necessarily accepted the offer, but the gesture would definitely be appreciated and goes a long way towards a customers' perceptions about how important they are to a business. I do have a background in customer service management, and this would have never flown under my watch.

My wife and I have never been disappointed at Texas Roadhouse in Matthews, where the staff has always been enthusiastic and the food is exactly what we expect at this style of restaurant. I guess we'll stick with that when we're in the mood for a slab of beef and all the fixin's."
"NC","We like Longhorn, but not this location.  The service here is mediocre at best.  Tonight it took 10 minutes to order drinkes at the bar, 10 more minutes to get them and 10 minutes when we had to pay to go to our table.  When we go to the table, it was not ready for us to sit and we had to wait until cleanup was finished. When we eventually got the appetizer the bread, there were no plates around.  10 more minutes to get plates.

When the food finally arrived, there was only a passing similarity between the menu pictures and what we received. My Caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland.

Worst experience in a long time."
"NC","Prior to this visit , I was a Longhorn virgin.  So to be fair, this review is based only on my very first visit which was good and I'd go back if I could press replay on this visit.
That being said, I am surprised by the low rating here. 

Three of us shared the Texas onion (similar to OB bloomin onion) but we liked this version better.Wild west shrimp was also shared. Cherry peppers gave it a nice zing.

Salads that came with the entrees were fresh and big. Had we known it came already dressed, we would have asked for it on the side.But it was a perfect amount anyway.

I had the porterhouse, great, cooked the way I like it. Nice tender ,flavorful. Mashed taters were good.

Friend had filet (7oz.) again, tender,cooked the way requested, good. Served with giant loaded baked potato.

Last dish was a new menu item ( I don't know how new, like I said this was my first visit.)Parmesan crusted chicken . 
Menu states "" two juicy chicken breasts grilled and topped with parmesan cheese and garlic crust."" Surprisingly, It was described just as it was served. She enjoyed it!

Service was great ! So much to the fact when the manager came over to check in and see if we enjoyed our dinner , I made a point to compliment the excellent service.( I'm sure the verbal compliment was just the icing on the cake. The real compliment was the nice tip I left !

I'm not sure if they have a lunch menu But I did notice the dessert menu.None of us had room for dessert.

The place is big and looked as if it had a private dining spot.

Listen, I am not a steak house aficionado.But based on this visit, I like Longhorn chain better then O.B and L.S."
"NC","i used to work at this location in high school - back then it was great food and a fun atmosphere. Things have really slipped since then though. They drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese....  I thought it was supposed to be a healthy dish (?)....
My sweet tea wasn't sweet at all, which was UBER disappointing for me because I hadn't had sweet tea in 8 months because I moved up north...
My soup was alright - French Onion - pretty standard. 
My friend enjoyed his meal though so that was cool. But he wanted to satisfy a sweet tooth after his lunch and the server never suggested desert. He suggested everything else that we ddin't want but I guess he just gave up and figured we wouldn't want it anyway. 
Nothing great and I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again..."
"NC","C'mon folks, w/all the great places to get a steak in the Charlotte area, from Longhorn pricing to high dollar steaks elsewhere, why is ANYONE going to Longhorn??...its never been more than an ""OK"" steakhouse at its best, and that locations glory days, so to speak, have been in its rearview mirror for probably 5+ years....."
"NC","Maybe I'm spoiled by the Longhorn near my house, which is always good...

When I arrived at 7:30pm on a Sunday evening, I was treated as if the restaurant was about to close.  The hostess was very short with me and my date.  She walked us to a table, dropped the menus, and walked away.

The server (never told us his name) came by the table and got our drink order.  No personality and didn't make us feel welcome.  We ordered eventually.  No personality, still.  (Are they closing soon?)

Dinner arrived and my steak didn't taste right.  My date didn't like her steak either.  The manager came by and offered next to nothing to make things right.  I eventually requested some A1 and dowsed my steak in that.

The best part of dinner was the sweet tea."
"NC","Gluten Free/Allergy Sensitive (menu on-line)

It was clean and the service was good but, the food was medicore at best. If you can't have a great cheeseburger at a steak house then you have problems."
"NC","Big box pet supply store, located way at the back of the shopping plaza. Behind even the Home Depot!

Once you're in, they have everything you need for the furry, feathered or scaled creatures in your life. Food, toys, litter, cages, crates, dishes, aquariums and so much more. This store also offers obedience training for dogs (cats, not so much).

And they had exactly what I needed, a tag engraving station so that I would make one with my name and phone number. For $8.00, a little expensive."
"NC","very nice store. the selections are fairly good for all types of animals. they at ban field vets have a traveling aviary doctor which was a little inconvenient seeing as I needed one that day.
the bird toys are slim for large birds. the bird foods and treats selections is very good. I like the dog treat section also they have a much better variety than the average grocery store or wal mart. one of my dogs is a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs 3lbs she is no bigger than a can of soda with legs and has very few teeth. the training rewards treats are perfect for her tiny mouth and soft enough for her to chew.

I have walked around the store some and all areas have a good variety to choose from no matter what you are looking for.
 I love that I can take my animals in the store. the staff has always been very attentive and friendly"
"NC","Took Luna for her check up at the Banfield in Petsmart. The staff was wonderful and informative. They answered all of our questions. You could tell that the staff genuinely love working with animals. The Petsmart store itself was really clean and all the employees I encountered were polite and attentive. I wish the Petsmart near my house was just like this one. Too bad for me. But good for this store. 5 stars for you!"
"NC","Closed for business"
"NC","Closed, and has been for a long time now.  Last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more.  An average steakhouse."
"NC","A strip-mall chain.  It's not bad food, just a bad location.  Their version of a fried onion with dipping sauce is the same you'd get at Chilis.  The steak was cooked just as I ordered and the service was good.

This place is pretty much like a Longhorn or Outback, so if you like the two of those, give it a shot.

No complaints...just nothing special that's making me come back."
"NC","This is a chain and should be thought of as such! Not the best I have every had but, the service was excellent. You have to get there at about 5:00 or wait for okay food, in a store-front location."
"NC","This review is for the salon. I was looking to get my hair cut but no place could fit me in. I stopped by jcpenney where they made me an appointment with Chris. He was awesome. listened to what I wanted and gave me a great cut for under $40. I will definitely be back!"
"NC","I used the ship to store feature on the website to get free shipping since the mall is really close to my house. It was quick and easy, and definitely better than trying to fight people for product in the store. 

I didn't quite understand where I could pick up my order, so since it was shoes I walked to that section to ask. The girl at the front was really friendly and she called up to the receiving department who brought down my shoes. I checked to see that 1. it was the correct shoe and 2. that they were the correct size. Both were true, so she printed me a receipt, and I signed that I received the merchandise, then I was on my way! 

Very pleasant experience and definitely worth it to save $8."
"NC","After seeing myriad commercials and advertisements everywhere for the new JCP, I decided to pay them a visit.  It has been many, many, many years since I have even set foot in JCP.  I had not even given them a thought.  However, it is a new year and times have changed.  My visit netted quite a few items for my girls, not so much for myself.  Shopping on a Friday evening after work is, in fact, hard work.  The staff members were very nice and all of them greeted me cheerfully.

I ended up shopping online and found a couple items that I am quite pleased with.  I will say that many items were out of stock online; this is a clear indication that JCP has ramped up their merchandise quality and many haven taken notice and are reaping the benefits.  Shop JCP online to take your time viewing the merchandise.  If you are up to it, shop the store.  The 1st and 3rd Friday sales are on limited items that are on clearance."
"NC","JCPenney is not high fashion.  Indeed, most people would consider it to be mom fashion at best.  

Those people are not 6 and a half feet tall.

See, here's the thing: when you're as tall as I am, your options are limited.  Trendy stores don't sell clothes for you.  You're stuck with specialty (read expensive) shops, the internet (if it wasn't for this, I'd be naked), and a couple regular retailers that have a smattering of tall sizes.

JCPenney falls into this last category.  Their smattering is actually a lot bigger than most others' (that sounds gross).  The pants in their big and tall section are usually just big (50 x 29, I mean), but they have a reliable selection of tall shirts in reasonable girths.  Some of them are even pretty attractive.

The reason this store doesn't get a higher rating is that it's pretty unorganized.  You kind of have to wander all over the place to get what you want.  Chances are, however, that it's there.


Don't go out of business, JCPenney.  I need you."
"NC","It's been a while since I've been to JCPenney.  Probably a decade.  Seriously.  The only reason I went this time was because my mom sent me some clothes for Christmas, and, well, I didn't really care for them.  And keep the jokes about my mom dressing me to a minimum, please.  I was taking them back, thankyouverymuch.

There are three problems that I have with JCP - one is not really specific to this store, so I'll cover it first.

This is the only one anywhere near our house.  It's the only one in Charlotte (and it's actually in Pineville).  There was one in Eastland, but it closed some time back, after a brief experiment as an outlet.  It's just odd, but you can't really count that as a strike against this store - I just thought I'd mention it.

Second is the size of the place, and again, that's not really a fault here, as it is a department store.  What is a problem is the organization.  There isn't any.  Say you want to find something in the men's section - it's all over the place.  Finding anything is nearly impossible.

Lastly is the staff.  They are just about useless.  I took my return to a desk to see how much I had to work with (having only a gift receipt).  He told me $24.99.  So I found something for $24.99.  After returning to the same guy, he told me I owed nearly $9.  How is that possible?  He scanned the item's barcode, not the gift receipt - so I promptly made him figure it out - which should have involved changing the price of my item to the discounted price.  But it took him a while to figure that out.

I did get the discounted price, which is why I enjoyed the experience overall, and I probably shouldn't have - wouldn't have even expected it if he had scanned the right thing in the first place.  But it shouldn't have taken nearly that long.

The real reason I think it's worthwhile is that the prices (at least right now) are awfully good.  Lots of 50 and 60% discounts, so it's a good time to back up the truck."
"NC","Okay, we've all been to JC Penney at one point or another. I recently have been on the lookout for some drapes and heard they were having a huge sale so I wandered over. They have an enormous selection and, for someone who's never purchased drapes before, it can be extrememly overwhelming. I picked out the only set I liked, which of course, didn't come in the size I needed. I needed both 84 inch and 95 inch, and apparently 95 is hard to come by. I was about to throw in the towel and leave, but the sales associate came to my rescue and assured me that we could try to order them and I'd have them within the week. She held up the line in order to cater to me and called around searching for which other stores carried that size until she found it. As I was told, they came a day sooner than she promised. If you need drapery, go to JC Penney - they will go above and beyond for you!"
"NC","Waiting in line no one here....3 employees standing around and no one says anything. Horrible service. Next time ill just order on amazon"
"NC","Bought an item from there, didn't notice it was an open item until i checked out. Took it back 5 days later because one of the buttons didn't work, and they refuse to take it back claiming i dropped and damaged it. I never dropped it, i brought it back to them in the same condition they sold it to me as.  Then the manager told me we would not have sold one in the condition. But they sure sold it to me. BUYER BEWARE."
"NC","Great door greeter! 
Store pickup was fast courteous and professional. 
Checking out at the exit very impressed how Christian spoke spanish to the customer in front then English to us. ..to find out he speaks several lamguages! 
Not a rude or discourteous person in the visit!"
"NC","Good service here. I was greeted upon entering and thanked when exiting. I wanted to see what the deal was with the Samsung Gear. The sales associate in the department was knowledgeable about the product and could answer my questions."
"NC","Finding myself in need of a wireless router soon (going from AT&T U-Verse back to TWC because of moving - AT&T supplies wireless router, TWC charges you $15/mo. !?)., after a stop at The Home Depot located in the same shopping center, across from Carolina Place Mall, I thought I would check out Best Buy and see if they had what I needed.

I am typically an amazon girl, and I avoid going places to shop if at all possible (even though my job is the design of big box retailers).  This stop was more of a ""it's a pretty nice day out, I need to walk off lunch, oh look, there's Best Buy"".   

Upon walking into the store (clean, typical Best Buy footprint), there was a young lady in the middle of the aisle who appeared to be there to help direct traffic.  I said ""wireless router?"", she pointed and said ""computers are straight back"", so straight back I went.  As I know what a router looks like, I wandered the aisles until I found them, it only took a second.  There were a few employees in the computer section, but I didn't necessarily need assistance so I just started to look at prices and read boxes.  I had done some research online and pretty much knew what I was looking for.  Once I found the Netgear router, and saw the price, I used my handy dandy amazon price check app on my phone to compare and found that the router was the same price on amazon as it was at Best Buy.  SOLD!  I randomly ran the price check on the 2 ""better"" models of the router that I had in my hand and found the prices to be exactly the same as amazon.  Competitive pricing is what it's all about.  

For a Sunday just after church, they were well enough staffed.  I walked straight up to a young lady at the checkout who was friendly and efficient and I chit-chatted with her as I dug through my wallet looking for my debit card.   I have very limited patience for shopping, so this visit was a great experience."
"NC","Absolutely horrible customer service!  The worst Best Buy I have ever visited.  My family shops at Best Buy from Wilmington to Johnson City and this is by far the worst place we have ever been.  I don't usually write these but they irratated me to no end not once, not twice but three times.  It started last year when I purchased a new laptop to replace my 4 yr old one (which I also bought at Best Buy).  The Geek squad did not listen to my concerns and wiped my old laptop clean WITHOUT contacting me as they stated they would.  I lost a lot of important information!  Then stating that both my computers were ready (while contacting the wrong person over and over again).  When we went to pick them up they were not ready, and this happened 3 times.  Back and forth a total waste of time. THEN guess what happens a year later, THE SAME THING!! After having to wait for 45 mins for them to even find me in their system (I had spent the extra money on the one year plan-which they magically couldn't find 6 months later).  Still no contact to pick up my computer 7 days later, after they stated it was ready and guess what happened after i drove out of my way, it wasn't! Their response ""Oh, huh I don't know what happened there!"" not even an apology. Called again 3 days later to check and oh all of a sudden it was ready just that second.  Only to find out that it wasn't installed properly BY THE GEEK SQUAD to begin with which is why it messed up. Total lack of respect for customers and total idiots that obviously cannot read directions and dial a phone number correctly!"
"NC","Best Buy big box. Best display of electronics and appliances possible, this store is just like the rest. Enter and be confronted by racks of CD's and DVD's. Televisions on one side, Geek Squad on the other. Home appliances (refrigerators, washing machines and other small devices) on one side, computers and small electrics in the back. My friend needed a refill cartridge for his inkjet printer and Best Buy can be counted on to have a decent supply. A decent price? Not so much."
"NC","This is a good size BestBuy store in the area.  Normally I go to the one in Matthews that was the former circuit city location and it is a bit tighter.  I did notice that I did not get greeted by the security guy at the front as I normally do in Matthews - but that's a trivial part of the shopping experience [but I did notice it].

The guy manning the video game aisles was pretty knowledgeable and answered my questions well.  We also ended up spending a lot of time playing around with the Kinect demo in the store since my cousin could not make up his mind to make a big purchase or not.  I am the same way, but when it comes down to it, I usually just grab and go.  Buyers remorse sets in later, but I think the key rule is to go home and enjoy your purchase - don't go shopping anywhere else where the potential to see a lower price is pretty high.  Sometimes that does happen a lot with bestbuy stuf (I find). 

The Apple section of this store is pretty impressive too.  Very, very shiny and makes you want to buy stuff that you can't afford without taking a small loan out."
"NC","I would not recommend going to this Best Buy location. I recently purchased a big screen tv there and had the worst experience a consumer could have. I originally found a tv at their Rivergate location and they did not have any in stock so I went to Pinevill. When I arrived I was one of maybe four people in the store and no one would assist me. After waiting for twenty minutes I went to customer service where I waited another five minutes. Then customer service wouldnt help me. I knew the tv, model number and every other information and they still would not help. So they said they had to page  someone. After waiting another five to ten minutes someone finally came. Lets put it this way..... he treated me like I cut his break short or whatever he was doing out back. He barely said only one word to me, put the tv in the computer, rang me up and thats it. The only time he was slightly pleasant was when he tried to upsell me and I politely said no thank you. Then he went back to his original way. He handed me a receipt and said go up front to the guy in the blue shirt, and walked away. No thank you or thanks for you patience. So i went up front and waited for another few minutes for help. The guy from up front arrived, gave him my receipt and then waited another 20 minutes for the tv. Guess who brought it out.... the original guy. He put the tv in my truck turned around and walked away. Again, no thank you, have a nice day, nothing..... My question is if he walked away from me as soon as I purchased it and went to the back, why did it take 20 minutes to get the tv. He knew the guy in the front would be calling it in. I also am baffled  in this economy a consumer who is buying an expensive product at a store is not even mildly appreciated. I am the last one to usually complain about service because we all have our bad days but this store in whole must of had a bad day. I really have to blame it on management. I seriously had to bite my tongue on this one. The Rivergate location was wonderful however, they just unfortunately did not have the tv I wanted in stock."
"NC","I would definitely need some bad service for a bagel place to get less than four stars from me. Bruegger's has always been my go to bagel chain. Wow...did I just say I have a ""go to bagel chain""? Dang...I guess I did. 

The bagels are fresh, the coffee is better than average and you can get less bagel (skinny) for fewer calories. Who am I kidding, who eats bagels with cream cheese if they're counting calories?

The service at Bruegger's has always been good and the food has always been consistent.


Try: The sun dried tomato bagel with plain cream cheese

Avoid: The fortified brick foundation bagel (like you went to Bruegger's for health food!)"
"NC","I came here for the first time and was so happy they could customize my bagel to be healthy by making it skinny (cutting a chunk out of the middle making it thinner) and using egg whites.  It was warm, fresh and tasty.

Next I thought I would try one of their Green Mountain coffees - the Island Coconut flavor.  I know what your thinking but stop right there .... give it a whirl.  Wow it is good!  I got so excited about it I craved it for a whole week.

Its such a nice change to a greasy fried breakfast.  I'm glad I went and I will be back!"
"NC","In the Pineville area and need a quick breakfast meeting meal for the office? Here you go! Call ahead and within 15 minutes, your dozen bagels (sliced) and Box of Coffee is ready to go. Comes with 2 cream cheeses and the staff was very friendly about the order. Sometimes places, during breakfast, get irritated with large orders like this...not here. The place was busy and they were very helpful. The inside was larger than expected too!"
"NC","I have mixed feelings about Bruegger's but I still keep coming back here, quite regularly in fact.

Favorite thing about Bruegger's? The Jalepeno Cheese speciaty bagel. Yummy, chewy, cheesey, and spicy... all at once! Sometimes I get it with just cream cheese, sometimes as a breakfast bagel with egg. But usually I get it with hummus, veggie cream cheese, and lotsa fresh veggies.

Worst thing about Bruegger's? I think it's over priced. The hummus sandwich mentioned above it around $5. It just seems like a lot for what It is. They actually used to have this sandwich as a menu item back in the day, but now I have to itemize it and I guess that's what jacks up the price.

I know it's a fast food of sorts, but most of the employees here are young airheads who look at me like I'm crazy when I ask for hummus (because maybe no one else orders it?) Give me a big smile, courtesey and a little enthusiasm when you're taking my hard earned money... please?

Oh, and the decor/cleanliness could use a little UMPH."
"NC","Cream cheese skimp alert!! We pay ~$7 per smoked salmon bagel and they put the cream cheese on like people butter their toast. They have no clue what the word ""toasted"" means. It really is just warming the bagel. The lox bagels are not even made open face. Not going back again."
"NC","Great bagles and great ciabatta! We had one of the breakfast bagles with bacon, one with salmon, one specialty bagel and a chicken-pesto ciabatta. All is made to order and 100% fresh! We loved it! But keep in mind, that the quality makes it a little bit more expensive ;-)"
"NC","Brueggers Bagels when hot and fresh the bagel are good. I don't like the fact that they ask if you want the bagel toasted that is already hot or warm. Being from Jersey this is not a question asked in the early morning hours by any of the bagel shops. They really rip you off with their drink prices so grab a water at the gas station and save a buck."
"NC","Admittedly, the grump factor is high in some of my Yelp reviews.  In my defense, that's because my priority when reading others' reviews is to take note of the bad places and avoid them and I try to return the favor.

That said, I'm happy to click five stars for this location and would give them a sixth if I could.  Unfailingly helpful, polite, friendly and efficient, the crew lineup at this store has been remarkably stable - it makes one confident of getting the same excellent product and service regardless of the day of the week and despite the brutal early morning hours including weekends.  They are never shorthanded.

The bagels themselves are unmatched in the local market and in the Bruegger's chain overall.  The whole 'thank you baker' routine is a bit contrived but this one deserves the gratitude from staff and customers alike.

I'm not crazy about have to stand in a queue to get a quick bag of bagels and a to-go coffee waiting for others to place intricate eat-in orders but that's generally a problem only on the weekends.

This location has the self-serve coffee bar which also saves time and headaches for all.

I'm roughly equidistant from a few Bruegger's locations.  I occasionally visit other locations and am consistently disappointed, especially in the Park Road store (see other review). I'm a slow learner, I suppose, but grateful that one location does it right."
"NC","This place is an awesome!

The bagels are fresh, hot and delicious! I've tried several flavors including whole wheat, sesame and asiago cheese but my favorite by far is the everything bagel! It's delicious with so many different flavors!

They have a great combo option which includes a bagel sandwich and either soup or a salad and some chips. It's a great deal for only $6.99.

Also, great news is that on Wednesdays they have a Baker's dozen for $5.99 and that's a great deal for 13 bagels!

The employees are friendly and the food is great and its a great option for breakfast or lunch!"
"NC","My toes look GREAT, the staff is super nice! This is my first visit....I decided to join my friend (it's her Birthday) Personally I only visit nail salons that use Tub liners, which this place doesn't....so my search will continue."
"NC","BEST NAIL EXPERIENCE EVER!!! With nail salons, I usually experience friendly, but not great work or excellent work and not too friendly or a little bit of both , but not a great atmosphere! This encompassed all 3! The paraffin (no extra charge), large massage chair, very attentive and detailed pedicure, affordable pricing  and the exceptionally friendly service made the experience 5 stars! This will be the only salon I use for for mani, pedi and waxing. A little bit hard to find (across from Carolina place mall on 51, in the K-mart/Best Buy strip mall).. GO NOW!"
"NC","Great value. I think this will become a regular place for me. Rebecca was great! I loved the long massage, and paraffin wax treatment, which I never got in any swanky Ballantyne/Southpark basic pedi that costs $20 more. The place is not fancy, but their service is outstanding. My one small complaint was that the chair was well-used and maybe not the most comfortable, but the massage feature worked just fine!"
"NC","I recently moved to Charlotte and I was looking for a nail salon to get a mani and pedi. I'm so happy I stopped at Lefi. I loved, loved the manicure and pedicure they gave me. They took their time and gave me the longest and best massages. The also add paraffin to their pedicure for no extra charge. I will definitely recommend this place, not only they give great service but they are super friendly."
"NC","First time visiting this mall and it definitely has a good spread of shopping and food. We weren't on a mission to purchase anything so we were just walking around but it was clean, bright and buzzing with activity."
"NC","Very typically mall experience.  It's big and busy and everything was crowded before Christmas.  It's clean and well lit.  The parking lots are as convenient as they can be.  Nothing stood out to me, either good or bad... so three stars... a-ok."
"NC","Love shopping at this mall.... Very affordable especially during the holiday season! Just be careful shopping on the weekends! It can get VERY crazy!!!!!"
"NC","Nice clean mall inside and out.
Food court is lacking in options. If you don't work at the mall you wouldn't eat at the mall. 
Good store options available but could use different variety...lots of sports ones.
Hair cutters places?
Good location easy to get in and out with lots of directions."
"NC","Gave this mall yet another try again today, disappointed again.  Easily second fiddle to any other mall in the area.  All the regular stores, plus some of the more trashy ones.  And watch out for the security nazis, same jerk came by twice in 6 min to tell my 3 kids to calm down, and we were outside the mall!?!  I figured outside was the best place for my kids to run & play while we waited for the stores to open.  Will continue to go to SouthPark of all my mall needs."
"NC","I'm a mall fanatic and shopaholic, and while visiting a friend in the area I said I was having mall withdrawals and he brought me to this one!

Very nice mall and I'm used to the Boston area malls, very crowded, but it was a dreary Saturday afternoon, so there probably wasn't much else to do that day. Stores were pretty much the same as where I'm from with the exception of Dillards and Belk which I hadn't been to in a long time.

The food court had more of a variety than I'm used to, long lines at every restaurant, but like I said, it was a Saturday afternoon! 

The Barnes and Noble was awesome, huge store, comfortable with lots of variety, I loved the Hallmark store, lots of different gift items which would be great at Christmastime. Spent forever in Yankee Candle, people probably thought I'd never been in one before, but it happens to be one of my favorite addictions, I mean, stores! 

Great mall to walk around in, huge variety, 2 levels of shops and restaurants. Would go back again on my next visit, but I hear theres a mall with Valet parking in Charlotte, so may try that one out next time!"
"NC","What to do on Christmas Eve eve... oh, Carolina Place Mall is open 'til 11pm? Let's go wander around there and watch the masses scramble for gifts.

When I need to make a mall trip, this is not at the top of the list for me. I rank Northlake, SouthPark and Concord all above it. One: anything that involves 485 does not make me pleasant. Two: The store selection here is just kind of meh. Three: it's a pain to get in and out of this place.

Now I will say this, there is an H&M on the way which could be a game changer for this place. It will be great for people on the south side of town since currently there is just the one location up at Northlake. Until SouthPark gets one, this one will do for our side of town.

Typical anchor stores here. I don't want to say that it feels outdated... I don't think that's the right description. Maybe old school vibe is more accurate.

If I'm near this area and need a mall, I'll venture here. But with so many better options in the Charlotte area, it's definitely not a must-go shopping destination on my list."
"NC","Santa Claus here sucks!  They wouldn't even give us a couple minutes to settle our child down.  They just shooed us along and wouldn't even try to help calm our kid down.  

How disappointing it is that these people are charging an arm and leg for these pictures but will not even attempt to settle a child down or get them acclimated to a stranger with a long beard! 


I will not be back to see year people again!

I"
"NC","This is an interesting mall for me. From the outside it looks nice. The grounds are well kept and everything seems to be in good repair. Same with the interior.

The first thing I don't get here is that there are FIVE department stores here. For whatever reason Americans love their department stores I guess. You don't see malls in Canada with more than two department stores and even then Sears is struggling.

The other thing about this mall that is odd is that the large majority of clothing stores located here are sportswear stores. If you were blindfolded and taken here you would think Charlotte is full of people who only wear hoodies, basketball shorts, and Nikes.

Aside from the sportswear there is your standard chain store offering like Aeropostale, Victoria's Secret, and XXI. There's a couple of restaurants attached to the mall and also a few out in the parking lot. The food court has a handful of options including a froyo place, McDonalds, and Chick-fil-a."
"NC","This mall is huge! In the mall or in the immediate area are JC Penny, Macy's, Dillards, HotTopic, Belk, Sears, REI, Toys R Us, Garden Ridge, and more! Looking for food? Plenty of options: Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Buca de Peppo, and more. 

The glass ceiling allows a lot of natural light to get into the mall which gives the feel of an open-air mall, even though it's enclosed. There are two floors with many junctions with stairs and escalators and elevators. 

This is a great one-stop shop for an individual, a couple, or a family - there's something for everyone. 

There are plenty of areas to park around the mall, but like any mall, it may take you a while driving around to find a space during busy times (weekends, holidays, etc.)"
"NC","Just your typical mall.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  It was kept pretty clean as well and had a large amount of parking."
"NC","Good selection of stores catering to the mostly middle class shopper.  No high end stores here. If you want pricey head to South Park.

Love this mall and the food court is awesome, too.  Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Buca de Peppo, and Applebees are located just outside the mall in the parking area."
"NC","I have lived in Charlotte since before Carolina Place opened and it was a welcome addition to the area.  It started to dip a little in quality for a bit, but seems to be picking up some steam again.

It can be a terror to get in and out of during the holidays, as all shopping centers are, but even on most busy weekends you can survive a trip for shopping with minimal damage to your body or car.  Your typical southern mall anchors are located here - Belk, Dillard's JCPenney, Sears, Macy's.  My usual store trips are Lane Bryant, Yankee Candle and Bath & Body Works.  Maybe the Hallmark store, probably Auntie Ann's.  Belk was recently renovated and the Lane Bryant is a full store plus it took over the store next to it, so the lingerie/sleep section is huge.  The attached REI is nice and the Barnes & Noble is huge.

My teenage years of stalking the mall are WAY behind me, so I get what I need and get out rather than window shopping for hours so I can't speak as to the crowds.  If I am there around feeding time, the food court has some great choices including Chick Fil A and Sbarro.  Or if a more sit down and relax outside of the shopping center experience is what you need, there is a Harper's attached that provides some excellent food."
"NC","Carolina Place is a great drive from my house and the proximity is something that makes it stand out. It's not an upscale mall like South Park by any means, but if you want a good bargain you should come here to find it. 

They have a good selection of stores including Belk, JC Penny, Macy's and Dillards, as well as Bath and Body Works, The Limited, and Forever 21. 

Recently they added a TCBY, which I thought was a great addition and seems to be very popular. The food court has your standard mall food, but my favorite is Chick - Fil - A."
"NC","You might be a shopaholic if:
- the people at the food court in your mall have given you the employee discount because they honestly believe you work there

Oh, well... Such is my life at CP... lol  I have been to a lot of malls... I would say every mall has a vibe... Some are snooty, others are dated and of course, we have the ""new"" malls...  I would say that shopping at CP is basically like hanging out with an old high school friend... You may not do it all the time, but when you get around to it, it's such a good time you wonder why you stopped... lol

I would suggest parking anywhere but the near the food court because that's always crowded... The Belk's entrance usually has decent spaces left or the upper level of Macy's would be a good bet... Speaking of which, the anchor stores are quality... In addition to those two, there's a Sears, JCP, Dillards, REI and a two story Barnes and Noble with a café and comfy chairs inside... There are quite a few new trendy stores for the young ladies (ie. Francesca's Collections, DEB) and the old standbys like Forever 21 and Wet Seal... The Hat Shack is great... They help me find all sorts of fitted caps for the boyfriend's gifts and are all knowledgeable about their wares... You can pick up your infomercial fix at At Seen on TV... The kiosk employees vary... Some people just play on their phones and watch you walk by... Others ask you an innocuous question like, ""Do you know what time it is?"" in an effort to draw you into the web once they have your attention... If you don't want to be bothered or you're in a hurry, walk on the outer edge of the walkway toward the store entrances... 

I will tell you to watch the sanitation grades in the food court... I'm just saying, I've seen some 90's and once an 87... That's just a little too close to ick for my comfort... lol You can't go wrong with the Chick-Fil-A there, though... Their scores are consistently high..."
"NC","I remember when this mall first opened and it was AWESOME.  Throughout the years it has gone a bit downhill, but it still serves a purpose of having some pretty cool specialty shops and all the major anchors (Belk, Macy's, JC Penney etc...).

I like to people watch so it's always interesting to see who is there from the EMO teen crowd to older mall walkers.  The Food Court has all of the standard mall places like Sbarro and the like.

Parking on the weekends may take you some time to find the ""perfect"" spot, but there is plenty of spots available.  The REI is a nice addition and I am always surprised that the Barnes and Noble is still in business (I LURVE AMAZON).

When I want a better shopping experience, I make the drive to Southpark, but when I have specific places to get in and get out of, I head over to Carolina Place."
"NC","It's an average mall with nothing to really brag about.  Has real anchor stores like Belks, Sears, JC Penny's, and Macy's and other various national mall stores.  The food court has a fine selection of places serving Bourbon Chicken.   There is a REI store on the backside of the mall, so that makes it more unique compared to the other malls in the area, but beyond that you are not going to find anything special here that you cannot find anywhere else.  No real crime or gang issues at this mall, too boring for that."
"NC","ALERT TO PARENTS AND SHOPPERS OF CAROLINA PLACE MALL:  One of the employees of the massage parlor (Oasis) next to the kid's play area was caught inconspicuously taking pictures of my 4 yr. old daughter while she was playing there.  Even though it is private property, the General Manager of the Carolina Place will not ban him from working at the mall because it is not against the law to take pictures of little girls.  The police report number is 121005-2147."
"NC","My favorite mall in the Queen City area. It has a down to earth vibe to it. A great mall because it's really never packed."
"NC","I love this mall!!

It's not overwhelming and always packed like Concord Mills and it has stores that everyone can shop in...like Belk and JC Penny's all of my other favorites stores like Bath and Body Works, NY and Company, Express...the list goes on and on...It's always clean and I rarely have trouble finding parking. Right off the highway which is a huge plus in my book but another reason this mall is so great is the location... it's surrounded by really good restaurants, like Harpers, Red Lobster, Olive Garden.

I'm really a fan and I would recommend my friends and family to this mall."
"NC","I only venture over to Carolina Place when I have gift cards for JC Penny and now that they've done away with all the good sales on kids clothing it's really not even worth the trip since the other stores are just regular mall stores.  Nothing special about Carolina Place unless you live close by, otherwise South Park is your best bet."
"NC","I am not a huge fan of malls and when I go, I want to get in and get out pretty quickly. Usually when I go to the mall, I am going to one of the big anchor stores, and once inside those, I generally find a pretty good selection at Carolina Place. There is plenty of parking but unfortunately, getting  out of the mall parking lot onto 51 or one of the other surrounding roads can be a bit of a hassle."
"NC","I hate malls! I wasn't a mallrat when I was a kid. I tend to avoid malls as much as possible Unfortunately, in a twist of fate, I was ""blessed"" with two girls who are about to hit mallrat stage. Oh bliss!

And this visit was 100% their fault. We hit all the ""cool"" stores like P.S. by Aeropostale, The Children's Place, Build-A-Bear, The Rack Room... I'm feeling nauseous...

Meh, it's a mall. Of all the malls in Charlotte this is the only one I'd ever really set foot in. It's very mall-like. It's not a narcissistic hellhole like Southpark, it's as generic as Northlake, it's not its own city like Concord Mills, it's not the arsehole of the world like Freedom (is that one still even there?). It's a mall."
"NC","Not the best or the worst mall in Charlotte. I'm the in and out type of guy - go straight to correct store, shop and get back to car/drive back home. In that perspective, Carolina Mall works.

For a fuller mall feel, I Concord Mills Mall and others better than this one."
"NC","The only really bad thing about Carolina Place is the location.  It is not anywhere near where my normal routine takes me, and so that means getting there is a bit of a chore.  To make matters worse, the traffic around the mall is horrible.  It is a shame, really, because the parking lot at the mall is one of the better ones in the city.

Selection in the mall is actually top-notch.  Not as far as pricing, mind you, but as far as regular-guy stores.  This is just your standard mall, and that is okay.  Even the outparcels are good - what is more is that they are almost always full.  The stores in the mall are generally occupied, the stores outside the mall are typically full, even the blocks (and blocks, and blocks) around the mall usually have someone in them.  It is actually quite impressive.

Go to Concord Mills and they have to build.  Here they just keep reusing old buildings, which is really nice to see.  Now it would be nice if they could take up a little of the space and create some decent infrastructure so traffic was not so bad all the time!"
"NC","I was here earlier today and I have to say every time I've gone there its always a nice experience. It never seems to be too packed and they actually have a very nice selection of stores. I always end up leaving with more than I intended on getting, but I think that's may just be the shopaholic in me. lol. I also like their food court, but other than that its your typical mall."
"NC","Probably not my first choice in malls, but it's alright.  Being in Charlotte for a while, I've seen this mall change through the years.

I definitely like the design of the subtle ""S"" shape of the mall, making it seem longer than it really is since you can't see end to end.

Parking around the food court can be a little scary, but I usually just try to get in and out really quick when I need to go here.  I did just recently go into the REI (which is fairly new) but it's really neat to go in a look around... I didn't realize it was 2 stories.  The other farily recent addition is the Barnes & Nobles.  Another good spot, but always busy."
"NC","I was pleasantly surprised with this mall. It's nicely decorated and has a spacious layout. Most of the mainline stores are here. It was very clean inside too.

I didn't spend much time here and I don't live nearby. It seems nice and I'd be happy to come here again when in the neighborhood!"
"NC","I agree with Garret G...it's not ghetto (Eastland) and it's not snooty (South Park). It's a little bit of a drive, but when I need to get my mall on, I usually head to Carolina Place as the baby-bear (just right) alternative for me.

There are some good restaurants in the area as well, including Buco di Beppo, and the food court is pretty nice. The indoor play area is also an asset when the little niece is visiting."
"NC","I used to go shopping here quite often with the parentals, but that was many years ago & now I only travel here for the stuff around it. The mall used to be the nice new place where people in & around the city traveled. But lately the mall has started slipping & just doesn't offer up as much as it used to be.

I do go to some places around the mall though, such as REI & Buca Di Beppo. This area used to be sparse with commerce, but it's built up a lot lately & they have some good options around the mall.

But if you're heading to Carolina Place for the mall aspect, don't expect anything spectacular. They have your normal stores like any other mall, so nothing special. But it's not a bad trip to check out the stores & restaurants around the mall."
"NC","I used to come here and eat the big slices of Sbarro pizza in the food court and just people watch.  Although I am not much of a mall person, I enjoy this mall more than any other in the Charlotte region because it isn't ghetto and it isn't snooty either, it is right in between.  I like the Newsstand to gaze at the Rolling Stone and I like Lids for my head accessories.  Carolina Place is really laid back."
"NC","Good service, small portions"
"NC","Had great service until we got our food. Took one bit into my pasta and a brillo pad was on my fork!!!! I was disgusted. I asked to speck to the manger and she told me "" it's acceptable for these kinds of things to happen in restaurants"". I will not be going to any restaurant if Brillo pads are going To end up in my food. Yes I know sometimes things could land I'm my food. I.e hair but a Brillo pad is something that can't go unseen. 
I contacted Applebee's human resources and they were great. No complaints there, very friendly and easy to work with, called back was very impressed."
"NC","I'm not a fan but I enjoy drinking at the bar area. So if you're coming to drink ... not so bad. If you're coming to eat ...  ah you might think again!"
"NC","My intention was to get back to Sweet Tea's today, but they are closed on Sundays. So, being in that area, my Mother wanted the Chinese Chicken Salad at Applebee's, one of her all time favorites. Not being a true fan of chains, I agreed. And, I was very impressed. I ordered a cheeseburger w/ fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and fresh! I also really enjoyed their seasoned fries. My Mom enjoyed her salad as well, and the staff was attentive throughout the entire meal. Shocked, yes, but happy I said yes."
"NC","Service sets the tone for a meal! It has been my experience that even when the food is ok, the service can ruin the meal and experience! 

That being said my coworker and I stopped into Applebee's for the Pick n' Pair lunch special. The hostess sat us at our table with no greeting and lucky for us she was our waitress as well...sarcasm intended and required. 

She took our drink order walked away several minutes later she returned with our drinks...asked if we knew what we wanted to eat and we placed our ordered. I chose the Fiesta Chicken Chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup. 

Now, I don't know how long it takes to put soup in the bowl and throw some salad on a plate but with maybe two other tables occupied and it being late in the afternoon it certainly doesn't take half my lunch hour. And for those of us who try to leave the office for some peace of mind and freedom during the workday...when you are on your lunch hour every moment counts.

When our food finally arrived with the few moments we had left on a lunch break. I scarfed it down I think it tasted ok. From what I remember, the salad was spicy and the jalapeno dressing was yummy! The chicken tortilla soup was just ok. It could have used a few more pieces of chicken and spice to take it up a notch. 

Overall, the experience was horrible. The service was horrible. The food was ok. I won't be running back to this location any time soon."
"NC","I really wanted some Red Lobster that night, but I guess everyone else did, too... We were near Carolina Place Mall and the Olive Garden next door looked just as packed... I figured Applebee's would be uncrowded and a decent choice for food since it had been quite a while since I'd been there... It was just what I expected... The server was nice, the food was good and the prices were reasonable...  The only things that could be improved were the lukewarm temperature of the cheese that came out with the new beer pretzels (which were awesome) and the riblets I ordered were just a bit fatty...  My boyfriend's new shrimp pasta with queso was great... Overall, a solid showing from good ol' Applebee's..."
"NC","I cannot believe I have been to Applebee's twice in one week.  This place has been recently renovated and although is a smaller Applebee's, it is open and has a nice friendly feel.  Wait staff very nice and helpful."
"NC","Absolutely the worst customer service of any retail store I've ever experienced. No matter what city/state, it never fails."
"NC","While I don't mill about in Dillard's (I am a Belk girl), when Clinique has their free-gift-with-purchase bonus time at Dillard's, I stop in to refill on stuff to make meh purty and smell good and get a free bag of items to try (there are few things in this world that ruin my day quite like spending $50 on a moisturizer that either breaks me out or feels like grease).  On a Sunday at 1:00 pm (but the day before Labor Day), there weren't very many people milling about, but it was kind of early.  

Getting straight to the Clinique counter (on the second floor), I was greeted by a very friendly young woman who quickly located the night moisturizer that I wanted and asked me what color group of gift I wanted.  She was very friendly and informative (I didn't catch her name, unfortunately, I was still terrified from my 485 construction traffic trip).  I was $50 poorer and on my way in no time. 

While strolling back through the men's department to the parking lot, I noticed a jaunty plaid Ralph Lauren golf cap that was on clearance that I decided my dad needed to have.   I don't think the young lady that checked me out had enough coffee yet (she seemed less than thrilled that I interrupted her conversation with a coworker), but whatevs - she was polite enough and I was on my way.

Dillard's seems a little dated and like it could use a facelift and some new lighting.  I don't think they have done anything with this store since it opened 20+ years ago.  That is not to say the merchandise isn't up-to-date, it is... the store just seems a little wearier than the Belk (which was recently remodeled) or the brighter Macy's."
"NC","Dillard's is pretty nice but their decor seem a bit outdated though, probably because of their lighting, however, they do offer great variety of brands of clothings. And they do have good sales most of the time. Sad part is they don't offer any other form of discounts, like Belk or Macy. But Dillard's is still a great place to shop at."
"NC","I like this Dillard's because it is easy to get in and out of.  I also have found quite a few good deals on sale items at this store.  On my last couple of shopping trips here, I have found the employees to be helpful and friendly."
"NC","If you are heading to Carolina Place, this is the entrance I choose. 

The parking is adequate, you do not have to worry about trying to beat the other crazy shopper for that one last parking spot in front of the food court,  and since it is at the end of the mall, I could always use the extra exercise. Afterall, I am eating at all these places I am Yelping about, and appear to be yelping on myself in the meantime.

Now, back to Dillard's, It is a staple to Charlotte, and is a viable competitor to Belk's,  Macy's and dare I say Nordstrom's.

The Men's Dept is where I usually shop, (not saying that I shop in the Women's section) but I am at that crucial XXL vs. the Big & Fat (B&F) Selection. This does not have the (B&F) area like Southpark, and I usually find a few better deals at the Dillard's Southpark Store in the B&F Section.  No offense to big people.....I wear a 3XL.

With that being said, the shoe selection is nice, although my last Timberland's only made it three months......(must be all the footwork to the Yelping), but they do have a nice variety and the prices are reasonable.

The staff is friendly, and just an FYI, ever time I go there, I see the Pineville Police doing security, so you can feel much safer than at any other mall.

"NC","I went in here to get my engagement ring resized.  I was so upset on the possibility of giving my ring over to strangers and the possibility of not seeing it for a while!  The staff was wonderful, and even through computer difficulties, they were really nice.  The reasoning for my two star review is for one detail of my experience here.  

My fiance purchased this ring, as a surprise.  Clearly, I was never meant to know the price of this ring.  Maybe some people go pick out rings together, but I feel like mostly, grooms are picking these out for a surprise or gift etc...Well in order to get my specific ring resized they had to send it off and get an entirely different ring.  The same style etc, just a different ring that fit.  The cashier printed out the reciept and gave me a copy.  I felt very uncomfortable knowing the amount of my engagement ring and thought it to be a little classless.  Maybe this is a common practice that I am unaware of, but I did not like it.  I did enjoy the politeness and courtesy staff and overall thought this store had a great selection of products. Just a bit uncomfortable to see how much someone spent on an engagement ring!"
"NC","We decided to start our wedding band search for both Kevin and me and this was the first jeweler we stopped at.  Gary approached us asking what we were looking for, and I told him both rings.  He showed me a few of the rings that might look good with my ring, and there was one that I liked.  He asked if he could write it up for puchase, I said no, we were just starting our search and wanted to see what was out there.  We then asked him about the men's rings, and pointed us over to men's, not showing us or giving us information on rings.  So we were back on our own.

We spent a few moments looking at the men's wedding bands when we were approached by another sales person, but we turned them away just saying we were looking.  Shortly after, another lady comes over.  Kevin didn't want the help, but I asked her anyways.  Amber was a huge delight.  She showed us the different kinds of rings and tolds us the different information on the rings.  She asked us if we wanted her to write down the information on a card so we would know which ones we were interested in.  She even went back to mine to write that down, and showed me another ring she thought would match, and it did, better than the one Gary showed us!  She was happy to help us and very friendly, even though we were just looking.  She was really the one that helped us moving forward and knowing what we wanted to look for at all the other stores.

One star for Gary and five for Amber.  We are not going to go back to purchase because we found ones that we loved more at another store and that were more for our budget."
"NC","I don't know of any other jeweler with a loyalty or marketing program like Helzberg. My husband bought me a ring for graduation a couple years ago and some jewelry on special occasions from Helzberg. Since those purchases, his name has been on their list and for our anniversary and my birthday, they have sent us cards with a free gift (have to go to store to pick up). Talk about speaking my love language! This is definitely a relationship with benefits!

We've been into this particular location a few times and each time we have been met by friendly sales associates. They haven't ever pressured us to buy anything and believe me I have been known to ""window shop"" the jewelry cases planning my next big purchase. 

I've purchased other significant pieces of jewelry (e.g., husband's wedding band) at other high end jewelers and I've never received a card from them...they should take note of Helzberg and follow suit. Definitely when it comes to customer service and above-and-beyond satisfaction, Helzberg has it down!"
"NC","This Olive Garden was very clean, the staff was very professional and quick and the food was delicious! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. He never let our drinks go down half way and he was very punctual and respectful."
"NC","We arrived and were seated at the same time as a big party, but our service never lacked.  The food is just what you expect from a chain Italian spot.  I tried the tortellini small plate and it was really good and super rich.  The small plate is just enough.  

No complaints here..."
"NC","Everything pasta ! BuonAppetito ! So our first impression was we would be here awhile since parking was full. Surprisingly enough we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our sever was prompt and informative and our first course arrived on our table less than 8 minutes from the time we ordered it! 
The salad had only one complaint and it seems to be a consistent issue with this restaurant - one that really doesn't make sense to me - olives ! There are two olives in the large bowl of salad ... If you want more than two olives, you have to ask for them - which is strange since their very name boasts of them ! Have found this to be the case each to time I've eaten here. 
Spaghetti & meat sauce was my meal and it
 was yummy.  Hubs had seafood Alfredo . He said he wouldn't recommend it again but it was just okay. 

Tiramsu was delicious and the coffee was fresh and piping hot !
No complaints other than the olive shortage ..."
"NC","Smells like wet dog.  EXTREMELY humid inside.   Food was good (the two stars worth).  Service was very bad today.  I am a server myself and I would be beyond embarrassed if I provided such poor service to a table.  Added bonus - It constantly seemed like she was trying to rush us out.  Delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking!!!  Also delivered our checks before we were halfway done and we had to ask to have a desert added on..."
"NC","MY WAITRESS WAS AMAZING!!! Her name was ALLYSON. I would ask for her if you have the opportunity and she was the waitress on shift. 

This definitely started off as a bad experience. We called at 5:50pm and told them we wanted to come in around 6:30pm and wanted to make a reservation for 6. The hostess on the phone informed me that there was no need to call ahead. We again mentioned that it is a party of 6. She said they are so slow that we don't need it. OKAY!

We get to the parking lot at 6:30pm and it is packed!!!!! We were a little confused because what we were told earlier. Once we got inside we were told we would have a 40 minute wait. I was pissed because the lady on the phone insisted that we do not need a reservation and here we are stuck waiting. We wanted to talk to the manager, who never came. However after 5 minutes a party of 7 failed to show up and we were given their table. This made sense, we appreciated it.

Thereafter, we did the endless pasta for 9 bucks and the soup/salads. Its an olive garden. The food was really good it was nice and warm so thats always a plus. The breadsticks were extremely fresh and flavorful among the best I had. The waitress was attentive but not to much! Our drinks and food were prompt, she came around enough, extremely nice. She made the experience that began negatively a whole lot better. Had we had a horrible waitress the place would have gotten maybe 2 stars.

ALLYSON IS AMAZING =] truly a pleasure!"
"NC","The food today was all good ..we had chicken Alfredo ,kids ravioli , the new wings , risotto balls and the soup and salad , they were all tasty I really enjoyed the wings. The service was however pretty terrible the appetizers arrived after our meal we think they forgot that part of the order . the bread sticks showed up finally as we were done . I will say the manager did give us the appetizers for free without us ever having to complain so that was a plus .."
"NC","--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! 

This is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served. 

Management provided a friendly compensation, but I don't want anyone to get poisoned, sooo yeah, eat at your own risk!!"
"NC","From the time we walked in to the time we left the staff was extremely friendly. The new ""small plates"" are a great addition to an already great menu selection. Try the crispy asparagus!!! Only 2.99 to add to an entree. My wife had the steak Gorgonzola and it was cooked a perfect medium. All in all I felt like it could not have been a better dinner date night!"
"NC","It's Olive Garden... So of course I'm not going to give 4-5 stars. Friendly service, prompt wait staff, drinks come fast and the $11.99 3-course meal going on now is a pretty darn good deal."
"NC","This place was disgusting!!! I ate here yesterday around 6. I usually love Olive Garden but the last 2times I've been here was nasty. The outside is dirty, front entrance littered with cigarette butts. There is a stinch as soon as you open the door. The food was gross, greasy and very bad. I gave it one star because of the waiter.  I'll never go to this one ever again. The health inspector needs to visit and manager fired!!"
"NC","It is amazing how this restaurant always has long wait times when I honesty don't believe that the food is great. I have gone a couple of times and each time that I have gone I have gotten different dishes. I feel like the food is not flavorful and are always missing something. You can definitely find better chain Italian restaurants like Maggiano's or Bravo! Come here if you like bland dishes."
"NC","i know, I know--Olive Garden, how pedestrian of me! I don't have too many chain restaurant reviews, so I figured I'd write one. We went for a surprise birthday party. My friend had made a reservation which they somehow didn't have (maybe she called the wrong one? Anyway, I'm not going to dock for this). The staff was very accommodating, they were able to put a table together for us on short notice. 

When we sat down, I was immediately hit by a gross smell. I asked my friend ""Do you smell that? It smells like..."" to which he replied ""wet dog!"" which is exactly what I was thinking. It smelled badly like wet dog. How disgusting. Maybe it was the table--can you say dirty rags? While we waited for the rest to arrive, we got breadsticks and were also told that dessert for the birthday would be a charge. Really? Come on now. The bread sticks were pretty underwhelming--there was no garlic or flavor really. Booo. 

Once everyone arrived, we placed orders. I got the Bruschetta Salmon. When I asked the waiter how it was, he said he hadn't tried it in forever but that people say it's decent--I appreciated that honesty! They served salad shortly     My goodness this place was slow though. The food took forever. When it came out, it was pretty lousy. I found two bones in the salmon before I quit eating it. The risotto pasta thing under it was so heavy and the salmon was sort of hard and the toppings made no sense. It felt like two or three dishes in one. Others' food didn't come out, so the manager came out and apologized and comped several meals. He even went up to the birthday boy and told him he'd comp his dessert as well. Thumbs up. 

Dessert was actually pretty good--I got the chocolate tuxedo mousse cake which was quite good and it seems everyone else enjoyed theirs as well. The only reason this place is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is for service. Our waiter was personable and friendly, and the manager was excellent. I'd stay away from this garden like the plague, though."
"NC","Popped in for a take out order on a very busy Sunday afternoon. I don't know why the OG gets so busy on family holidays like Mother's Day, but on this one it was packed solid with people waiting outside, inside and in the bar area.

We were able to place our to go order with the very busy takeout manager. That guy should get five stars. But the rest of the place, not so much. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting to place the order and then waiting for it. Could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink? Maybe offered a glass of water? Nope.

The food was OG standard but again it was packed perfectly with the salad in an interesting container that kept the lettuce and such fresh with the dressing and croutons separate. They also put a separator to keep the cold stuff from affecting the hot stuff.

Two stars because the place was less than tidy and the bar staff didn't seem interested in customers. Otherwise, it would have been pretty good."
"NC","This is probably one of the worst Olive Garden I have been to. I am a frequent diner at Olive Garden, but had my first experience with this particular one last week. My server was horrific. Being a previous server myself, I can understand the pressures and stress on a busy night. However, this server was completely inattentive and was rushing my friend and I the entire time. Our salads came not even five minutes before our food was sent out. I am completely disappointed. I don't recommend this location to anyone."
"NC","Went here on Sunday. We don't usually go to chain restaurants, simply because there are so many delicious locally owned restaurants in the area. However, we had a gift card and decided to go have dinner. 

We got there around 6 and had no wait for a table. However, when we left, there was alot of people in the lobby waiting for a seat.

We both ordered a glass of the house red. Well priced and very good for a house wine.

I ordered the soup and salad with the pasta fagoli soup. My husband ordered the lasagna primavera from the lighter side part of the menu (it had spinach and veggies in it).

Breadsticks and salad came out like expected. The breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more. The soup was very good and my husbands lasagna was even better. However, we were joking that there is no wonder that the lasagna was on the lighter side. It was so small!! I guess we should have expected that, given that making lasagna ""light"" isn't an easy task. I can't even begin to explain to you how small it was......AND normally we normally split meals at restaurants, so we are typically used to smaller portions to begin with! Probably the size of half a deck of cards (width, length, and height) with like 3 small pieces of grilled chicken on it. He ate it and didn't complain....it was tasty, though!

Normally we skip dessert but when the waitress came by, my husband ordered the pumpkin cheesecake (not sure if it was because he was still hungry or just craving something sweet!). This was SO good. HUGE slice of cheesecake. Very tasty and that slice was gone in like 5 minutes haha. 

Overall, ok experience, just wouldnt go back unless we had another gift card."
"NC","Until recently, I worked near the mall and a couple of weeks ago my wife and daughter decided to surprise me at work for a family lunch date and this OG was selected.  Biggest mistake ... ever.

The only positive part of the visit was the host/hostess station, who had their act together enough to seat us with minimal wait.  We then sat at the table for15 minutes before anyone resembling a waiter appeared.  When our waiter approached our table, he set down two menus and walked away without saying a single word or acknowledging us in any way.  We then waited another 10 minutes before he returned to take our drink AND meal order.

At this point, we were both upset but decided to give them a pass since it was a busy lunch rush on a Friday.  My wife and I both ordered coke and decided to get the all you can eat three pasta promotion and asked for our garlic bread and salad to be brought out before the meal.  

We then did not see our waiter again for 30 minutes when he appeared carrying our entire meal out on one tray - drinks and pasta - without salad or bread sticks.  We were visibly upset at this point, my lunch hour was now over, and we were just now getting our incomplete first round of our ""all you can eat"" order.

He literally put the food down on the edge of the table without asking us who had which dish and disappeared again.  My wife had ordered the fettuccine Alfredo for her first dish. I am not exaggerating when I say that what she was brought was a bowl of cold linguini noodles with a glubbed-on ball of cold Alfredo sauce sitting in the center on top of the noodles.

I never request to see the manager when the service is this poor because management is always the problem.  Incompetent management breeds the hiring of incompetent wait staff, so rather than make a scene I simply leave the restaurant.  If they care to stop me to try to insist I pay, well then game on.  No one stopped me.

I returned to work with an empty stomach and placed yet another restaurant on my black list.  And we never did receive our salad and bread.

Olive Garden - your food is not that good to begin with.  If you wish to stay in business, I suggest you visit stores for quality checks on a much more frequent basis - especially this location.  Just dreadfully awful.

Cheers!"
"NC","Let me start off by premising the fact that I was at the mall, I knew I could sit quickly at the bar and I had a gift card since christmas or I would not be eating at a chain restaurant. It was what you expect at all of the chains. I got chicken and shrimp carbonarra (spell check). It was fair. What does one expect for something quick and convenient to what I was doing at the time.  I do wish however that I spent the gift card next door just shoveling cheddar bays down my throat. Good talk."
"NC","I love this place because the pasta is always very very very hot."
"NC","I do agree with most of the reviews that OG isn't in my top 10 places that I care to dine.  As this location is directly in front of Carolina Place mall (right next to a Red Lobster), there is ALWAYS a wait at peak times, and on the weekends, fuggedaboudit.  I was making a trip to the mall and thought some salad and bread sticks would properly fuel me for a shopping battle.

I arrived right around 5:30 on a Monday, so there was no wait then, but as I was dining, the place began to fill.  I was promptly greeted by my friendly waiter, who kept the drink refills coming throughout my meal without being asked.  They have a current special with soup or salad, plus a selection of entrees, plus a small dessert, for $12.95, so I got that.  The salad was an OG salad, iceberg with various onions and such thrown in, but I do like their salad dressing and the salad was ice cold, which is how I prefer it.  I got a basket of 5 bread sticks for just me, and it was all I could do to not eat all 5.  They were soft and warm and quite tasty.  I got the bucatini with meat sauce for my entree, and it was fine - as expected.  I knew it wasn't going to be the best Italian(ish) dish I had ever had, but it got the job done.  The dessert was a small cake with a strawberry sauce layered in it it (I can't remember the name) and it was fine as well.  It tasted like something from the prepared food section at HT, and it was a sweet finish to my meal.  

The waitstaff was friendly and attentive without hovering, the food was fine and as expected.  It was A-OK."
"NC","I haven't been to an O.G. in a long time. I am suprised to say that things have changed for the better. If you're looking for real italian food this is not the place to go. But the foods that they are serving are great. The service was top notch. The menu change are cool. They stole that but one get one pasta deal form Maggianos which I love! You can go wrong in my opinion. Salty garlicy bread sticks and the non stop salad. Enough said.."
"NC","Oh Olive Garden...you really impressed me with your new menu options and I'm very happy to write this review!

It had been a while since I've visited and OG, mainly because I was tired of always ordering the same thing. But my parents were in town and wanted to stop in for dinner so I figured...why not?!?

We started with the Moscato, what I love about the wine here is that they always let you sample prior to ordering a glass and now they offer a glass and a half...whoooo hoooo! The Moscato is sweet, fruity and crisp! One of my absolute favorites!

Our appetizer was the lasagna fritta which is Parmesan breaded lasagna pieces, fried and served over Alfredo sauce topped with Parmesan cheese and marinara sauce. I must say this was a very delicious way to start the meal! The fried pieces of lasagna were hot and crispy and the two sauces and cheese were a perfect compliment! I would definitely recommend this to anyone! 

We also had the Zuppa Toscana which is spicy sausage, russet potatoes and cavolo greens in a creamy breath and salad. For the meals we had Tour di Mare which has three small portions of their creamy shrimp Alfredo, shrimp scampi fritta which are a new item of lightly fried shrimp tossed in a garlic and white wine sauce! They were very good the mix of favors offers a very unique taste! We also tried the Bucatini with meat sauce. The pasta is a little thicker that spaghetti noodles but equally delicious! 

Our server was outstanding and our food was delicious, I am absolutely looking forward to going back and trying some more of their new menu items!"
"NC","Came here for lunch with my pops, who was fiending for their $6.95 soup/salad/breadsticks extravaganza. He is a huge fan of this deal, but unfortunately did NOT receive it, since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, and they only offer their lunch specials on WEEKDAYS.

Another slight issue I had was the fact that the waiter messed up my order, but the manager gladly replaced it free-of-charge for me, and gave me her humble apologies. Once I received the dish I ordered - beef medallions over fettuccine alfredo - it was actually pretty tasty. It featured green onions, chives, sauteed spinach, and tasted pretty fresh, discounting the strong vinaigrette coating on the steak. My dad would have given this place four stars, but I am not my dad!"
"NC","I am not a fan of big corporate ""Italian-style"" chain resturants, and the OG is one of my least favorites (behind Maggianos, Macaroni Grill, and Bucca di Bepo). I would never choose to go here over a locally owned place, but unfortunately, there are times that I find myself at one of these types of places for a work or social event planned by someone else.  

That is how I ended up at this OG location.  There were about 15 of us, and you would think a big corporate chain like OG would be well versed in serving large groups, but on this particular visit, the service was even worse than the food (which is not very good in my opinion).

The service was PAINFULLY slow and the server(s) kept forgetting to bring items to the table.  It took forever to get drinks to the the table.  Then,  I had ordered soup with unlimited salad & breadsticks... as did several folks at the table.  With so many eating salad, it was gone in no time and it took forever to get more to the table. A couple of people didn't get their entrees at the same time, so awkwardly sat at the table waiting for food.  

This attempt at lunch ended up taking  2+ hours - which is ok for a dinner event but completely unacceptable at lunch time when you have to get back to work.  The bad service coupled with the mediocre food just makes this place a big waste of time.  Next time someone plans an event here - lunch or dinner - I will just have to respectfully decline."
"NC","Most people are aware that OG is far far from authentic...however it seems that OG has gone downhill in recent years, and has left it up to a marketing team to save them. Upon our most recent visit to this OG in Pineville, They gave me food poisoning. Having worked in the restaurant business for 15 years, I am very aware of what food poisoning is and is not. This was the real deal..my first hint should have been at the restaurant when the couple seated next us were complaining about their food. I doubt we'll ever be back."
"NC","Want a zero star option! I am a fan of olive garden but this one is horrible! Where do I start? Got soup without bread which came about 20 mins later as it was baking every time we would remind her although everyone around was getting baskets. Then Food ordered was new promos that had no details and had to rely on waitress which was clueless! She lied about the meal all together. Ended up with 2 meals un eaten. The bread finally arrived at end and lemon never came...she kept saying it was being cut! Ended with her dropping our plate on floor causing flying glass and never got a mint! Well at least she was smart enough to ask mgr to talk to us b4 us asking!"
"NC","My mother wanted to take my wife and I out to dinner for my wife's B-day, we were a party of eight, we were assigned two waitresses that had a difficult time getting on the same page. Wrong order, wrong drink refills, and it took 1:49 from the time we placed our order until the food reached the table. A member of our party stated a food allergy, he had to order twice and still received food that contained his stated allergy. Upon notifying the manager we were told not to worry the check was taken care of and he apologized. He suggested we dessert as well, which took another 34 minutes, and arrived with the check. Upon leaving we had to walk by the rear of the building were the waitress and manager were talking and over heard her complaining about us, when confronted the manager apologized again and returned inside. Needless to say we will not return to this location again, and I would suggest that you do the same. We were not the only ones with a grievance as several other 
patrons were given gift cards and comped bills."
"NC","I saw Brian F.'s review and decided to step in and stick up for a restaurant that has really blown me away the past couple visits. 
I've been at busy lunch/dinner times and have not had to wait more than 15 minutes either times. The service was AMAZING. Emika was our waitress during lunch ( 1 week ago) and Cindy was our waitress for the duration of our dinner experience (two days ago). Both were knowledgeable, friendly, and really went over and beyond. 
Always replenished our breadsticks and refilled our drinks without us even asking. 

During our last visit for dinner we got the 2 for $25 deal. Not one complaint. Before ordering from the menu I made sure to ask about the portion size and was reassured that they were the same as the regular dinner portions. ((( BUT, if you opt to get the appetizers instead of unlimited breadsticks and salad they would be smaller....we decied to go for the unlimited.) No disappointments with portions ( I got the Fett. Alfredo... classic...amazing...can't go wrong) It was so much that I had my leftovers for lunch the next day. My boyfriend also had to take the rest of his spaghetti home too. 
The food was awesome and the service was even better. WILL BE BACK. 

*** before leaving (both times) we asked for extra breadsticks so we could take them home to have with our leftovers...and there was no faces...no if ands or buts...both waitresses said no problem and brought us 4 to take home. 

I highly recommend the ""strata"". it's a chocolate cake that is to die for."
"NC","You know what Olive Garden is and so do I.  Despite being far from authentic, I typically enjoy their food about once or twice a year.  This time we had a gift card, so that was incentive enough to go.  They currently have a 2 for $25 which is okay, but the portions are a lot smaller than their regular entrees.  Yes, you get unlimited salad and breadsticks, but it's just iceberg salad.  The deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share.  It was enough for the price, but they should mention the portions are reduced.  Contrary to LR's review, I have ALWAYS taken leftovers home from OG.  I easily ate the whole entree after eating salad and breadsticks.  Unless they just reduced their portion size since the last time I went, these were definitely skimpy and did not come with that much chicken either.  The smoked chicken was decent.

Our friend got the unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks for dinner (yes they offer it for dinner for $3 more) but our less than friendly waitress snagged 2 of her breadsticks off of the table before she was finished. Why would you snag breadsticks from right in front of someone in the first place, let alone someone who has them as part of their meal. The spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth.  

All in all, it's not that good and there are better places you could go and not have to wait 45 minutes for a table.  Try a real, local Italian place, like Libretto's up the road or Portofino's on Park Rd.  Their dishes are made by real Italian people, not dreamed up in a corporate kitchen, and they give you your money's worth.  

Drive 5 minutes to Libretto's for real Italian food or 10 minutes to The Carolina Bistro."
"NC","Love their new deal, 2 for 25. The special menu had pretty good variety of  the appetizer and entree that you can choose. I don't recommend the bruschetta, because there is no Mozzarella, otherwise the whole meal was very pleasant. We got tons of food for very good price, in fact, we were so stuffed that we had to take almost both entire entree home."
"NC","We dined as a large party of 14!   I had the new parmesan crusted steak with cheese stuffed noodles, it was devine!  The waitress did great and helped make our birthday celebration even better!"
"NC","The minute you step into this OG, you will get the stench of smelly socks. Very hard to un-notice the smell. Service was poor, the waitress was just trying to get rid of us ASAP, even though we went in at 8PM (not too late for dinner in my opinion). The place is not clean, the table we sat was sticky.

Food was in par with the other OGs. Will I go there again ? nah for the amount of money I pay I would go some place else - that at the least doesnt smell.

Im giving this two stars only for the food."
"NC","Not all chain locations are created equal but Olive Garden seems to do a good job maintaining consistency. With that said, MY Olive Garden is located in Pineville at Carolina Place Mall. I go there for lunch and typically sit at the bar. I can always just sit right down and not have to wait in line. 

The food is always good. I love the soup and salad combination - it's perfect for lunch. But the BEST PART OF SITTING AT THE BAR IS BEING SERVED BY VILDEN. Vilden is, without fail, friendly and attentive. Sometimes when I am deciding on where to have lunch, I go because of Vilden. I know she will make me feel welcome and appreciated."
"NC","Went here becuase my in-laws wanted to try it out. Not a big fan of Olive Garden but you can't go wrong with their food. 

We went on a weekend so it was busy. The table they sat us at, smelled so badly!!! I did not even want to put my purse down. The area smelled like throw up or smelly feet. This made my food experience not good. 

The place is just older and needs some renovations. Please change your carpets!"
"NC","In some cities (Detroit for example), Olive Garden is the place you go once a year for something really special--wearing your Sunday best.  In Charlotte, Olive Garden is the place you go when you want some fairly good italian food--wearing your shorts and t-shirt.  The Zuppa Tuscana (soup) is really good.  The alfredo sauce is pretty good too.  One thing you must try (if you are of age) is the Sangria.  Excellent."
"NC","I've been to a number of Olive Gardens across the country and this one by far has me most unimpressed of all. 

Our server, Derek A. (tall, bald guy), was hopeless to say the least. He didn't mention any specials, didn't get us our drink refills in time and never offered any additional bread sticks or salad. Finally waited forever to ask for a to-go box and our check, only to hear him whine to another person right behind us about how he can't seem to catch a break and how he can't even pronounce my name. Ahem, ok, but don't say it right in front of the customer?? :)

Food portions were great and entrees were yummy, but breaksticks were not warm as we've come to expect from Olive Gardens. And did I mention that we didn't get any extra? :D

Anyways, horrible experience. Maybe he was having an off day, but I'd suggest asking to be waited by someone else (everyone else seemed wonderful!) and I believe your server's attitude is directly proportional to your dining experience."
"NC","I was very unimpressed with this Olive Garden location.  The service was subpar- I sat at the bar and the bartender was far more interested in talking to coworkers than the few patrons at the bar.

Secondly, the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company. The Zuppa Toscana was devoid of the spiciness that makes the soup as well as full of fatty sausage.

I also ordered the Ravioli di Portobello, it came out stone cold, unacceptable for a baked entree. I sent it back and the second time it came out it was just as cold. I finally spoke to a manager who comp'd my meal. I will never be back to this location."
"NC","This Olive Garden sometimes has problems in the kitchen.  One time I visited they changed the pasta fagioli soup from a hearty meat based soup to a runny tomato based one.  The pasta fagioli soup is my only reason to get soup and salad for dinner because it's usually really good.  

So I wrote to corp through their website and they sent me a gift certificate.  I gave this location another try and thankfully it's back to normal.  So go with caution and be prepared to deal with lackluster performance.  I love OG on the whole and give most locations at least four stars, but this one has done it's best to tarnish their image."
"NC","I received a free entree coupon for my birthday from Tony Roma's, so I used to it to get some takeout since I am alone this week and my husband is gone on a business trip. Otherwise I would have brought him with me and we could have dined in! 
I'd never eaten here before, so I thought it would be great to give their food a test run.

The girl who brought my food out, (hostess I assume by outfit) walked over with a straight face and asked me if my name was the one on the to go order. It was. She handed me the food and still with a straight, almost unfriendly face asked for the coupon. I handed it to her and gave her a tip also. I always tip, even on free food! I was a server for 2 years at Red Lobster. She didn't smile once and gave off a very unfriendly, almost hostile vibe. Really made me sad. She made me feel like crap for using the coupon that the company sent me!! And I gave her a tip!! Its not like she got nothing out of it!
I ordered the steakhouse burger (was craving a yummy burger since Im pregnant) and fries. The fries were bad. Not crispy but chewy and not very salty. The burger was pretty yummy, but was slopped in the box carelessly. :/ 
Doesn't seem like good customer service. This was my test run, and I know not to go back and take my husband now."
"NC","Currently here at the restaurant. It's noisy, crowded, disorganized, and there are not enough waiters. In our case we got out appetizer and our entree with about a 2-3 minute seperation. They had not even cooled enough to eat them before we got the entree. We were not the only one either, the people next to us had the same thing happen with an even shorter delay. So lets move onto the entree... Two steaks both looked good on the outside. One ordered medium the other medium rare... Both are RARE beyond rare. Giant red center all the way to the edge. This place is to expensive for the level of service that they provide.

So after this bad experience why did I give a two star review instead of a one.... Because the potato skins were delicious"
"NC","If you stay at the Hilton garden inn, you get a free appetizer with your room card. I ordered the onion loaf, which is essentially onion rings molded into a circular wall and  looks like a nest. Pretty neat concept, except I've had better deep fried onions.

Their medallion steak filets were really really great and perfectly cooked. It also came with a half rack of ribs, which were well cooked, but their original BBQ sauce was the worst I've had. I had to switch out for the honey BBQ sauce instead.

Overall, it was a great meal, but you can also find good steaks elsewhere with better ribs. Also, the only other people there were old people."
"NC","This was our first time back in a few years, and once again, they have a new menu.

This time we (my wife and I) just stuck to the basics......Chicken Tenders w/ fries and I had the Chicken Sandwich w/ Cheese, Bacon and BBQ Sauce with fries.

The service was fast and friendly, and the food this time was outstanding.

I am not sure that I like the new menu and prices, but we will consider coming back in the future, for the chicken.

The restaurant is very clean and the decor is very casual......

"NC","Ate lunch here. Was good!  Service was friendly"
"NC","Went for the first time last night, but have been hearing about this place for years.  Passing by I always thought this was an Italian place because of the name Tony Roma's but its more of a Steakhouse with a little bit of everything, and known for there Ribs.  Strangely enough I ended up getting a pasta dish....lol. I had the Chicken Pasta Linguine which was new to menu.  I have to say it was quite yummy.  My friends had the Ribs of course, and said they were outstanding.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was good, and the waitress was very attentive. I don't see myself coming back anytime soon, but definitely would go if someone else recommended it."
"NC","Been eating here for three years now, and the service is always good, as is the food. My daughter (5) loves the ribs, as do I.  Our favorite thing to eat here, though, are the Carolina Honey Bites off the appetizer menu.   I've had nothing like them, so they always hit the spot and start the meal off right.  Strongly recommend to fans of ribs."
"NC","I've been to this place at least four times now. (once every month) I've had good experiences all four times that I've gone. I do however go during lunch time when they aren't as busy. We also go when we get their buy one entree get one free coupon in the mail. It's an awesome deal! 

They have a huge variety on both their drink and food menu. I will say that I think they have the best steaks compare to Applebee's and Chilli's. Their steaks are super tender and the server always ask you to cut your steak to make sure its cook the way you asked."
"NC","I'm always perplexed about coming to this restaurant. It's not like I don't know what the foods going to taste like, I know that I'll get unlimited soda [insert simulated gagging sounds here], I know the décor, and that mystical scent in the air. I suspect, that we always go back because of the service, really could there be any other reasons. OK, aside from the ribs, which I'm not sure if I've passed my phobia of touching my food. Yes, I said it, I said it on the Internet, I don't like touching my food. Anyhow, I suspect we always go back because of the service. The service? The service. For some reason, this restaurant gets it, from the front door to the kitchen and back again. It's strange and in all my years of observing these types of things, I would have never imagined it at Tony Roma's. Plus, we always have a good time laughing for some reason at the restaurant. Like the other night, where this overzealous waiter kept vacuuming the floor in the middle of dinner service using a busted battery powered vacuum. OK, so we asked him to stop twice, not once, twice. Are you kidding me? We made a joke about it when my friend ran out with one of the units pretending to vacuum, it was so funny and caused his brother to bolt from his chair ready to snag the unit from the person's hands not knowing it was his brother. Try Tony Roma's and you won't be disappointed, I really enjoy the soups and salads. Yes, I touch my food."
"NC","I had been a fan of TR for years. Saturday was my first time back and I was dissapointed in the changes. The menu had changed greatly. They took away all the samplers of different ribs and the portions are much smaller. The price has gone up alot also. The ribs taste good but for the price it's just not worth me going back. I heard they were having a tough time thru the county but the changes made I don't believe will make them better."
"NC","So far really slow food service . Took over half an hour to get main entree after getting the drinks and appetizer.  

Server was good, but my filet medallion was off . A second filet medallion was undercooked. By this time I was done with my ribs,which were very tasty, and my sides and I asked to see the manager. The manager gave an apology and only charged for the ribs. okay, but won't be going back soon . 

My Strawberry Limeade,an alcoholic beverage, was great!"
"NC","I Had a great steak, great waiter, and great drinks.  Nothing to complain about here."
"NC","Wow! The tenderloin medallions were out of this world! Full if flavor and choice of topping. The service was fantastic as well. I have no complaints here."
"NC","I came here initially seeking Sriracha, but unfortunately, this location did not carry it. The very handsome sales associate (near the computer stuff on 8/23) with the moist blue eyes and sandy hair was incredibly helpful to my friend and me. He searched other stores for Sriracha and skillfully wrote directions for us. I've never received directions as precise as those he gave us. This sales associate was exceptional and smelled really good. I highly recommend this location for its staff (but don't go here for Sriracha)."
"NC","AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE:
I have been to this location 3 times in the past year.  This office depot is the closest one to my work, but if it was closer to my home it would be the location I frequent most often.  In the 3 times I have come in, someone has stopped to help me as soon as I enter the doors.  They are also excited when customers enter the doors.  It's not like the normal humdrum of ""do you need help"", but a genuine interest in what you need with phrases like, ""What can I help you with today?""  They greet me, walk over, then ask me if I need assistance.  If they are in the middle of helping someone else, they will have to point to what I need, but if not they will walk me to it or to the associate that can better help me.  When I've gotten to my particular dept each time, the associate working in the dept always assists me.  I am a somewhat picky person when it comes to work ledgers, calendars, files, etc, and on the 3 occasions I have been to this location every associate has been helpful in finding the perfect thing. They are knowledgable about the products they carry, the location of them, shipping of certain items,  and the stocking of them. The cashier assisting me on 2 occasions was the same.  I don't remember her name, but she was short, older,grayish hair, and a smile on her face.  She has always been super friendly and all about the new promotions etc that they have. She is a true gem in customer service just like the rest.
 
BEAUTIFUL STORE:
There has not been a single time I've come into this store and seen a mess from stocking, a customer, etc.  It is always very clean and organized. It is always well-stocked with few product holes. 

STAFFING:
There is always someone there to assist you, so this store is staffed very well.  When you get to the register, you rarely have to wait in any line and there are always people up front ready to assist you.  And of course, amazing customer service.  I feel as if every employee has been hand-picked to complement the store, so kudos to mgmt even though I've never met you!

ATMOSPHERE:
The store is well-lit with a good layout.  Products are easily found and accessible.  The staff creates an air of excitement every time I come in. 

LOCATION:  
The biggest downfall.  It's hard to navigate in and out of here due to the location on 51, and I have to drive out and take a u-turn to get where I need to be. 

As an office supply nut, this store fuels my addiction!! I do wish this store was closer to my home in a neighboring town as seemingly everything is better, but especially the customer service. It's so nice to walk into a business and feel welcome and appreciated no matter what I look like, no matter how little or how much I'm buying, and no matter how busy the store is upon my arrival."
"NC","Big box meets office supplies, the OD also sells office furniture, computers and other electronics. Prices can be competitive but I wouldn't bet on it. Shop around.

However if you're looking for supplies, like paper and pens or in my case, binder clips, this is the spot. Staff is friendly and the store is well organized, brightly lit and neatly stocked."
"NC","What can I say about Starmount Cleaners? Well, everything Brad Y. (4/13/2010) said and more! I take a ton of clothes to them on a bi-weekly basis and they always do a great job. Not only do they remember my name, but they remember my life events as well. As for ever damaging clothes, in the 8 years I've been going there they have only damaged 1 item.  The owner (who is not rude) brought it to my attention right away and paid for it (and it was a $50.00 shirt). I love supporting this hardworking family owned small business!!!"
"NC","I am all for supporting local small businesses in my communi, butafter having one of my $50 dress shirts sliced in the same two spots on each sleeve by Starmount cleaners i would never return. The owner is very rude, denied damaging my shirt and tried telling me the shirt wore out. Obviously they are dishonest, and are not concerned with long term customer satisfaction. Further, they do their own dry cleaning in-house and do not do as good of a job as the ones who send it out. Avoid this place at all costs. If they damage or loose your items they will leave you out to dry, literally."
"NC","You don't need fancy computer controlled cash registers and racks to get a shirt clean.  

The husband and wife team that own Starmount Cleaners work six days a week and they have not yet invested in a computerized order taking system.  Maybe that's why they always:

--Remember my name
--Remember I like medium starch
--Return my clothes quickly 
--Do so for only $1.50 per shirt

I tried a lot of the bigger cleaners, paid a lot more money and was never satisified until I found this hole in the wall cleaners.  This is one mom and pop you shouldn't miss."
"NC","I went in Treadquarters Pineville 3 weeks ago to get a patch on my tire. Today I was washing my car I noticed a big scratch on my wheel that went the entire way around. In the past I worked at a custom wheel and tire shop and know that the only thing that will cause this type of damage is if the technician does not pull the wheel weight off the wheel when he dismounts or installs the tire after a repair. Now everybody makes mistakes but back at the tire shop I worked at if the technician made a mistake and caused any kind of damage he would inform the customer. This was not the case at Tread Quarters Pineville. When I went back to Treadquarters to show them the damage, the same young man as mentioned in ""(Aaren H)"" negative review told me that there is no way that this was the cause of the damage and that I probably curbed my wheel.  Are you freaking kidding me??? It seemed as though he took it personally and then told me that he will file a claim. (In which I still have not heard from the company) I will also make note that he told me that this damage does not affect his hourly pay or anything at the shop.  I have never dealt with such poor management in my life.  This sort of treatment is inexcusable and I have no problem letting everyone I know the the poor treatment I received at Treadquarters in Pineville."
"NC","I wish it were possible to give a business 0 stars because this auto repair facility committed several cardinal sins today and are not trustworthy. 

(Background: I am a young female who has had plenty of trouble with being treated unfairly in the auto repair world. It is my pet peeve. It is wrong. And you - mechanics - should feel ashamed for taking advantage of women car owners because you think you can.)

I went to Treadquarters today for help after I noticed a screw had punctured my tire earlier this morning. The tire wasn't deflated yet and the screw was deeply embedded in the tread. I needed a patch so I could go on about my day. When I looked Treadquarters up online they were advertising ""Free Tire Repair"" with some exclusions, none of which applied to me. This coupon, paired with their good reviews, made it an easy decision to stop by. 

The young man who greeted me seemed a little turned off by my coupon. I'm assuming this company offers such incentives so that customers will bring them other business that creates better revenue. A smart strategy. However, it doesn't work if your employees are begrudging and dishonest. He went out to my car to look at the damage and proceeded to feed me some bullsh*t about the screw being too close to the side wall. The screw was definitively NOT in the side wall or anywhere near it, no matter how many times he tried to show me with his ""thumb measurement"". It was only about an inch away from the mid-line of tire. Regardless, this young man said it couldn't be patched and that I needed to buy a new tire. I didn't argue because I knew differently since my dad works on cars and I had already sent him a picture of the situation. I thanked the jerk for his time and drove off. 

A few miles down the road, I stopped at Woodies. I told the front desk guy there about my situation and he said they would take a look. My tire was patched and I was back on the road in 30 minutes. I will be doing a separate review for the great service I received at Woodies. 

This type of treatment is inexcusable and I have no qualms with denouncing the entire company until they deal with their dishonest employees. He tried to ""screw"" me over. Bad move buddy."
"NC","I have been servicing my car here for a year, and I have only had good experiences here.

1. The staff works hard to make sure you are getting the best prices on parts and they charge reasonable rates for labor.
2. They stand by their warranty.  I had my timing belt changed, and after a couple of months i thought it was idling loud.  They took care of the problem with no additional charges.
3. They don't nickel and dime you.  At the Subaru dealership and Woodies, they charge me $75 - $90 just to look at the car.  At tread quarters I asked for a couple of lights to be replaced on top of getting my breaks replaced, and they took care of it for no additional charge.
4. They stand by their quote, and charge you for the exact time worked, even if it comes in under the quote.  At woodies they charged me the full price of the quote, even though they only worked on the car for half the time of the original quote."
"NC","I stopped in to get a serpentine belt replaced that I had in hand.  It broke on my lunch hour so I went to AutoZone and bought one.  I how long it would be to get to it and how long it would take.  They said they could get to it ""right now"" and it shouldn't take long.  30 minutes later they pulled it in the shop.  1 hour later it was completed.  They tried to charge me $212 for 2 hours of labor.  I asked how could it take 2 hours when it was only the shop for 1 hour and I was there for 1.5 hours.  They then corrected it and charged me a flat fee of $99.07.  If this is their generic price for 1 hour of labor it is ridiculous.  It shouldn't have take an hour to do it anyway.  This is the first and last time I will visit here.  They also pulled my car in front and left it running while the bill was being discussed.  I am very unhappy with their service and will let everyone I come in contact with.

Update.  The owner called me to apologize. He asked me to call back and get a full refund.  He also had a free oil change put on my account.  I called to get the refund.  I probably won't be back.  It's not convienent for me.  I only stopped because I needed ta repair that day and they were close.

This occured on 9/27/2011."
"NC","Buying tires is one of the most intimidating experiences for me because I don't know much about them. Last week, I discovered an online coupon for Carolina Tire & Auto. I came to the store and met the sales manager who walked me through several options and helped me make a selection. He even helped me figure out how to save more money.
I live near uptown and never would have traveled all the way to Pineville for anything -- but in this case, good service is worth the drive."
"NC","While I normally don't review auto repair places, I felt compelled to quickly review Carolina Tire. While they aren't the cheapest, they are by far the most professional, efficient and reliable auto repair business I've encountered during my time in Charlotte.

Some key points:
1. They charge a fair price and don't nickel and dime you on the ""extra's"" - what they quote is what they charge. Also some nice value-adds like free roadside assistance with oil changes.
2. They are professional - you are dealing with folks who view this as their career and honor their work.
3. Consistency - it's very underrated! When I need to get my oil changed or car fixed, I want the same experience and no surprises. Carolina Tire delivers on that promise.
4. They have a good waiting area, complete with a children's play area, big screen TV and free wifi.

Only downside is that their location is not handy for walking to the mall or restaurants - if you need a ride they will take you to Lynx, but the location doesn't have a lot of stuff immediately next door.

Overall I'm a big fan!"
"NC","We've been ordering pizza from here for 20 years. The delivery or pick up is always on time and the pizza is very good! Thin crust is the best! Thank you, Domino's Quail Corners!"
"NC","THIS location is the best! I do not know about other Domino's locations, however, this one is utterly fantastic! First let me say, the price for a large 3 topping carryout is superb - only $8.65 compared to $12 (and change) for a xtra large ONE topping from Papa John's. I'd never thought I'd see the day where I'd say that Domino's is better than Papa John's but this pizza I had on this day was DELICIOUS - some of the best pizza I have ever, if not the best, had! The young lady, Jennifer, I believe, has to be one of the best pizza makers there is - OMG! Kudos! When I want pizza - this is the place from now on at the Park Rd Locale!"
"NC","I cannot tell a lie! GULP. When the urge for a fast, hot pizza happens...and I'm in the area...I give Domino's a call or order online.  It may not be gourmet pizza...but dang it!  The new cheesy bread (which is on special for $5.99 if you order two or more...not that I have recently...) is pure salty, cheesy, flavorful goodness.  It really hits the spot when you're starving and want something utterly not good for your waistline. I also think their new pizza recipe is pretty good. 

I like this location because I've never had a problem with the service.  They're always on time when estimating how long it'll take for your order to be ready.  Keep in mind, busy times, like Friday nights or weekends can be super busy, and delivery may take awhile, so plan ahead. 

Okay, I'm going to hide my head under the table now...and enjoy my slice."
"NC","Great food with friendly atmosphere. Great staff. I had scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, bacon, and orange juice during a business meeting. Great restaurant. I'll come back!"
"NC","Best breakfast in Charlotte I've had. Definitely recommend the French Toast Biscuits. Simply amazing."
"NC","I have been eating breakfast and lunch at the Kopper Kettle for over 20 years and it never disappoints.  I get eggs over easy with grits and liver mush and it is always great.  My wife loves the Greek omelette.  The staff is super friendly.  I would highly recommend this place to everyone."
"NC","My wife Sandy an i have breakfast here everyday of the week.  The owners treat us and the other customers as a VIP.  The staff is very attentative and personable.  We always are greated with a smile and leave smiling.  We have been to several resturants  in Charlotte and the service and food are exceptional!  We would give 10 stars if possible."
"NC","Great comfort food!!!

I noticed some less than stellar reviews - I used to eat at the KK 25 years ago when the Karnezis's owned it....  Over time it changed hands, and know it is back in their hands!  So if you tried it in the past and were not happy, try it again!"
"NC","Cheap, good comfort food. This place has been around a long time, the wait staff is super friendly, and the tea is super sweet.

You can't go wrong with their fried fish-it was delicious!, or the meat and two they have every day."
"NC","I don't like to give out one stars and I don't give them out lightly without an explanation. I was out driving looking for yard sales in the area when we passed this cute little restaurant. I figured it was probably going to be some amazing southern cooking and my heart was craving some delicious buttered pancakes. To my dismay they were done with breakfast once we arrived. Ah well. No big deal.

We sat at our table and it took a bit for our server to come and talk to us, and there were only a couple people there. I felt as if our being there was an inconvenience and I was pretty bummed since I'd had such high expectations of the place. We ordered Mt. Dew & when they brought it out, it was in a can. So, obviously, no free refills. Ok. That I was even sort of ok with... 

Well when our food came out, I ordered the veggie plate, which was 3 sides. A salad with ranch dressing, mashed potatoes and gravy & corn were my meal & my boyfriend ordered the roast beef special that the server swore by. 

My salad came out and it had only lettuce on the plate with a gallon of ranch dressing. No carrots, cheese, onions or anything but it had a slice of tomato that appeared to have mold on it. Gross. I ate a few bites of the lettuce drenched in ranch before I noticed the tomato & then I pushed it aside. My boyfriend tried the roast beef and said it was so chewy he had to grind it against his teeth for awhile to chew it up & it was just bland in general. 

I took a bite of the potatoes because at that point I figure it was the best thing I'd be eating at this place. I stuck them in my mouth and wow... they were flavorless. It was seriously like I'd taken a bite of textured air. Really??? So I said nothing and offered a bite to my boyfriend to see what his reaction was because I knew he wouldn't believe me if I told him. 

He took the bite and stopped chewing immediately and looked at me with a questioning look, and said, ""Gross."" The corn was good but that was seriously the only thing I could even eat. He ate a portion of his sandwich and left the rest because he just couldn't do it. I was actually a little angry by this point because I can't believe a place that has been around so long could be this terrible. 

When we got the bill, it was almost $30!!!!! Yeah and those cans of pop we ordered, $1.50 each! Ridiculous. I will never return to this place and if you're driving by I wouldn't recommend it. Really sad about this one."
"NC","The breakfast here is really good however their lunch could use some work. A lot of the vegetables are watered down and don't have much flavor. I would recommend trying this place on a Tuesday when they serve their baked chicken. It's really good."
"NC","For a quick and cheap bite this place is amazing!

When my friend pulled in here I was a little caught off guard, not really knowing what to expect. But once we walked inside; it  was pretty cool there, I really liked how there were records lining the walls and random ""home"" touches lined against that some classic yellow flower wallpaper.  

It's seat yourself, but in no time the waitress brings the menus and gets your drinks. The menu is simple but the prices are amazing!!! You can tell this place is a favorite of the locals. There were several customers that came in after us, that our waitress already knew their name and drink order before they even sat down. Now, that's great customer service with a down home southern feel!

I went with the breakfast special, two eggs, your choice of meat (ham, bacon, turkey sausage, sausage) and side (grits or home fries) with your choice of a biscuit or toast.  And did I mention that all of that is less than $4!!!

The portion sizes here are excellent, I was more than pleased when it came out, I chose my eggs scrambled, with home fries, toast and bacon. There were plenty of home fries which tasted great, huge chucks of potatoes with just the right amount of seasoning. My eggs were scrambled hard, just as I requested and the bacon was crispy. Delish! I enjoyed everything on my plate, but definitely left some behind. 

I really enjoyed my meal, strongly recommend you stopping by for a bite! I know I will definitely be back!"
"NC","Amazing food! I ordered a grilled cheese on rye with eggs that were perfectly cooked. The staff is quick, friendly and will ensure you have a hearty and delicious meal. I would definitely come back if I lived in the area!"
"NC","Had a Breakfasts meeting last week & enjoyed a wonderful breakfast.  I imagine my cholesterol jumped, however it was delicious food.  Steak Omelet, I'm thinking imitation steak but no, also with 3 types of cheeses what could go wrong.  You would think that with that may types of cheeses it would be heavy but no just the right blend & amount cheese & steak.  Home Fries come with it and all I can say is I hope your hungry.  The portion is quite large.  I'm guessing about 1/3 of my plate was home fires.  Overall service was good and food good, price is average for a dinner type atmosphere.  Definitely will add them to my list of restaurants to revisit."
"NC","The Corner Cafe is the quintessential ""meat & three"" type restaurant. Situated in industrial Arrowood and a 1/2 mile from I-77 and I-485, The Corner is the perfect breakfast and lunch place for folks who work in the area and travelers passing through. The food is consistent and good. Their menu has daily specials and vegetables plates as well as Greek specialties. Faye greets you at the door and treats you like she really cares. Be sure to check out the collection of vinyl LP covers lining the wall!"
"NC","Great food. Great down-home atmosphere and friendly staff. Breakfast is wonderful and the coffee is good. Waffle house is crowded yet Corner Cafe is better all the way around."
"NC","This place had availability as we were calling everyone, when we got there it has a strong odor, I asked to see where they were keeping her and they said ohh we will get someone to show u. Once the person came and got us and showed us where she was going to be I almost cried with the loudness of the dogs barking giving me a headache as she was shaking I almost wanted to say forget it but we were in a hurry. I felt as go my dog went to doggy hell. The staff was more mindset on other things then telling us about what she would be doing and if they took them out for potty breaks, I'm guessing they just go in their cage, how gross, so that was disappointing. We dropped her off at 4pm on sat and were told we can only pick her up Sunday between 3-6pm and that the first night free but we got charged for two nights?? Wtf? So we ended up paying $37.00 I never received any pic of her and when I asked about it they pretty much ignored me. I liked Ironton boarding as they seem more in tune with saying hi to your furry friend and facility was calm and collective, and only $22 a night and have the friendliest staff that are always happy to see you. Dogs also get some time to run in a huge play area outside. I will NEVER take my dogs to Best friend pet care ever again!!!"
"NC","These guys are great!!!
My boyfriend took his dog here the other day and they took him without an appointment with no hassles! They did a great job and we got our baby back in a reasonable time! 
We will be back."
"NC","You can definitely trust Best Friends with your little pup.  They have such a sweet staff who definitely love animals!  You are greeted by such friendly people and if you've stayed there before and enrolled your dog in the group play or one-on-one play time, a picture of your dog will come up on their TV screens in the lobby.  What a fun welcome!

When it comes to boarding for overnight trips out of town it can be difficult leaving my anxious little fluffball.  So I appreciate that I can sign him up for one on one play time for some extra TLC.  Also fun, they will send you a picture to your phone of your pet playing in the yard or with other dogs--such a sweet gesture that eases my mind when I'm already feeling guilty for leaving him behind.

In addition to boarding they do a great job with pet grooming.  It's one of the most expensive places to go but I would say it's usually worth it.  We'd had some crazy shavings and haircuts come out of the cheaper groomers (I'll never forget when he had long hair all over except for a shaved butt...I suppose they were going for a babboon look??)  But at Best Friends they do excellent work and my little pup comes out looking gorgeous."
"NC","I've been bringing Howie here for three years. From grooming with Jill to playtime with Nancy, Amber, Patti and the entire team, to kennel stays...I can't imagine going anywhere else.  Can be a little pricey is you spoil your pet with all the extras, but aren't our furry friends worth it?

I think the first might is free. Tell them I sent you!"
"NC","LOVE THIS PLACE!  Best Friends treats my baby like no other.  She goes there, and they treat her like she is one of their own.
Now, having said this, we haven't taken advantage of the boarding or doggie day-care services.  Sammie gets groomed about every other month and she loves it!  The rates are reasonable ($60 - She's a mid-sized Black Lab/Border Collie Mix), and they think of everything.  They know that I work all day, so they let me drop her off first thing in the morning and pick her up on my way home from work.  After she is finished with her grooming, she plays with the other dogs that are there for Doggie Day-Care.
Sammie smells so good when I pick her up and she always has a cute bandana on her.  To add that personal touch, whenever I make an appointment, they ask me if I'd like the same groomer as last time.  Heather is Sammie's ""Best Friend"".  I know that she will take good care of Sammie whenever I drop her off.  In the end, that's what is most important to me.  I know that Sammie has a great day whenever she goes to Best Friends."
"NC","I recently went out of town for 4 days and decided to try Best Friends Pet Care.  The staff was pretty friendly and the whole boarding process was pretty simple and fast.  My major gripe is when I picked up my two dogs four days later, they both smelled really badly, one of them had feces caked to her entire underside with a cut on her back right leg, and as soon as I took them outside they acted as if they hadn't been out to go all day as they immediately went right off the sidewalk (both of them peed and pooped!  - this never happens, usually I have to walk them forever to get them to go).  I did like the fact that they sent me a picture of them during my trip and that they gave me a report card - although the card said both of their bowel movements were normal - but when they went as soon as I took them from the facility, it was both diarrhea.  Overall, the place is nice, folks are friendly...I was just not pleased with the condition of my dogs when I picked them up."
"NC","I was a bit skeptical about boarding my dog since I take him wherever I go but I heard rave reviews this place. That being said, I was a tad nervous when taking my dog there last summer. The staff was extremely friendly and understanding about my apprehension about leaving my dog and I thank them for that. When I was away, they emailed me a picture of my dog so I could see he was doing well (plus you can go online and see them on their webcam during play time) They also offer additional packages with more play time, ice cream doggie treats, bed time stories (don't laugh, thats just cute) and more. My dog was so happy when I went to pick up, I think he was even smiling! I think their prices are pretty reasonable for overnight stay compared to some other joints in the area and have taken him there a few times since.  

 Best Friends also offers your pets first night free which is pretty sweet seeing that I have nothing against saving $$$$ here and there and they provide you with a report card when you pick them up--again--cute!! Even though I dont like near there anymore, I would definitely go there again and can't recommend them enough."
"NC","My dog hates animals, but loves this place. He's at home in his private junior suite, and has all his girlfriends around him, albeit they're human (Best Friends staff). My beagle always has a great time and his report card always says he was ""excited"" and ""talkative"". Thanks for being nice Best Friends staff (ha). 

Only thing is that's it's a little pricey ($29/night) and then you had packages or extras and it's abut $35-$40/day. For a week vacation or a weekend getaway for me and the wife, it can get expensive. That said; the little Satan likes it there, so at least he's happy while we're out of town."
"NC","Let me start off this review by saying this - I love my dog, but he is a difficult little guy. He has horrible separation anxiety and he loathes other dogs....we adopted him and we handle it the best we can.

Knowing this, the staff at Best Friends are awesome! They really take care of my pup and we really appreciate his ""report card"" when we pick him up. If we're gone on a long trip they don't mind us calling and checking on him. AND, as of the past few visits they now e-mail me a photo of my dog during his stay...it's adorable. My only teeny gripe is that the a la carte services can add up quick...I wish they included a walk with their daily $28 boarding rate. 

I highly recommend Best Friends to all parents of fur babies!"
"NC","I was directed to this business by another Yelper - Emily H.

My baby just got back from her spa day (shampoo, cut, blow dry and nails).

I love how she looks (in spite of the pink bandana) and how she smells.  And I was very impressed with the staff.  Lori did a great job grooming.  Jill was very attentive, pointing out a small cut on the dog's side - likely caused by the other dog in our house but hidden by all of the fur - when she called to tell me the dog was finished.  It's really obvious that everyone there loves and cares very much for dogs.

There's a First Time Customer discount and a Frequent Customer program (no charge to join) and discounts when services are bundled.  So make sure to ask to maximize your value and visit.

BTW, the webcam rocks!  I didn't get a thing done this morning because I kept watching the webcam but it sure provided some peace of mind that my baby was being well cared for.

Emily H - thanks again for the recommendation!"
"NC","We use them for daycare weekly and we are extremely pleased.  The staff is so nice and they truly care for ALL the dogs that stay with them.  They even give you a  doggy report everyday.  We are VERY happy and Lexi comes home every time just as happy :)"
"NC","I boarded my dogs here and spent thousands of dollars with this place because of our travel schedule. I  lost a lot of money with my business and couldn't afford to get my dogs. When we called they said no payment, no dogs. Ok, I understand but then they tried to say we had abandoned the dog's. They would not give me the dogs and work out a payment plan. They shipped all 3 of my dogs off and won't say where they are. I understand they wanted their money. They sent us to collections and gave my dogs away and said it was in the contract that we signed that they can do that. They said they have no idea where the dogs are now.  When I say we spent a lot of money with them, it was thousands over time when you are paying for multiple dogs. My issue is if you are going to ship my dogs off you could have given them to me and work something out and they never told me they were shipping the dogs off. They told us after they shipped them off! I had to give one star rating but only because u have to."
"NC","DANGER: This place is way too small to take in the number of dogs that it takes. The online viewing is deceiving and makes this place look larger than what it is. They will try to take your dog and quickly escort him/her into the play room. However, be sure to ask for a tour and see the space. I took the tour and the space is SMALL. I was there one day and they had 17 dogs in a space the size of my living room. That is dangerous! If something were to happen (ie. a fight) all of the dogs would join (pack behavior) and there would be nothing they could do to protect your pup."
"NC","I have boarded my pup here on two separate trips in the past month or so for a few nights each time and couldn't be happier.  I was a little hesitant at first since she has never been apart from family, but after researching local places and reading the reviews, I am glad we chose to send her here!

They email you pictures of your dog while they are there, which is really nice.  If you call to check up on your dog, they will put you on hold and go check on your dog at that minute and let you know what your dog is up to!  There are so many different options to choose from - single walks with a staff member, general play time, etc.  Also, if you get your dog groomed on the last day of boarding, they will waive that day's fee in lieu of the bath/nails/etc fee which is nice.  They do a really good job with bathing/nails too.

They also send your pup home with detailed report cards on how they were each day - even down to the detail of their bathroom schedule & how much food/water they ate.  It is really apparent how much care they put into each dog's visit with them and I feel a lot better about leaving my peanut with them."
"NC","Best friends pet care has been the only place I know my golden retriever will receive the same care and love that I give to him. My coop has been coming here for four years and he acts like every day is his first, he comes in with such excitement and the ladies at the desk know him by name and they get down to his level and hug him and give him lots of petting and complements! Coop gets treated like a king here, he enjoys doggie day-camp, his two bedroom suite with comfortable bedding even I would like to sleep on! Also, coop gets his bubble bath and paw-icure even a nice trim just before I am scheduled to pick him up. Coop then greets me with a big hug when I come to pick him up along with a good report card from the staff at the desk. They all tell me how well behaved he was and they look forward to him coming back. Not only is ""best friends"" coop's best friends but they are mine too because they love him the way I love my dog!!!"
"NC","I took my dog here to be boarded.  He came home unhappy, but I didn't think much of it (maybe he just missed us).   I used them a second time to groom my dog.  This is where the problem arose.  When I went to pick up my dog, they gave me someone elses pet.  Even though this was a chocolate lab (like mine), it was obviously not my dog.  Then they argued with me saying he was he only chocolate lab they had.  Well....one hour later and 3 other labs (I thought mine was the only one!)...they finally found my dog.  I wouldn't recommend this place unless you hate your dog and want to trade him in for another model."
"NC","Quickly losing stars. Nickle and dime you. Not a fan.

Hubs went shopping for some sparkle and shine for me. He did very well! He mentioned that once he picked out the earrings he was told that there is an extra charge for the earring posts. What?! How do the posts not come with the earrings (especially when you throw down a lot of Benjamins to begin with)? That is just crazy. 

Next, the necklace he gave me as a gift was a tad too long. So I went in and had the receipt and asked to exchange the chain for a shorter one. The employee then proceeded to tell me that I would have to drop it off, they would have it the following day, and there would be a charge to shorten it. What?! 

Paying for a gift given to you is nuts. That's most of a jeweler's business...sweethearts buying for their sweetheart as a surprise and they won't always get the size right.

In any case, thankfully the two employees that my husband worked with when he was in and the other that helped me when I was there worked with us to comp the earring posts and got my chain corrected that same moment at no charge. The employees and jewelry itself saved this review from being a 1 star.

Needless to say, after these recent experiences I'm even more inclined to take my business to the local mom & pops jewelers. I don't appreciate the extra fees and hassle that seems to be part of the process with this company. Jared's has gotten too big and too corporate and lost its focus on building relationships and loyalty with customers. I don't remember Jared's being like this in the past, but I heard they purchased Zales and a lot has changed. 

Too bad, Jared's. Your jewelry is gorgeous and employees are kind, but the shopping experience you create for the buyer has lost its charm and is now tainted in my book."
"NC","Review #1500!

I had to wait a while to write this review because this is where I ended up buying my fiancee's engagement ring.

I was in town for some training and staying at a hotel down the street so I thought I would check out what the US jewelry stores had to offer. 

After a couple minutes of browsing I was greeted and asked what I was looking for. She gave me a rundown of the basics about the store and their offerings of engagement rings. Then we got right into it. My fiancee had been pinning designs that she liked so I pulled up that list to help narrow things down. Once we had gone through all of the display cases I narrowed it down to four rings. 

We skipped past the pitch about diamonds as I had already heard it many times at other jewelry stores. Finally I grabbed all of the information on the four rings to be pleasantly surprised that the one I liked the best and the one I thought my fiancee would like was significantly discounted because it had been discontinued. 

I went back to my hotel to upload the options to the fiancee's Pinterest board and to do some research. After poking around on different websites and asking some sneaky questions to my fiancee I decided to go back and purchase the Neil Lane ring that had been discontinued. It turns out that there was almost the exact same ring still in production which was full price so I knew I'd be kicking myself later if I didn't snag this deal.

Upon returning to the store a few hours later, the staff member I was dealing with earlier was busy so I had a look around to see if I could find something to bring back for my lady as a gift that would throw her off the trail of me looking at rings.

During the purchase process I was informed that I would be getting a bunch of their reward points. This was perfect as I wanted to get something else for her, but the catch was that the points could only be used on certain designer brands. After looking at these, there was nothing that was in the price range that I wanted to spend on after the amount I spent on the ring. Later on in my trip I went to a different mall and bought her a Coach purse.

Overall I had a great experience here. The sales staff were very helpful and informative and went above and beyond to help me out in finding the right ring."
"NC","I've been in this store around 5 times in the past few months to pick out, personalize, and buy and engagement ring. The staff there are so friendly - and not in a fake, I just want your money friendly, but actually seemed to care about me as a customer. By the time the process was finished I was thrilled with my ring choice, and felt great about buying from this store. I would highly recommend going there for any jewelry purchases."
"NC","Popped in for a shiny bauble for Mrs. K. who deserves it for putting up with me and all of my nonsense. I take pictures of my food. I have to check-in at restaurants on my phone instead of talking with her. I mean, I'm a serious amount of work, you know!

The girl who helped me pick out what I wanted gave great service. I simply gave her an idea of how much I wanted to spend and what I wanted. She knew exactly which counter to head to. And yes, not everything here is a million dollars. There are inexpensive items.

Note: When you specify a price range, you'll want to add some windage for the service plan. It's not cheap."
"NC","Buyer beware. I had purchased my fiancé's engagement and wedding band from Jared and was pleased with everything. So my fiancé went to purchase me a watch for a wedding gift. The man sized the band for me and we left the store. The watch sat in the box for about 2 weeks until I tried it on again. I decided the watch wasn't for me and wanted to return it with in 30 days. My fiancé was running errands and tried to return it to the Concord store where they were rude and told he to come back to this store. Once she arrived the general manager was extremely rude and calling her a liar saying the watch was worn and he got a phone call from the Concord store ""warning him"" about my fiancé. We had to take our issue up with corporate and posting on their Facebook page we were finally able to return the watch. Beware once they get your money they will burn you on warranties and returns. Just go look at their Facebook page. It's nearly all complaints on it when other jewelry stores Facebook pages have not even half as many complaints. Stay away from this place."
"NC","Anything shiny grabs my attention immediately. I easily get distracted in Jared's. I went in to repair a bracelet I purchased over a year ago and I found myself lusting over case after case of jewelry.

Jared's offers great customer service. I purchased a couple items from one of their stores in Arizona and the location here was more than willing to help repair without charge. In both locations I've encountered very nice sales staff.

You cannot go wrong with buying me something at this store!"
"NC","Slow, absolutely the worst.  Horrible communication skills and customer service. I wouldn't imagine In million years how inconsiderate people in the auto business could be."
"NC","When I bought my vehicle two years ago, I decided to go to Precision for my car's routine oil change/tire rotations.  Not exactly sure why, maybe the coupons that come in, or that it is close to us, but I've had no problems dealing with them.

My only complaint, is they are always busy!  So people must like them, as I always have to wait.  This weekend I went late Saturday afternoon and had about a 1.5 hour wait for my oil change and tire rotation.  I have left work early to have this done as well, and it is still a long wait.  I think that is just part of the business no matter where you go though.  At least their waiting area is nice and comfortable with a clean bathroom!  I've had no problems walking around the adjacent shopping center while I wait as well.

I am also with Brian H. on the female manager.  She was there last year when I came in and I was not a fan of her, she wanted me to do more to my car than what was needed - I said no to all of that.  All the other times, including this time, I was told my car looked great.  I trust them there with my car, but definitely not her.

One more quick thing, make sure you get your key back for your tires if you have a rotation.  This last time they kept it and I turned right back around to get it.  Previously, I did not even notice they had kept it until I returned months later and it was not in my car, luckily they still had it.  I know they do not mean to do it on purpose, but they get so busy they forget something that could be so important if I get a flat tire. 

So far so good with my car!"
"NC","I stopped going to this location after the previous manager Tim was replaced with a female manager who in my opinion was not very friendly or willing to work with customers. I vowed not to return but I was in the area and really needed an oil change so I went by. To my surprise there was a new manager there named Brian who really took care of me and renewed my faith with precision tune. I felt like he was very knowledgable and seemed genuinely concerned with my vehicle and the services required. He was not pushy and prioritized the things needed for my car. I am glad Brian is there and will become a regular customer again."
"NC","Brought my girlfriends car in this morning to get a NC state inspection. I was greeted by Brian who was extremely friendly and helpful. He got me in and out of there in a half hour and gave me some good advice on my car and what needs to be serviced soon. I would recommend precision auto tune in pineville, NC to anyone who likes good quick service. Ask for Brian! Go Panthers!"
"NC","Will never go back. Was there 2 hours before closing for an oil change and was turned away because they did not have enough time.  I gladly took my business elsewhere."
"NC","This is a review of their business practices online.  

Essentially, a long time ago I started getting emails from this exact precision tune.  Someone there must have given my email as theirs, or the tech mis-typed it.  

DO NOT LET THEM HAVE YOUR EMAIL.. there is no way to get off the list.  I'm now taking actions to report their mis-handling in the case they send any more emails..

If you get stuck with their emails, contact their admin by searching 'whois ptautocare.com' and getting their email.  

Edit : They claim the link at the bottom will unsubscribe.  I clicked that thing many a time man... been getting emails for years from you, the Honda Dealership nearby, etc etc... FML"
"NC","Love these guy's.  I have been taking my car there since 2008.  First time I brought my car there was for an oil change.  Told Rod at the desk I needed cv joints because another mechanic said I did.  Well, I didn't, He however told me what I needed and took me in the shop and showed me every aspect of my car and his suggestions.  I was the first feel good experience I have had at a repair shop.  Rod has since gone and Tim has taken his place and he gives me the same customer service I have grown to love.  Keep it up guys!"
"NC","Great service - very quick, definitely use the coupons - and the evaluation was honest and fair - and no pressure is applied - I would go back again"
"NC","Arrived late with two tired kids- nice, clean room with comfortable beds. Very convenient location near a mall and restaurants (Brixx at Foxcroft is good).

Not a fan of having ""elite"" reserved parking spaces- Makes me envision mildly overweight guys in cheap suits and rented Chryslers with titanium Visa cards."
"NC","Arrived around midnight and the front desk was ready for us, check in was quick and we were able to turn in. The room was clean, bed comfy, the desk was huge...but the bathroom was small. Breakfast in the morning was very convenient, several choices, and the coffee hit the spot."
"NC","Visit this location several times before.
Food was fresh, prepared quickly. Service was friendly and helpful.
Dinning room...all the tables were dirty.
Food better than the normal burger chain so understand the slightly higher price.
Will come back"
"NC","There's a reason no one goes here. Service is horrible. Even with only 1 other person in the store the staff acts like their overwhelmed. How this location is still in business is some type of weird paradox. Don't bother to stop. You have been warned."
"NC","Usually a bit pricey for me but ordered the Farmhouse salad with roasted turkey and lt. Italian dressing at $4.99. Let me tell you that is a delicious salad and under 300 cal. with light dressing; can't go wrong. A bit slow getting it but that's due to them making it fresh."
"NC","Did not like it. Luke warm food that was not appetizing or tasteful. Not the cleanest establishment."
"NC","I didn't find the Chinese buffet all that, but the sushi is the best around. For the buffet price you get a WIDE variance of fresh made sushi. No committment to anything. Just as much as your tummy holds. I was skeptical at first but I go there often now. I went to sushi 101 tonite n was missing the buffet  And the ice cream at the end."
"NC","The sushi is great but the food on the bar is very average to below in my opinion. We very rarely come but sometimes brave the little food choice for some sushi. 

Tips:ask Tony at the sushi bar for a crazy roll! If you like egg drop soup you will want to skip it here, it's bland."
"NC","Great sushi ! Not so great waitress staff . Mostly cold expressions and unfriendly  attitudes . The sushi chefs are great ! Very friendly and always accommodating.  This is a great place to eat if you know how to pick and choose food - otherwise you may be very disappointed - soup is good - fruit is good and all you can eat sushi for 10.00 is definitely worth it - don't count on waitress to factor into the experience...You'll do fine . They will stand in your way- step out in front of you - and overall just stare like you are their enemy until time for the check, at which time they will quickly find time to get to you.  Two thumbs up on sushi and sushi chef  but two thumbs down on waitstaff"
"NC","Avoid this place.  Food was decent, but a lot of it was cold and did not taste fresh.  I tried the crab legs on the buffet, and as soon as I cracked them an ammonia smell was present.  
They had a lot of American dishes on the buffet as well, over salted and overall not that good.  
The other food was decent, but as I said before was cold.  
However, the sushi was decent, not the quality you expect at an actual sushi restaurant.  But the guy making made me a custom roll and was very nice about it.  

However, if you do come, just get the sushi, it's worth the price and just avoid the buffet."
"NC","This place is absolutely filthy. We were here last year and we decided never to go back but we thought we'd give it another try. Went for dinner tonight and was disgusted. There was old dried up rice under the tables against the wall just piled up. Wet napkins were wedged under our booth seats. Under the buffet lights, you can see splatter of food from the last decade. While I was eating, a waitress emptied plates into some bus boy buckets and some fell on the floor and she kicked it under the cart! Tons of garbage and food under these carts. Blech!! Then all the food was cold and hard. Bathroom was a hellhole. No idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way."
"NC","As I am not a sushi fan, I cannot attest to who is a good or bad employee when it comes to preparation.  My Dad dabbles a bit, and on one visit as he was at the sushi bar, he offered a tip to the preparer who then quickly pointed to which sushi he should get because it was ""the freshest.""  Hmm...

I had lunch today because I had a coupon.  I always try never to be seated in the booths to the left of the buffet as you walk in as there is just too much employee foot traffic to negotiate.  Don't get me wrong, I like attentive service, but it was frustrating trying to get out of the booths and to the bar having to dodge the roving waitresses constantly up and down the aisle and, if not moving, firmly planting themselves in the aisle right where access from the buffet and booths are.  There was also little effort to move so customers could freely move about.

As far as the food, nothing exceptional stood out to me.  The ""house special"" chicken was alright once removing the skin which had a rubbery consistency.  The grilled shrimp were flavorless with no seasoning or grilled flavor making hot sauce or salt a necessity.

Other dishes were as expected with temperature being reasonable for a buffet.  What brings me back are their BBQ chicken wings which really should be labeled as hot wings for those not knowing they have some kick.  Not like wings you'd find at wing restaurants like BWW and a little small, but, hey, you can get as many as you want!

I ended my meal with some soft serve ice cream.  After circling the buffet a few times, I found my only options were to use a soup cup or have a cone as they had no dessert dishes.  Either they don't offer them or all were being washed.

The machine dispensed really fast, and all the cups were freshly washed (read this as still hot) so I luckily found a coffee saucer to put my cup under so I didn't drip all the way back to my seat.  Again, after nearly crawling over employees set up almost as obstacles to the customer, I had a few spoons of my now almost entirely melted serving in which I had little interest in trying to get another serving.

China Buffet is a little expensive for lunch even with a coupon.  I guess if I loved sushi this would be a great value.  I definitely will go again when I have a coupon but be firm in where I wish to be seated as the booths are just too big of a hassle when trying to get to the buffet and around the army of employees."
"NC","the price is great for the variety of food.... Love the sushi bar in the back...."
"NC","No complaints. While the Chinese food options were the usual chicken in sauce or fried bits of meat in batter, the sushi table was clean and fresh with a reasonable selection. Better than most others in the Charlotte area."
"NC","We have always left most Chinese buffets feeling all bloated with all the sodium but we did not have that problem here. Other than that it is your typical Chinese buffet. Good flavor with plenty to select from. Could have been a little cleaner but I see with the amount of people there that it would be hard to keep up with especially with all the kids. All in all it was good and we would go back."
"NC","Not very good. Dried out food. Some things cold, when they should be hot. Disappoined overall. Not clean, either. 11.99 per person not worth it."
"NC","Very large buffet. They have sushi, too, I even ate a whole squid thingy. Not bad. You can definitely find SOMETHING you like there. And a plus, they have mee fun, which I find very rarely at a Chinese place. Mostly they have lo mein or something."
"NC","I've been coming to China Buffet for approximately 10 years now. When I first moved to Pineville in 2001 this was just somewhere close to eat cheaply. At that time they did not have the sushi chef.

The Chinese Buffet:
Nothing to write home about. Nothing here is truly worth mentioning. Just your standard Chinese buffet fare mostly covered i thick, syroupy sauces and probably very unhealthy. Nothing is particularly good but nothing is particularly bad either.

The Sushi Buffet:
This is why you want to come here (unless you're a sushi snob because no matter what you''re just not gonna be happy)! All you can eat sushi for around $10 (which also includes the Chinese buffet portion but let's pretend it doesn't for the heck of it). This is pretty unbeatable given that the sushi is freshly made throughout the day. Yes, I do agree that the presentation plates could be wiped off between servings on the fried pieces with heavy sauces but not all their offering has tick coatings of sauces. So, in my case, I don't eat those. I like them... but I chose to eat the ones that are not covered in thick sauces and look more presentable.

Tony, the sushi chef (I don't know the other guys'  name but thank god he's rarely if ever there) is really cool. He's very engaging with his customers, he remembers your name and your family. He greets you openly and warmly and is always ready to offer suggestions on new things to try. Remember to tip him well even if you don't touch the Chinese food (I usually don't, except for the egg drop soup)

The staff is very serviceable and are constantly refilling your glass and cleaning your table. They speak very little English but enough to understand what you want should you be the pesky customer who needs everything customized in a buffet style restaurant. Unfortunately, as someone else say, they do have the very rude tendency of always getting in the way and NEVER giving the customer the right of way. They cut in front of you and make you stop or go around them instead of them doing so for the customer. This is what knocked one star.

Obviously the staff has changed through the years. I remember a couple of waitresses throughout the years that were really nice and helpful. They got to know my little girls and tried teaching them how to eat with chop sticks. So, my, and Becky's, kids all love it here. This is definitely a good place to take children since they can pretty much try a bunch of things without worrying about not liking it (This is, after all, where my, at the time, 5 year old fell in love with Ikura). The owner, although in all the time I've been going has never once acknowledged that I am a regular (sometimes twice to three times a month) regular, seems rather unfriendly and, actually, kinda sour. I don't know if he is or not... but he doesn't seem very welcoming, warm or friendly. Not that it bothers me, I don't care, I'm there to eat... but I noticed it.

The decor is a mix of traditional chinese with some modern lighting and tacky foreign cluelessness (yes, I just made all that up but when you see it it'll make sense). And the place is very clean except for the ice cream machine which doesn't get enough TLC from the staff.

This is a great place to come and have lunch once in a while if you work in the area or have kids who want to try Chinese or have sushi lovers (not snobs) who want good sushi for free. But this is not the type of place that you will be making special trips to visit. Try to avoid dinner as it gets rather expensive without any appreciable additions to the buffet."
"NC","Absolute best price for quality sushi, and well worth the quick drive from Rock Hill. Tony is a fantastic sushi chef, and an extremely nice guy, to boot. He is definitely the reason my wife and I come back so often, but the variety and quality of the buffet is great, too."
"NC","A pretty standard Chinese buffet.  The have a nice seafood selection, mussels, fish, shrimp, crab, etc.  I wasn't adventurous to try it but they had octopus.  They also had sushi, but I'm not a sushi fan so I didn't try it so I can't say much about it.  They also had the standard Americanized dishes too.  They did a good job of bringing out fresh food.  Like any buffet the quality is going to suffer over a sit down place, but I like the variety.  Not the greatest Chinese buffet I've ever eaten at, but China Buffet is pretty decent."
"NC","Ugh...don't waste your time or your money!  I would have given it zero stars but the Mei Fun and the Pepsi were actually decent.  

The buffet has the typical Chinese fair but the only thing I could come close to suggesting would be the fried shrimp, Mei Fun, and maybe the sweet and sour chicken.  Skip everything else!!!!

Don't even think about eating the sushi.  I was feeling adventurous so I grabbed a few of the sushi rolls that I easily recognized (california, cucumber).  One of them tried to crawl off the plate before I got back to my seat!  The rolls were chewy and just plain gross, makes my stomach turn to think about it.

Service was polite and good on the refills.

Enter at your own risk!"
"NC","Definately will pick this buffet place over Tin Tin for these reasons:

-price is worth what you pay for and will cost less then Tin Tin
-less variety, more quality food
-great sushi selection, you will find sushi rolls at this place that you will not find at other chinese buffets and you won't be disappointed! The sushi here are way more quality then other places. 
-I love their seafood stir fry dish with the shrimp and crab meat. 
-love their jello! 
-great service, they are always refilling your drink (sometime way sooner then you want them to)"
"NC","Reasonable pricing for all you can eat. Delicious Chinese food. The sushi is Great! Tony is a real friendly guy. He'd make exactly what you ask for and pretty quick too. He even remembered my sister who haven't been here in over two months."
"NC","Blech.  I think I must have been at a different buffet than these other reviewers, because this was horrible.  When we walked in, it was like we were in the South Pacific.  Seriously.  The thermostat must have been set at 90.  A nice change from the 40 degree weather outside, but after about three minutes, it was the worst.  Maybe that's for atmosphere, but it was not enjoyable.

To make the experience even less appetizing, the place is cramped and the staff does not help at all in this regard - they are constantly in the middle of the aisles, writing tickets and getting drinks in the middle of the walking areas and the like.  Again, they could be going for atmosphere, and having the staff constantly around is nice, but with overbearing heat and little room to move it's not good.  It's bad.  Really bad.  If you don't like personal space, you're good.  Really good even.  Otherwise, it stinks.  Literally.  I've been to restaurants in big cities, where rent is outrageous, that have more room to move than this.  In Pineville, there ought to be all sorts of elbow room (Schoolhouse Rock anyone?).

Yes, there is a sushi bar where a guy makes it in front of you.  Let me first tell you that I'm not really a sushi guy.  I like California rolls and those little rice cakes with shrimp on them, and a few other things, but none of the more exotic stuff.  But this was nasty.  He would take a big fried thing and plop it down on a plate and squirt some heavy mayo-like sauce all over it.

That's not too bad, right?  Well, once the rolls were gone, he'd do it again - without cleaning the plate.  That's right, there was a buildup of this mayo on the platter.  Several varieties, all right there under the lights.  It was pretty sickening.  Like a sushi hog pond.

On the regular buffet, it wasn't too bad, but it wasn't that good either.  If you want a Southern food buffet (meat, rolls, corn), it's okay.  But the Chinese food was just average.  Add that to the place, the staff, the price - go elsewhere.  China King and Dragon House aren't far away, and Tin Tin is just up the street (though I'm not a huge fan of Tin Tin either).  You'll have a much nicer experience."
"NC","One of the bigger and better Chinese feed troughs in the area.  Like so many others, it's just a massive amount of average tastes.  The one thing you cannot question is the value proposition.  Go have lunch, and waddle back to the car."
"NC","Stay Away!  They damaged my car. If I were you I would not risk taking my car or any other vehicle to auto bell."
"NC","Great service and staff! If you need your car washed right, this is your spot. New special for $4 wash! No better place!"
"NC","I am usually reluctant to complain, but....
Today I paid $29.99 for ""managers special"" which included the works.  Poor job.  Carpets poorly vacuumed, exterior of car still had dirt on it, leather seats not cleaned properly, and the console was filled with water.   Armor-all protectant all over the place and not wiped down properly.  Air freshener that smells like urinal cake.  Pleasant staff, but poor quality work."
"NC","Energetic young folk zooming around to make our cars nice and clean."
"NC","Stay away from this AAMCO! They have the worst customer service EVER! 
We purchased a Groupon to have our tires rotated and a fuel injection service performed, made an appointment and showed up 10 minutes early only to be informed that they were an hour behind. I even called before I went there to see if maybe there was a cancellation so maybe I cold get in and out earlier. The person who answered the phone, Tasha, didn't say anything about them being behind. Had she said so, I would have waited 45 minutes before going there. Turns out I sat there for almost 3 hours! NOT GOOD! Then when it was time for me to check out, she tried to charge me $3.52  for 'shop materials'. Well, I happen to have worked in a shop and a couple of shop towels doesn't cost $3.52. So I picked up my car keys and left. Next I will be contacting Groupon about this shady business."
"NC","Went for a basic oil change and was out within half an hour!  The service was very friendly,  I plan on going back."
"NC","I started going here when I purchased a Living Social for some oil changes, but will now  be a lifetime customer.  Their customer service is amazing and they are incredibly reasonable on price.  Great place."
"NC","I'm definitely a fan of the Hilton Garden Inn.  This is my 2nd time staying at Hilton Garden Inn (not this specific one).  Both experiences were great.  The room here was clean, and the staff was friendly.  The one downside - the hotel did not seem to control the temperature very well.  The lobby was cool and comfortable at first, but if you stayed there you quickly started to freeze.  If you went up to your room, the hallways leading to the rooms were like a sauna.  Otherwise, I had no issues with this hotel, and would stay there again if I was visiting Charlotte."
"NC","Stayed here for 2 nights in the whirlpool suite. We paid in advanced so we received an additional $20 a night savings. Location is surrounded by several stores and restaurants. Hotel is very clean & plenty of things to do here to make your stay enjoyable. At $99 a night for a whirlpool suite, which isn't a bad price for a Hilton.  On the downside, there are signs of aging to the hotel. For example wall paper pealing & even though room was spotless, the room did lack maintenance. Curtain was coming loose from the curtain rod, ethernet port was pushed into the wall so it was inaccessable, and iron in room was partially broken. We also tried to utilize room service by calling them from 9:10pm - 9:45pm and the phone stayed busy making it obvious it was off the hook since room service stops serving @ 10pm."
"NC","Stayed 1 night for business purposes.  Checked in, worked in the hotel room in the evening, slept, and checked out the next day.  Good hotel for a business (not sure why else anyone would be in the Pineville area). Good desk set up in the room with an ergonomic chair and free high-speed.  Comfortable bed with 2 different types of pillow - one is fluffy down and the other is a microfiber polyester pillow mimic down.  The mattress is part of the Garden Sleep System which allows each guest to adjust the firmness on their side of the bed.    Wish I read the room guide earlier in the evening - apparently there's a Stay Fit Kit that we could bring to our room for a bit of working out in the room.    It has a pool and a workout room so I could definitely see myself staying here longer (for business purposes) as there would be no excuse to not keep up with current fitness routine

Company paid for the room so I'm not sure what the rate was.  There is not a lot going on in the area. Definitely lots of restaurants and fast food within driving distances, such as Tony Roma, Chili, IHOP.  Given that I was alone, I was hoping to find a grocery store (like Whole Foods or Safeway) for their hot bar but I found a bi-lo which was not what I was expecting.  

The only thing holding this place back from a 5 star is that the common area looks like it is starting to age (emphasis on the starting to look age as everything is still clean, tidy, and organized).  However, if the average price is $124, than for that rate, it could definitely be a 5 star.

I would stay here again."
"NC","My vehicle was failed state inspection because of a claim I was missing specific emission equipment. So I went to the dealership to pickup the missing parts and the dealership informed me that my vehicle has never had the emissions parts in question."
"NC","Just left there and my car was inspected quickly and no hidden costs.  The staff was efficient and quick and that's all I can ask."
"NC","This is not my favorite place to get my car inspected. It is certainly not that clean, the employees are not friendly but the inspection only took 15 minutes and I passed. They tried to sell my some fluids and light bulbs, etc. I had some fluids in my back seat and asked them to help me and they refused. Probably wont be back."
"NC","I've taken my car here at least twice. Both times it failed on a defective license bulb.
Not the biggest problem in the world of maintenance but they charged me $8 to screw it in.

If you get your car tested here, I would recommend checking your bulbs first and if they say they need to be replaced, buy the bulb from them but screw it in yourself."
"NC","This is the only place I take my vehicles to get inspected.  

This is all they do- inspections. They do not do oil, do not change tires, they do not try to sell you a car.....they just do inspections.

Normally it does not take more than 15 minutes or so to do an inspection here, as they do have three bays open, and the staff is friendly.

The waiting room is small, a small tv in the corner, and lots of magazines, to choose from.  Since it is only a few minutes for the inspection.....it is hard to complain about the chairs, or the limited tv channels, and most people tend to sit outside while they wait.

I am glad they only do inspections, it just makes it easy to have the same place do it year after year, without the hassle of someone trying to sell you things you do not need.

"NC","My car broke down the other night and a friend told me I should have it towed to Buffalo Tire.  Being in a jam, I had it towed there only to later find out that it had changed ownership and become Tire Kingdom.  I read the reviews online and my heart sank as most of them seemed to be negative... not a good feeling when you seem ""forced"" to use their services.   

My experience has been all positive.  Robert has been professional and thorough, keeping me informed throughout the whole process.  I explained my hesitancy to do business there because of the poor reviews and he was very sympathetic and explained the situation.  Apparently, the store has had 11 different managers in a 2 year period and he was hired specifically to turn things around.   So far, he's doing a great job.  I would definitely give this store an opportunity for your business.   

I don't work here, am not related to anyone here and have nothing to gain by posting this.  I just want to see people trying hard to do right and be honest get the support and business they need."
"NC","If I could give 0 stars for this business I would!  Was totally ripped off!!!
Took my car in to have NC Inspection.  While waiting, I could hear yelling coming from the service area.  After waiting 35-40 minutes the manager,  Will, came out and told me my car did not pass inspection and I needed new tires for it to pass. ( I had already been told by another employee they were fine).  I told Will that and he said 
""well they won't pass for NC"". I left without buying tires.  Went around the corner to another place of business and had my car inspected and it passed! No problems with the tires. Later  in the afternoon I received a car from the gentleman that does the state inspections for this Tire Kingdom.  He apologized to me and told me my car was really okay to pass inspection including the tires but his boss, Will, had told him to fail me so I would buy tires.  Inspector refused to fail me since it really was ok and that is what all the yelling I heard from the service area was about. He told me he could not go on knowing that I had been  cheated. He said he had to do what his boss said even though he is the one that is certified to do the inspections- NOT WILL.  Kudos for an honest person there even though the manager is a crook.  I made a complaint to Corporate and have had several conversations with someone 
from Corp.  They admitted Will was wrong and should not have done that!   

HOWEVER, Will is still the manager there so BEWARE!  

I was taken advantage of by  this business just so Will could sell some tires.  What does it say about the company that keeps someone like this on as an employee and especially as a manager!!???   
ANOTHER BEWARE- I went on Better Business Bureau  site to file a complaint.  You may want to read about this company on the BBB site before you think about doing business with them."
"NC","I used to only take both my vehicles here when it was buffalo Tire, the service was friendly and the work was good... 

Overall the attitude you get from these guys at tire kingdom is that you are bothering them if you have a question, and you should just pay them whatever they say with no explanation, they make you feel uncomfortable and unwelcome and are just plain rude.  

Since they've Changed to Tire Kingdom the place has gone WAY down hill.  The last time I went there was for an oil change... 
The first day (Friday) I showed up around 12 O'clock there were 2 techs standing outside and two cars parked there... I asked the techs if they could do an oil change and he said no come back tomorrow around 9am
Showed up the second day (Saturday) and the place was packed... after waiting for an hour to get my car in, one of the guys came back and asked where I had my last oil change because they had completely stripped the bolt on the oil pan.  I told them it was done there and showed them the paper work.  Because it was a weekend they could not get the part and asked if I could come back Monday.  I said no problem and asked if I needed an appointment they said no we will get you in just come after 10 because they needed to get the part from the dealer ...
Showed up Monday around 11 and they had not gotten the part, once I got there they sent someone to get it.... 4 hours or so later (had time to walk to the mall, eat, walk around and get back before my car was pulled in) my oil change was done, then the tech proceeded to tell me that my rear brakes needed to be done and quoted me $780 for that... I didn't get the brakes done there, but I did have to pay full price for my 3 day oil change... $80 and not even one apology for the trouble. (I'm not the type of person to get bent out of shape about stuff I understand these things happen... bottom line is if they had apologized and maybe gave me a discount, especially for a repeat customer then I am sure I would still be getting my cars serviced there).

I took my car to a shop around the corner and they did my brakes for about half the price I was quoted.   

I will never go back here after taking my vehicles here for years, I feel sorry for Tommy he knows what customer service is.  It's a-shame his management and co-workers have no clue.

If you have a foreign car I would recommend Independence auto around the corner on south blvd they act like they actually appreciate your business and they do a good job"
"NC","Closed. It's now tire kingdom. They knew the difference between a regular crown Vic and my police interceptor.  Which is awesome and a surprise. Although the prices was almost double of another store (discount tire). Very knowledgeable and polite."
"NC","Great prices, Tommy gives very thorough customer service. Small waiting room with a TV and free WiFi."
"NC","I have never actually been there in person, but I have caught some of it on live-streaming.  And I know Todd and Tracie and they are two of the most genuine, interesting, intelligent, and kind people I have ever known.  I live in Chicago, so I rarely get to see them, but when I do, the conversations are EPIC and can go late into the night, touching on things you would never even think of with anyone else.  Everyone should have people like them in their lives.  
Also, I love coffee.  If you love coffee, you should TOTALLY go check it out.  And if you hate coffee, I am sure they've still got ya covered.  Because that is just the kind of people they are."
"NC","Love this place.  Great music, good coffee, friendly staff.  Great place to go and hang out, talk with people and relax.  Highly recommended.  Also, check out their worship services, when they're not just a coffee house!"
"NC","Coffee Houses need bands and be a place for people to MEET, relax, have fun and have open discussions.  If the Coffee and Hot Chocolate are GREAT that adds to the experience but not that much for me.  When I look for a Coffee House this is what I want!!!  Check their website for upcoming events, like Bands and new music release parties.

This is a COZY, comfortable place, though bigger than it looks from the outside."
"NC","The chillest coffeehouse to hang out in the Charlotte area. It's a Church setting with the best coffee and hot chocolate known to man (seriously.) and the people are great. Most recently I saw Flowers for Faye play and there were about 20 people there, not to crowded, and very comfortable. If you're looking for a comfy Friday or Saturday night just hanging out and drinking awesome coffee, The Well Church and Coffeehouse is the best place to be."
"NC","Good clean restaurant - manager is hands on and aware of customers and kitchen staff. I sat near kitchen so it was loud - my order was steak and eggs with steak medium - came to me with well done steak - manager immediately fixed it - 
For lower than expected expectation the experience didn't disappoint - 
If your hungry for breakfast food it is a good place to go . 
The waitress was not much help and really apparently non existent . The check was left on my table way too early and so was she ... 
Don't go in with too high expectations and you'll do fine ..."
"NC","Food was very salty. I think I'm bout to have a heart attack. God took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten. Anyhoo I was so hungry I ignored the salty food and scarfed it down. There seasonal fruit contained 3 canned pineapples and 2 canned grapes."
"NC","Michelle is our server this evening.  I ordered a mushroom spinach burger with fries and an unsweetened tea. Unsurprisingly nothing had any flavor. The service was pretty bad as well. A shame really,  I was looking forward to chatting with Matt, but he was sent home early because it was dead. When we left there were at least 30 people there."
"NC","So I'm having the bacon and white cheddar melt on artisan sourdough bread and it's amazing! The most amazing thing about it is that it has no distinct taste other than the eggs. The seasoned fries are seasoned with salt I believe. They taste good. The grilled sourdough bread has the strangest scent. It reminds me of freshly drying paint.
My wife ordered the new quesadillas. She's fully consumed one with no snide comments flying so it must be good."
"NC","It's IHOP. I'm still alive. 

Food is good. Large selection of food from breakfast (Crazy huge omelets!) to dinner. Sometimes hard to make a quick decision."
"NC","I ordered the all you can eat pancakes and four sausage links. Coty is our server though Matt & Cindy are here too. Everything was fine. It definitely was better than Waffle House."
"NC","Go there every other Thursday for my life group bible study and they are excellent with their customer service and the food is great and they know what I want when I get there and keeps sweet tea on my table. They like us being there b/c of what we do and stand for."
"NC","(9-14-13) Had a new server Nikki this evening. Spring  & Tiffany left this location. Only Matt & Cindy remain from the old crew. The food was good. I had a cheese burger & onion rings with sweet tea.

(10-3-13) We once again dined at Ihop. I had a one year anniversary certificate from the online Ihop club. I got an omelet & pumpkin pancakes. Matt was our server & the food was great!"
"NC","As far as IHops go, 5 stars. Super friendly service, Kay was awesome. Carolyn at check out was great too. Got my free birthday meal and just substituted it for something of equal value. Delicious breakfast and really quick."
"NC","(7/14/13) Spring is our server this evening. I had the all you can eat pancakes & my wife had chicken wings. Everything was good."
"NC","(6/29/2013) Both Spring and Tiffany are working tonight. The restaurant is sort of full for nearly 2300. I ordered a spinach & mushroom omelet, sausage links & buttermilk pancakes. My wife had the chicken fajita quesadillas & onion rings. Everything was great! The surprise at the end was special. Tiffany, Spring & Cindy gave me an ice cream sundae & sang happy birthday to me! All in all a very good evening."
"NC","(6/16/13) Its time to use my free birthday coupon. Argh, the menus have changed again. According to Spring the prices have gone up an average of 0.20 across the board. The new menus also are missing the side items for non breakfast foods. The pictures for each dish are closer to the ways that the dishes actually look rather than some corporate artist's fantasy.

I had an omelet with red velvet pancakes & sweet tea. It was good, comfort food that hit the spot better than Red Robin did."
"NC","(5/24/13) Spring is our server this evening.  I ordered a cheeseburger and a side of onion rings. It was good. My wife ordered chicken tenders. The food was good but average. We mainly go to iHop to people watch & hang out with the staff. All in all a good evening."
"NC","I ordered the ultimate bacon and sausage platter with all you can eat pancakes. Spring is our server. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there but slowly started to attract people as we ate. I suppose that most people don't see IHop as a Mother's Day destination which was good because it was very easy to get a table. The food would't win any awards but it hit the spot & the dinner show was always good."
"NC","(4/14/13) I ordered an appetizer sampler and my wife ordered chicken strips this evening. The presentation wasn't awesome nor was the food artfully arranged but it was hot & delicious!"
"NC","Cedric is our server. A nice polite young man. I ordered a breakfast sampler. The restaurant is absolutely packed this morning. The food was hot & delivered promptly. Cedric was a great server I'd be happy to have him serve us again."
"NC","New menus at ihop means higher prices! Wonderful. It seems that everything on the menu has gone up by at least $1.00 across the board. I had a Country Omelet with a side of Red Velvet Pancakes. The omelet was uninspired. It had no flavor whatsoever. Thank God for ketchup! The red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them.  THey were brown on the outside & an odd shade of dark pink on the inside. They also were flavorless but they had some sickeningly sweet cream cheese flavored paste drizzled all over them. Then the stack was topped with whipped cream. Whipped cream? Really? Maybe that goes over well with children but for an adult its a little creepy. The accompanying dinner theater provided by other diners & the sweet tea were the highlights of the meal.

The other strange thing about iHop is that the food never comes out hot, only warm. I think the grills are just for show. I think that they warm everything in an Easy Bake oven under a 10watt bulb."
"NC","Colorado omelette time! It looked interesting on the menu & I thought let's try it. So much of iHop's menu is bland & boring. The Colorado omelette is the meat lovers omelette according to Tiffany. It has bacon, sausage & regrettably pot roast.

Unlike the pot roast that is served as a stand alone meal the pot roast in the Colorado omelette is actually moist & tasteless. I found the entirety of it repulsive but managed to choke down about a third of it. I left the rest on the plate vowing to never try it again. As it happened it was taken off our bill. The pancakes are great as always.

Ihop gets three stars for the service & the servers not the nasty omelette."
"NC","Okay, I know this is just an IHOP, so I shouldn't expect culinary excellence.  

But.

We've been to this location a couple times.  They do breakfast VERY well.  Their coffee is always fresh and hot.  Their pancakes are always fresh and hot.  Their orange juice is never too tart, never too sweet.  I've never found foreign items in my food.  Wait staff is always courteous and helpful.

But.

Beware - when you order NON-breakfast items, you may not end up with a satisfying meal.  This past weekend I took my daughter and my grandmother to the IHOP for a quick & cheap post-church lunch.  My grandmother ordered coffee and a belgian waffle - she said it was very delicious.  My daughter got the baby cakes kids meal, and she ate most of it.  I made the mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and corn on the side.  The chicken fried steak was so tough as to be inedible (I took a couple bites and left the rest).  The mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning.  I took one bite and when I realized I was eating aged potatoes, I left the rest.  The corn was the best thing on the plate.  Needless to say when we got home I made myself a sandwich since I didn't really get lunch at the IHOP. *lol*

As I said, we've been to this location before, and they definitely do breakfast right (which makes sense given what an IHOP is).  My daughter and grandmother were very satisfied with their meals.  But stick with the breakfast menu.  Don't venture anywhere near the non-breakfast menu.  Then you should be fine."
"NC","This place is empty tonight. Spring is the only server. Tiffany is here too but she looks terrible. I ordered the 3 eggs, 3 pancakes with 4 sausage links. Hopefully it will be good. And... It was just fine. Not the best by any means but good food."
"NC","For an IHOP, the Pineville location is as good as it gets!

What do I mean ""for an IHOP""?  It's a fast food franchise, whose claim to fame are their fast, and (fairly) inexpensive, breakfasts.  Frame your expectations accordingly, and you won't be disappointed.

We're especially fond of the night crew: (Spring, Tracy, and Tiffany); each are not only friendly and efficient, but they're funny as hell.

For as much as I might enter this location with a frown, I walk out with a smile each time, and it isn't the pancakes. It isn't that they're bad...it's just that they're standard IHOP fare.

The dining area is consistently clean; servers are great, the pancakes are pretty good, and fairly inexpensive.  This is a place for breakfast, but not much else."
"NC","I'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the French onion pot roast. I can safely say that I will never order either again. The soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt. The pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever. It was tender but the mushrooms and carmelized onions were not in evidence. To make matters worse the corn was flavorless and the mashed potatoes had no butter. Tiffany failed as our server tonight but Tracey stepped up and refreshed our drinks and brought me melted butter and grilled onions."
"NC","My wife asked me if I wanted to go to iHop tonight and naturally I said yes. I have to protect my dukedom. I ordered the country sausage potatoes, pumpkin pancakes & grits. It will probably be good. Their grill guy is pretty consistent in turning out good food. There are quite a few people here for a Saturday night. Well the food was barely warm. Not an auspicious start to the meal. Cold grits aren't a treat. All in all I wondered why we bothered going.

We went to iHop for brunch today 11/5/12 around noon & had Katrina as our server. It wasn't the best meal as far as service was concerned. I had to call her back to the table to refill my drink. Apparently my empty glass wasn't enough of a visual cue. The meal itself was average, a bacon cheeseburger with fries and sweet tea. I don't think of iHop as a lunchtime destination and I probably never will."
"NC","The service was very friendly, but the food wasn't all that good. Most everything tasted like it had been sitting around for quite a while before being plated. Especially the potatoes. Not sure I would return."
"NC","It's an absolute nightmare of people tonight. I had the jack cheddar potatoes with pumpkin pancakes and extra meat. Matt was my server. He forgot the larger plate for the pancakes. Tracey dyed her hair jet black! All in all good dinner theater and average food. When I was on my way out the door I encountered a group of teens involved with saving some girl's soul from the devil. Definitely an odd night."
"NC","The place is hopping tonight. Matt, Bina, Tiffany and Tracey are working tonight. Apparently Scarowinds is providing lots of late night traffic. There are a lot of teens here tonight and the ever watchful Pineville police officer. I ordered the ultimate Bacon something or other with pumpkin pancakes and a sweet tea. I hope its filling. I'm pretty hungry tonight. As it turned out I ate it all & it was really good. It didn't look anything like the menu though they really need to work on presentation."
"NC","Even though the place is almost empty there are still enough people to watch. I'm going to order the all you can eat pancakes. My wife ordered wings and a house salad. Apparently 7pm is the dinner hour for older Charlotteans. The front of the restaurant was almost full. Service was slow but there were only two servers Matt & Tiffany. Tracey was the night manager. We go there to hang out & kill a few hours so slow service doesn't matter really to us anymore. The thing I really hate is the way that the food is presented. It looks nothing like it does on the menu."
"NC","Matt is our server tonight. I ordered a Bacon cheeseburger and a sweet tea with onion rings as the side. My wire ordered some breakfast thing. There are five people in here including us. We'd hoped for more dinner theater, alas."
"NC","Spring is our waitress. We went down so that my wife could get her free birthday entree. She had all you can eat pancakes. I had a short stack of pancakes with sausage, bacon, eggs & grits. The food was filling but average. 

Spring & Matt were the only servers. Bob was manager that night. Ihop is still good comfort food."
"NC","Josh is awesome!! Great server. Get the ayce pancakes. Yum!"
"NC","It's fairly crowded tonight. I keep asking myself why on earth I would want to eat here on my birthday. The only reason I could think of was that the servers are really entertaining. Its a good place to people watch and that night there were certainly a lot of different people to observe. Spring was our server tonight. I had pancakes with hot maple syrup & a sweet tea. I guess iHop pancakes are one of my comfort foods. I've never had a bad pancake at iHop."
"NC","Tonight we're seated close to the kitchen. There's a bunch of adult children seated around us. Bob is the manager tonight and Spring is our server. Matt is also serving tonight. He's as dour as he normally is. I ordered a sweet tea while my wife ordered a pepsi. I'm using a birthday coupon for a free entree for chocolate chip pancakes. Spring brought me an ice cream sundae on the house! She said they would sing happy birthday to me but I told them not to bother. The food was good. We had a good time."
"NC","My wife & I were back at iHop in Pineville this evening. The restaurant was pretty empty. The manager told us that it was very full a couple hours ago because Tuesday night is kids eat free night. My wife had chicken & waffles & I had a new menu item the chicken fajita quesadilla with a side of onion rings. My wife inhaled her meal. I worked my way through mine. Ihop makes really good onion rings so it was a treat to eat there tonight."
"NC","Spring seated us in the back section tonight.  We both settled for sweet tea. My wife ordered biscuits and gravy. I ordered a spinach and mushroom omelet with a side of buttermilk pancakes and sausage. I ate all the pancakes and most of the omelet. I think I should just stick to pancakes. Tonight we met the crazy crack lady. She appeared at our booth to inform us that her Lincoln had a leaky fuel line & what were we going to do about it? Since all the garages were closed for the evening I suggested that she talk with Tracey the manager. Tracey handed her off to someone else & she slowly started to make the rounds of the customers in the restaurant. Tracey let us out a side door in the kitchen to get away from her. LOL."
"NC","We were greeted by Tracy the manager who decided to serve us along with our faithful waitress Sky. We sat in our usual booth & had a couple sweet teas. My wife had wings and a salad. I had a burger without the bacon interwoven into it. Overall it was a good meal with a lot of iHop gossip being passed along."
"NC","We went to iHOP this evening. Spring was out so we got served by Bob the manager. We both had sweet tea and ham & egg melts with fries. Everything was good. Bob is a good waitress. He was prompt with our drink refills."
"NC","My wife and I had great service from Spring when we ate here a few nights ago. We always ask for either her or Tiffany. Unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that I ordered for dinner were foul. The steak was either overcooked or it was bordering on raw. Thank Gods for the fluffy buttermilk pancakes & hot maple syrup. Without them I'd have gone hungry that night.

You might wonder why we continue to eat there given the plethora or marginal experiences, well it is very cheap & its closer to the house than driving down to Carrowinds to go to Cracker Barrel."
"NC","My son and I love going to IHOP for breakfast. Well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations. The restaurant had about 10 tables empty and we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated. My guess is they were understaffed. 

Once we did get seated, service was slow and really bad. I had to ask 4 times for silverware, 3 times for a straw for my sons cup, and the food just wasn't that good. My plate was dirty. My son asked for strawberries on his pancakes and they had blueberry syrup on them - I wonder who's plate they scraped them off of. 

Oh and the straw came as we were paying. Not our best IHOP experience."
"NC","iHop is one of our favorite restaurants for late night suppers. We prefer not to go when the rest of the area eats. Our experiences there have been mixed. Servers that I can recommend are Spring & Tiffany who will go the extra distance to make sure you have plenty to drink & refresh your hot maple syrup.

Unfortunately we have also had servers who think that making you wait 1/2 hour or more for your check is the way to win a big tip. In that instance the server never returned & we had the meal comped by the manager who told us that she had gone across the street for baby formula. As we were leaving she was pulling up. Another server told me that the reason we had to wait so long to leave was because she had to go to the bathroom. On one of our most recent visits our server told us that the reason that our food was cold, that we got no drink refills, that he couldn't give us our check in a timely manner was because he was "" running around like a chicken with his head cut off.""

My wife had ordered cheese soup & a sandwich when we had the chicken as a waiter. The soup came out cold & it resembled snot. The manager took it off our bill.

On our last visit the manager served us herself & it was a great meal with excellent service. I like iHop because its cheap & you get decent sized portions. I love the all you can eat pancakes even though I can never eat more than a single plate. 

If you're worried about shenanigans dining there late at night don't worry. Pineville stations an officer there from 12am - 5am."
"NC","IHOP is IHOP... it's great for it's consistency wherever you go.  Usually when I hit up IHOP it's on the weekends and you end up fighting the crowds, but if you time it just right... your IHOP experience can be a good one.

This experience recently on a Saturday happened to be after a 4 mile run so we were super super hungry.  I was pleasantly surprised since they offer some new healthy options.  I had the wheat french toast combo with turkey bacon and scrambled egg beater eggs.  Not too bad for 490 calories.  Good way to start the day."
"NC","Absolutely authentic Japanese grocery store in the town. Japanese food only!  This is not a big store, but I can find almost 90% things I need to cook.  I love their frozen fishes, variety choice at a reasonable price.  I love their frozen tofu stuffs and frozen fish balls. I put these for my homemade hot pot.  They also have some vegetables and snacks. They are at Westinghouse in Pineville, I just drive 5 more minutes after I take exit 65B."
"NC","this place is fantastic! for a long time, i had been driving all the way to the large asian market on independence. and i prolly will still stop there every once in a while, but this is much closer to home base for me. 

they have just about everything you need to make a japanese meal and then some in asian cuisine. they have fresh produce and lots of different selections of frozen meat/fish/seafood too. like other reviewers mentioned, there are also tons of books and videos. if you're like me, you will love all the snacks and candies there. 

the store clerks that work there are way nice and make me feel like i'm in japan again."
"NC","What a gem to find! Hatoya has many Japanese food items like furikake, miso, and of course snacks! What surprised me is the selection of books and a DVD section! There is also a small section for household goods and a nice sized sake and beer section in the back. The staff is friendly, they may not speak a ton of English but that is what makes them so authentic! If you are in the area, definitely pop in to buy some treats! It's worth it, I promise!"
"NC","Great to have a real Japanese market with all the essentials for Japanese cooking."
"NC","Hatoya is awesome!  They have everything, even my favorite kind of  ready to cook pan fry yakisoba noodles - Marusan.  I think it's the best and it's hard to find in Charlotte.

It's a small shop but they have everything you could need to make your own sushi at home.  They have all kinds of tsukemono, tea, okake, miso, wakame, kombu, nori, candy like Pokki and gummies, pounded rice red bean pasties, Japanese bread, all kinds of pre-packaged treats and snacks...  I could list a hundred things I haven't seen since the last time I was actually in Japan.

The store is impeccably clean and run by the nicest Japanese people you ever met.  They were very patient with me when I was asking dumb questions like what kind of sauce to use when I try to make my own yaki-onigiri at home.  

It's down by pineville but the fact that they're a little cheaper than other places around Charlotte means it's worth the drive."
"NC","Very fast and nice service. The menu is a bit overwhelming, but they have lot of tasty options. Possibly the best true Mexican food I've ever had."
"NC","Celebrated a good friends birthday at the location and I really can't complain about the food or the service. The margaritas were great and it's authentic as it gets."
"NC","I've enjoyed eating at El Veracruz for lunch and drinks after work.  It took me almost a year to realize that it was an old Hardee's that they slapped a patio on and turned into a Mexican restaurant.

I defiantly enjoy the outdoor patio. They are constantly making improvements to it.  It's one of the rare places in the area where you can actually sit outside.

The food is good and the portions are plentiful.  The service is always great."
"NC","I've been coming here since moving to Charlotte last year. The workers here are professional and courteous, and I've been very pleased with their level of service. Do they try to upsell services? Sure, but find me a garage that doesn't. Having an established relationship with Jiffy Lube now, I know I can trust them. Cost is reasonable and wait time is fairly short, even on a Saturday."
"NC","First time customer 5/10/213.

 They are not very through. Went in for an inspection and failed due a broken passenger mirror and weak wipers. I repaired the mirror at another location and they noticed my belts were split and cracking very badly. If it was not for the mirrors, they would have passed me and my car would have been in bad shape later down the road. I'm glad I did not get my oil changed there who knows what would have happened"
"NC","I have two go-to oil change locations in the Charlotte area and this is one of them.  Why?  I demand 3 things from an oil change service:  1)  inexpensive, 2) fast (nothing worse than waiting in those cramped waiting ""rooms,"" with Oprah on the TV monitor and 3 day old coffee out of a styrofoam cup), and 3)  no pushy upcharging tactics.  

The last two times I've been here I've been their only customer (go early on Sundays), so I was in and out in no time.  Their basic oil change fee is $39.99 which is on par with most other places, but they often have coupons to drive down the cost.  They do pull your filters, but I didn't feel pressured to pull the trigger on an additional products or services.  They let me look at them and allow me to tell them what I want to do versus trying to convince me to do something.  They also recommend a service timeline.... meaning at X miles you should consider tire rotation or system flush or whatever.  Maybe all customers don't like that info, but I appreciate being informed since I can't keep my services records straight in my head.  Again, not pushy, just informative.

I'll admit the service model is a little weird.  You drop off your car like normal, but then someone escorts you into the waiting room, offers you coffee, etc.  You then walk up to the desk where they talk to you about what they've seen in your car and recommend certain products or services.  Feels a little forced and scripted, but if you can get past this, I feel this is a great place for the average Joe."
"NC","""Experienced better"" per the two stars? Not really. They're all the same. This was my second time here. Second time after my other engine oil changer shop annoyed me for the last time, but that's another review. First time here was OK-good. This time? Wasn't impressed. Irritated actually. Why do all these automobile engine oil changeries want to sell me on the power steering fluid flush? Or the fuel system cleaner? Or the fuel system additive (""improves fuel economy by 20%"" whoaaaa)? Or a new air filter. The only thing they didn't want to do was flush my brake fluid. Guess it was OK? They drained the engine oil then brought me in and proceeded to walk me through 200 services they could perform. Everything for $460. All of this after I said the engine oil change was all that was necessary. The guy really didn't care and continued to read off the ""sales"" screen. At one point I just about got into an argument with him when he started talking about change intervals. I ""learned"" that the recommended change interval was 3000 miles (""we don't go by months any more"" noted!) if you drive in X conditions (stop & go traffic, cold starts, drag racing, etc.). Otherwise it was 7500 miles. Perfect. He then asked if I wanted to go with 3000 miles, 7500 miles or my own decision. Huh? I'm going to get my vehicle's oil changed whenever the hell I want, aren't I? I didn't understand why he was asking that or the reason. He couldn't explain why he was asking the question either. We went round and round for a few seconds then I just said 5000 miles and he entered it in the computer. After that he walked through the remaining 100 services they offered and then showed me my air filter. Apparently, with the amount of dust that is in there, my air filter is reducing my gas mileage by 1-2%. Who knew? All I know is a dirty filter is more affective at trapping particles than a clean filter. I passed on the filter change and all the services, paid the $46 and was on my way. He was kind enough to introduce me to his manager and walk me to my car. That was a little awkward though. And, I saw them do it to everyone before me, so I wasn't special. After I got in my vehicle I noticed the next change interval was 3000 miles from now...why did I tell him 5000 miles again?

Where am I going with this? I know what I want and I need. If I claim I know and I don't, then it is on me. If I tell you I only want an engine oil change then that is all I want. Simple as that.

Not sure if I'll go back here. But then again, if I go to another place it'll be the same thing."
"NC","I used to be in the industry and I know what my car does and does not need.  They couldn't seem to get that, and kept trying to sell me crap.  Over-priced, slow, very dirty, and an overall sketchy vibe."
"NC","I always go here for oil changes they are quick and cheap not to mention its the closest jiffy lube to my house. they also send great coupons via mail/email! and its not usually crowded. i love it."
"NC","I agree with the 1 star here. It seems every time I'm in here I catch these guys when they have had a bad day. I'm in alot of businesses during the day and this has to be my least favorite one to go to. Not because of the product but the customer experience!"
"NC","Our country club recently hired the building company to install a rather large deck. After it was installed, several boards warped on the railing causing the dowels to fall out (dangerous) and the facia board all the way around warped. After MANY calls and emails they finally had someone show up only to say ""warping isn't covered"". It arped after one month! They said they would fix it for additional money - $1200. I can promise you these people will NOT stand behind their work and if you can find another retailer/contractor, I highly recommend doing so. Do not do business with these people."
"NC","I bought a number of items there. among them there was
- 1 item off the floor it wasn't delivered on schedule no biggie
- 1 entry door with transom ($500)
- 1 custom window $1,200.

The style of the door and the transom didn't match, I called and was told ""that's what you ordered"" . Really I asked for mismatched styles? I ordered for the lightest clearest low-e glass available, I got the dark type of glass that's recommended for Fla, Nm, Az etc. "" That's what you ordered"" was the response again. 

They don't even bother to ask what was shipped or what you ordered, they don't want to know because CYA is the order of the day.
Then when you go over your buyer's order you realize that regardless of the conversation you had with their salesperson the printed order is so vague that they could ship you anything at all and claim that's what you ordered. My contractor bought my siding there, it's an off-brand and the quality doesn't impress. 
Really shoddy practices

I ordered the rest of the windows ( Andersen) from The Plywood Mart although they won't match these and they were more expensive, that shows how I feel about sponsoring this store again"
"NC","This skate house is awesome. I visited over the weekend to see my boyfriend play a pickup hockey game and I really enjoyed it. We arrived there around 10:00 pm when it wasn't very crowded. The place seemed to be used a lot by local children in the earlier hours for entertainment purposes. There's also music that plays, pretty modern usually top 40. 

There is a bar, a place to eat skate rental and a skate pro shop which is awesome. The staff seemed to be really nice and helpful. The condition of the rink is also in good shape. There's a balcony overlooking the skate rink for a better view of the games but also bleachers around the rink. 

The restrooms seem to be in good shape. Toilet paper and hand soap are always restored so I haven't had trouble with that. Overall it's a great place to take your children but also great for those hockey/ice skating enthusiasts out there."
"NC","The Winter Olympics inspired us to hit the ice rink. I'm no Michelle Kwan but I've been on the ice a time or two. This rink just didn't blow my mind. 

We arrived right when the open skate time started (check their website for the schedule). The entry process is pretty simple. Walk to the building, pay your money ($10 for admission and skate rental) and grab your rental skates at the next window. 

The negatives... I was disappointed by the ice quality and the rental skates. The surface of the ice was pretty rough and needed a serious resurfacing. The rental skates were extremely dull. Yes, I know that they are rentals but it would have been nice if the blades had a decent edge. I also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink. This would have provided better separation for general skaters (the people that just want to skate circles) from the more experienced/technical skaters (the people that want to spin and jump). I've been to rinks that used the cones and it provided a better experience for all skaters. It would have been helpful if all skaters were aware of skating etiquette... There were also a few times that I found myself having to dodge people going the wrong direction!! 

The positives... They serve beer and wine!! If it wasn't so early in the day, I would have partaken. The employees that I interacted with seemed friendly enough. 

Pineville Ice House doesn't have a lot of competition, which means they really don't need to change much to stay in business. If you live in Charlotte and you want to go ice skating this will probably be where you head."
"NC","With a good low rate of $7.50 for entry and $2.50 for skate rental this is arguably the best option for a first-time ice skater in the Charlotte area. The Pineville Ice House, as it is better known, is great fun with the kids, a group, family, for a birthday party and most other stuff you think of doing at your standard roller-rink except the kicker is that it's on ice!

I've made it here a number of times including once with a big group for a [dangerous] game called broom ball. In broom ball, the players clad only in their everyday clothes and without ice skates, go out on the ice with a broom-like stick to swat at a ball until makes it into the other team's goal. All the while you spend most of your time trying not to throw yourself off balance with a misplaced swing and land yourself in the hospital with a concussion. But hey! This review isn't meant to trash ice skating. Only the futile and foolish game of broom ball.

Nonetheless, PIH is a good starting point for you up-and-coming figure skaters out there. The main advice I have is to just check their website as they have some oddly specific hours during which they are open to the public for skating. Watch out for the kids and remember to dress warm and always fall with closed hands or you'll take home less fingers than you brought."
"NC","Let me first start off by letting everyone know I'm originally from Minnesota. 

The Ice House is a fairly average rink that maintains their ice well. The ice makes all the difference in my opinion.

While the skate sharpening may be better than the ""other"" Charlotte rink (which is incredibly important if you're renting skates), but I'd have to recommend bringing your own skates in the first place. Yes, I know most people won't have their own...but rental skates in general are like wearing someone else's shoe...and skates...unlike shoes...are hard and not very pliable. So prepare for sore feet if you rent.

I found the employees to be very helpful and knowledgeable. I had fun chatting with them and found a couple from my neck-of-the-woods.

The only thing I would have liked to see different is the spaciousness of the place. I know there's not much that can be done about this, but on comparison (yes, from Minnesota...as everyone grows up playing hockey there), the Ice House is a bit cramped.

Overall, I liked the Ice House...so don't let the three stars fool you. The atmosphere is nice...the smell...oh how I love the smell...lol...as some of you may say ewwww...what's that smell. There's nothing like the smell of hockey!

I recommend the Ice House. It's a great date, a fun family place, a great place for kids to go, and something different for those of you that have never laced-up before."
"NC","Fun for all.  Friendly staff.  Decent price.  Maybe a little over-crowded on Saturday afternoon... would recommend."
"NC","The Pineville Icehouse is geared for hockey only.  The public skate times are too short and too expensive.  I tried renting skates, 3 pairs and no luck.  The first pair had laces that were cobbled together from 2 different skates.  The blades were dull and rounded over like an old butter knife.  The second pair was better, but the left blade was bent to the right at a 10 degree angle making it impossible to skate.  The last pair was a bit better, but wholly unusable.  This wasn't just my experience, this was the experience of all 7 of us in the group.  All the skates had been abused and hadn't seen a sharpener or any maintenance in quite some time.  

We decided to stick with Extreme Ice in Indian Trail.  It is a bit of a drive, but a professional operation start to finish.  New skates, longer skate times and a pro shop that caters to other skaters, not just hockey."
"NC","You may have heard recently that curling is all the rage since the Winter Olympics came through.  Some call it ""chess on ice"", but that may not be completely accurate, since chess is a little more precise in the placement of pieces.  Maybe ""shuffleboard on ice"" is a little more accurate.  Either way, the game (sport, whatever) is definitely entertaining.

The Charlotte Centre Curling Club is open for membership, and they just held their first Learn to Curl event at the Pineville Ice House.  About twenty intrepid souls, plus a few instructors and even local ""celebrity"" Larry Sprinkle, checked out the action and tried to figure out the game.

Played on ice, with droplets of water sprinkled on top to create a rougher surface which ""curls"" the 42-pound granite rocks, players try valiantly to maintain their balance while pushing the rocks back and forth, using sweeping techniques to get the rocks to go where they want (the sweeping action creates a path of sorts for the rocks).

Most of the session was spent figuring out how to keep your balance and push the rock towards the other end of the ice.  Yours truly spent a good bit of time on the ice.  The one time I managed to get the rock moving in the right direction, Larry Sprinkle was sweeping a bit too vigorously and he ended up on his backside.  Another, I didn't even make it that far and nearly took out the camera.  I hope I don't get a bill.  Or sued for nearly killing a local celebrity.

Apparently the feature will be shown on April 9th.  Have to keep an eye out for it.

At least for a limited time, the highlight video is online - complete with a shot of yours truly knocking Larry Sprinkle to the ice.

"NC","I don't have much experience with ice rinks, so I can't comment a bunch on the quality of the ice (it was cold, I guess that makes it okay) or much else.  I do agree that there isn't much in the way of creature comfort - you walk in and you're at the rink.  Having a warm(ish) area would be nice, because as soon as you go inside, you're inside, and even when you're not on the ice, it's downright chilly.

The facility seems fairly new, but on the inside, it's pretty run down in appearance.  I wouldn't expect it to be shiny and new, but it's not fancy by any stretch of the imagination.

One thing to remember is that it's not quite the same as being at a hockey game - it's at the ice level, so it's a good deal colder.  Make sure you bundle up when you take the family for public skate (which they do have).  You may want to use the bathroom before you go too, as it's rather nasty in there."
"NC","The Pineville Ice House is kinda crappy. There is no lobby. You walk in and you're in the ice rink, so there isn't a warm place to hang out or put on your skates. The ice is not great quality, and I've been pretty disappointed overall with my experiences there. If you're looking for a rink in Charlotte, check out the Extreme Ice Center."
"NC","My 97 year old mother who is blind moved from one room to another and the company said it would take a week to change the phone because it was a holiday.  After the week was up they said the work order was extended a month because they had so much new business.   I escalated the issue.   The said they would get back to me within 48 hours.  No response.  Some company!"
"NC","If there were a ""zero stars"" rating, Fairmont would have MORE THAN earned it.
This company leveraged itself to the eyebrows to purchase the right to use Verizon's obsolete landline infrastructure; the hedge funds that now own it have steadfastly refused to upgrade that infrastructure, with resulting extended outages for business and residential customer throughout the region.
We've had our business DSL line for three years. In that time we haven't had 30 consecutive days of uninterrupted service. Their ""routing issues"" have been daily, and their customer support structure is dysfunctional: the only thing they seem to have mastered is the ""I'm terribly sorry for you inconvenience"" portion of their telephone script. 
Since their latest foray into union-busting here it has only become worse. We in Vermont very much hope that our public service regulators will go after this mountain of corporate grift will all guns blazing: we've had enough of southern corporate carpetbaggers making promises they are systemically incapable of delivering on."
"NC","I have lived all over the US and even globally and I can honestly say that in my opinion FairPoint is the WORST telephone company I have ever dealt with. I moved in 11/2009 and they are still holding my credit balance refund hostage. When I called to request information, the company says I need to have a court order or be an attorney to have access to my own account information!? When I pointed out that the latter applies, I was transferred to another department. Even the managers are rude, unkind and argumentative. They don't dispute that they owe me money just that they should actually pay it to me in any kind of a reasonable timeframe. When I had their actual phone and internet service, it was highly unreliable, too and the technicians were almost as ""nice"" as the customer service people. If you live in an area where you have a choice, exercise that choice and go with a different company!"
"NC","On Yelp, a 500th review is a milestone.  It's a big deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews, it's a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  Fairpoint Communications is such a business.  Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver.  In a nutshell, it has been a disaster.

Fairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up.  They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth.  One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service.  When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly.  The billing was never correct.  The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day.  Calls about all of these issues rarely went well.  People were apologetic but problems remained.  Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers.  Two different people in my office were reduced to tears.  Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles..

My company switched carriers recently.  Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.

To Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.

To New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.

I don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.  I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with."
"NC","Update # 3...OK we went for our 'great experience'. It was ok. Massages themselves were good-to-great. Nothing else was improved. No follow-up from the manager considering the situation. I promise you that you can find something better to do with $175."
"NC","UPDATE #2 - spoke with the new spa manager and she promises a great experience for my friend and me. I will update."
"NC","UPDATE: I mailed a letter to the spa director with our list of complaints. I was surprised when I received a phone call from the director. He wanted to discuss our experience and promised that they were in a transition, updating the spa, etc. He refunded our money and offered us a massage at no cost so that we could be impressed and change our minds about this place. We were looking forward to a great experience, as promised and I fully planned on updating my rating here on Yelp.

So, I called last week to book our appointments only to find that the director is no longer with the spa. I left a message with the spa manager and after several days she has yet to return my call. I guess the good service left with the director."
"NC","I was so surprised as to the level of disappointment I experienced at this spa. My best friend and I (she flew in from NJ for a visit and we planned a girls' day) went to this spa for 1 hour massages, both of us choosing hot stone. We both have experienced this type and other kinds of massages in many different places, NJ, NY, California to name a few.
Here are my main issues:
1- we are greeted by a very nice woman who does not understand or speak English. We ask questions and we are answered 'yes' every time. When we asked about the spa pools (are they hot or cold water?) we get a 'yes'. I ask again, are they hot? We get a yes. SHe leaves and we touch the water and both pools are ice cold. We find the hot tub, figure it out ourselves and the jets, which do not move, are facing straight up, therefore making a huge mess and we can't sit in front of the jets to loosen up any muscles. It was a joke.
2- the hallway from the pools to the locker room is so sterile, I thought I was in a hospital.
3- my massage, was all about the stones. My very nice therapist added hot stones then removed them over and over again for 50 minutes. SHe didn't massage anything. I kept on waiting for the manipulation to start, thinking she was maybe warming me up and relaxing my muscles and she was going to start the actual massage any second. Then we were done. What the heck?  My friend's massage included an actual massage.
4- the tranquility room is an open space right off the showers. there is no tranquil anything about this 'room'. No soft lighting, no blankets (I was quite chilly), no anything to make me feel I was in a special place to enjoy my quiet time.
5- the pleasure of this experience, and i use that term kindly, cost me a whopping $175.  I haven't felt THIS ripped off in a very long time.
If you are used to a special experience and you feel you deserve to be pampered and be made to feel good, Do Not Go Here unless you don't care where your money goes."
"NC","The Spa at Ballantyne Hotel is a full-service day spa that offers massages, facials, body wraps, mani & pedis.  They also have a hair salon, fitness center, as well as indoor & outdoor pools.  It definitely reminds me of some great destination spas that I have visited while on business trips in Scottsdale AZ.  

Sadly, I have only had a mini back massage so far, but the Massage Therapist (Natalie) was AWESOME!   She did an excellent job in a really short amount of time!  

Overall, the Spa at Ballantyne is pricer than some of the other upscale spas in the area, but if you want to splurge and experience total luxury, this is the way to go!"
"NC","I was new in town and needed an eyebrow wax. I found the Spa at Ballantyne and decided to give it a try. Although I received a skewer of yummy pinneaple while I was waiting for my technician that was the highlight of my expereince. We got in the room and after what seemed like just two strips pulled off she said I was done. She didn't have a mirror in the room so she said I could use a metal bowl to try and see my reflection or we could go into the bathroom and she could tweeze and strays in there. Are you kidding?
This wouldnt have been so bad if it was super cheap, but the waxing was $20 and then they add automatic tip on there so it came to $24. There are many places less expensive or where you get more for your money."
"NC","Great spa!! Had a blueberry facial - felt instantly hydrated which I really needed. They have a ton of options and really helpful, knowledgeable staff. It's worth the investment!!"
"NC","I made a reservations for my bf and i at the spa on 6/14/14 to have a relaxing Day but they gave me a stressful week. It was a really nice place. i was planning to go again but not anymore.
I was very disappointed when i found out that i got charged twice and got 2 overdraft fees because of the spa and the amount was  different compared to the first time being charged also my bf got charged and it was a different amount too. I think this was fraud because they charged our cards different amounts without our authorization. I received a refund a week later from the spa after several disputes."
"NC","Love hanging at pool after spa treatments. My wife and I live a few miles away and use this place as a getaway.  We get massages, workout, swim, eat, hot tub, steam room and relax here."
"NC","Over crowded, loud, and not a relaxing experience. Stayed at the hotel and booked two massages. Was looking forward to a tranquil  environment, sadly that did not happen. The service was below par and did not measure up to the quality of the hotel. I was not told about the facilities available, it was loud, crowded, I was told I could relax after massage with my husband, that did not happen, and checking in was not smooth. Sadly not worth the money or time."
"NC","I treated my mom and myself to Sea Pearl Facials, Bottoms Up Pedicures, and Luxury Manicures on April 1st, 2014, at the Spa. I have lived in the Ballantyne area for years; however, this was my first visit to the Spa at Ballantyne. Overall, we were very satisfied with every service we received. We were welcomed and had a full tour of the facilities upon arrival. 

I personally had Leigh for my facial, and she was amazing. She talked with me at length about my skin type, the products that would work well, and the experience was incredibly relaxing. I have had facials before, but this is the best one I've ever had. My mom was equally satisfied with her service, and said she could have stayed on the table forever. 

I had Choyoung for my bottoms up pedicure and luxury manicure. She was an expert, and sought to ensure comfort at every step! My mom and I had these together, and it was a great experience - relaxing, refreshing, and lots of good chatter. We had a beautiful view of the golf course, and were sipping complimentary Pomegranate Martinis during these services. I have not been doing a mani/pedi on a regular basis, but am considering adding this on a monthly basis. Choyoung was very welcoming, friendly, and efficient. 

The only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout. After gathering our things from the locker room, we came back up to check out. My mother went into the shop to browse while I waited to pay. There was one customer at the desk actively engaged in a conversation with the man behind the desk. There was a woman behind the desk also, not participating in the discussion, but seemed like she was politely listening. 

She clearly saw us walk up, and my mother go into the shop. I stood there for a bit, expecting that since the other customer was actively engaged in conversation with the other staff member, she would respond but did not. I almost said 'excuse me', but given I do customer service for a living as well, I wanted to see how long she would ignore me. I continued to stand there, and finally she (Lindsey) greeted me. I must say she was the most cold and rude person I encountered at the Spa. She presented me with the itemized bill before charging my card with $700 in services and a forced 20% gratuity (I normally tip 20% and would have anyway, but it's nice for the customer to have that choice), and then focused back on the previous conversation while she was printing receipts. It was almost as if I was a bother to her. After I received my receipt, I started to walk into the shop, and I heard her greet the person behind me with a totally different attitude. 

After the fantastic service received from all of their services staff throughout the day, it was not something I expected at the end. It goes to show you that a borderline rude customer experience at the end can ruin the entire impression of a business. Additionally, I sent this feedback in e-mail to the Spa, and heard absolutely nothing from them...not even a 'sorry'."
"NC","What a nice treat the Spa at Ballantyne was. I booked a hot stone massage & learned I was able to use all amenities offered, steam room, sauna, outdoor pool, fitness center, etc. I arrived early to enjoy the pool, b/c it was a great day out. I ordered lunch and the service was great. Waiters serving water throughout the day and checking in with me often. I proceeded to the spa about 40 minutes prior to my service & enjoyed the steam room and relaxed in the lounge where I was offered a complimentary drink, so I chose a glass of champagne. A nice treat! My massage was 50 minutes and I loved it! I will definite be back!"
"NC","It takes a lot for me to give a nasty review, and this place earns it.

I was in town for a mini reunion - 4 of my friends from all over the US met here to catch up (after 20 years!).  I have lived all over the world, and appreciate spa's of all sorts and facilities....and always the main thing comes back to service.

First, the greeting here was nice.  We had reservations for our treatments and confirmed at the desk then went on the tour. The facilities are wonderful.  Very posh.  Beautiful pools, indoor and out, and the spa was relaxing and comfortable.

Now with posh places, they can often miss the point of actual ""treatment"".  But keep in mind I go to a Korean spa in Los Angeles and get an old lady to scrub me down like a little dirty kid so that my skin glows.  Still, I expect the actual treatment.

So I had a massage.  Can't go wrong with that - right?  Well....maybe you can.  I choose the only man on staff, as I like a strong massage.  I can honestly say that he spent more time adjusting my blanket a million times then he did actually rubbing me.  It was almost annoying.  I was ready to rip the blanket off.  I'm here for a rub down, not fluffy adjustment of the blanket and how it covers me LOL.  So whatever....

When I got back I asked my friends if their treatments were nice.  All said ""ok"" and I had wondered if they just didn't know better or didn't want to complain.  One did complain.  She said that she didn't get the hot oil head treatment.  Oh that's sucky - because it is an add on service and costs a little bit.  But she really wanted it.  Well it's not missing it that pissed me off....it's what the lady told her.  She basically told my friend ""well I totally forgot and I don't have time....but what a shame cuz I do a really good treatment"".  Well if that isn't the biggest f-you ever?  She should have taken the time to DO it!

Then we go to pay.  Well....now here is the part that totally had me trumped.  Like I said, I've been to spas on every single corner of this earth, and never before have I seen this done.  They basically add a 20% gratuity.  They PRE add it.  Then they say to you ""well, if you feel you want to give them less, we can change it"".  WOW WOW WOW!  So are you really suppose to feel like an jerk and say they deserve less?  

So first my friend - she told them to take off the charge for the service she didn't get, then said she did want to tip less since the girl made her feel bad.  They said to her ""well you know the tip get's shared by all of us"".  Oh my Lord.  

My turn.  I say to her, well I've never heard of this being done before and it's kinda odd to shove the gratuity down our throats.  We all would have paid it anyhow, but it's the fact that we are demanded to without knowing that leaves a bad taste in our mouths.  I paid and didn't fight.

But then...there was a local man standing in line waiting to pay too.  He said to the girl...""what can I bitch about to try to get a discount?"".  WOW.  Is this really how these locals act?  He didn't know our situation.  He didn't know how we were treated.  So my friend who lives there turned around and said something to him - basically to mind his own business.  The girl behind the counter LAUGHED.

Oh no.  In the car, my friend called several times to speak to a manager.  They kept sending her to voicemail. She left two voicemails.  NO call back.

You can have the prettiest little southern spot and posh trimmings, but the meat is your treatments and your service.  In my booked you failed on both."
"NC","I'm only commenting on the salon because that is all I went to during my stay at the hotel.  I was lucky to get a last minute reservation to get a manicure since it was Mother's Day weekend and they were apparently booked the entire time.

I got an essential manicure with Marilyn and she was awesome.  She was friendly without being overly so, and we had a nice conversation while she dealt with my train wreck nails.  

The salon offers complimentary mimosa's which in hindsight I wish I had indulged in one, but I passed. 

Things to note:

This is not a cheap place.  You are paying more for the ambiance than probably the quality.  It wasn't bad, but you can get  a cheaper everything if you go somewhere else.  That being said, I was staying at the hotel and enjoyed the convenience and was willing to pay more for it.

They automatically add in a 20% tip.  They do make you aware of this, but not until after your service.  I am sure it is posted somewhere, but I didn't know until it was point out when I went to pay.  

I am looking forward to trying some of the spa services next time I stay at the hotel.  I was jealous of everyone walking around in bath robes looking so relaxed."
"NC","If you want a great spa in Charlotte with amenities.. this is your place.
Steam room
Gym
Outdoor pool
Indoor jacuzzi and pools

I had a body treatment that left my skin feeling super soft after the summer. Pricy, but worth it as I spent 4-5 hours there... perfect relaxing day."
"NC","Every year on Black Friday, my mom, sister, 2 aunts and I come over for facials.  It's our way of avoiding the malls and such and to have a girls day of sorts.  It's attached to a hotel and is pretty fancy and on the pricey side, but I'm guessing they have a certain type of guest they go after.  Full service spa with facials, spa treatments, massages, wraps, etc.  The staff is always friendly and very pleasant to deal with.  We're led downstairs to pick up lockers and sandals and head into the locker rooms to get changed.  

We're always called back on time (sometimes early if we're there early) and the girls who do our facials are absolutely wonderful.  They work well and always cater to the skin type of who they're working on.  My only complaint is at the end of the facial, they always do this tapping thing with their fingers all over your face and that annoys me for some reason.  I'm really not a fan of it for some reason!!  Anyways, they always fill out a card with the products that they used if you're interested in purchasing them for yourself and offer you water when you leave.  Keep in mind, it's pricey over here so it's a splurge when you go, but worth it!"
"NC","Yes, this spa is probably pricey compared to other places, but it's in a nice hotel with a certain type of clientele I'm sure.  But I guess maybe because I'm from LA and going to Glen Ivy and Burke Williams has spoiled me for the cheaper places?  I expect not only the service but amenities as well.   I want it to be a day of pampering.

I took my bestie out for a spa day since she really needed one.  I booked my massages and pedicures over the phone from LA.  The lady that helped me on the phone gave me a few helpful tips.  They have a ""couples massage package"" that has a scrub and a massage, but she told me how that one worked, and being that yes you get to be in the same room with your friend, mom, daughter, partner but one does the massage while the other has the scrub and then you switch.  Yes it's a cheaper package, but if we get our own massages, they can set it up to be at the same time and adjoining rooms.  Okay - thanks for the heads up!

I also had to move the day last minute due to some scheduling problems with my bestie, but we were able to easily reschedule luckily.

We arrived for our massages probably about 10-15 mins early.  We were hoping for a little more time, but after going to lunch it just got a bit closer than planned.

We were greeted at the front desk and we were told to head downstairs and an attendant will help us once we got there.  Once we were downstairs, the guy down there called up a female attendant so that she could show us around the women's spa area and gave us our slippers.

I have to say, for someone who's been to quite a few nice spas, this was more or less par for the course.  Extremely clean.  Plenty of towels available.  I did wish there was a hot tub in the area like in most spas, but there was multiple dressing areas with lockers (that had robes waiting for us), showers, a sauna and a steam room, plus the waiting area that had an assortment of teas, coffee, water with cucumber or fruit or plain water plus a nuts/dried fruit mix and a mix of chips for us to eat.  I think there were also apples.

We waited for our massages (which were 80 mins aromatherapy massages that were at a discount because they were the special promotional ones for the Thanksgiving holiday) and our massage therapists came to get us.  Come to find out now only were the rooms next to each other, it kinda was like having a ""couples"" massage anyways because the adjoining rooms actually had a door with sliding doors so it because one big room anyways.  

We thoroughly enjoyed our massages and when we were leaving, our massage therapists were there for us with water and three roses a piece.  It was very special.

Back to the waiting area for our pedicures.  We stopped by the sauna on the way to relax a bit since we had about 30 mins before we needed to be ""picked"" up by our pedicure ladies.

Our pedicures were nice.  Since it was also put as a ""couples"" pedi, we were sitting next to each other with a nice view of the pool area and the golf course.  The ladies doing our pedicures were super nice and friendly. 

We had a great time over all.  Yeah, we could have paid less to a day spa elsewhere and a pedicure elsewhere, but we were there to have a spa experience, and we were able to have our nice girls day out."
"NC","I fiancé gave me a gift card here for my birthday. I was so excited because I work for a salon and spa so I was wanting to get pampered. I received a body wrap, a massage, a shampoo blow dry and a manicure. The only thing I enjoyed was Brenda who did my body wrap she was awesome! My massage was with tym. He didn't listen to anything I said. I told him I am on my feet all day and I have back problems so I would like him to focus on my back and to please not rub my feet. He did the total opposite. He maybe rubbed my back for 5 minutes ad did my legs and feet for the rest and the time. Then told me one of my legs were shorter than the other and I should get it checked out. I'm sorry but that was so rude he could have tried to say it nicely. The lady who did my blowout was very sweet but my hair was still wet at the roots when I left and the ends of my hair was fizzy. For $40 I expected so expected something a lot better. Lastly I got a manicure I didn't need more than a buff and polish because I get a manicure once a week anyways. But I saw if I got an upgrade from that I could get a massage in that so I did. If I would have known that ""massage"" would have just been putting lotion on my hands I would have not paid the extra. The ladies at the mall do a better job. Needless to say I am extremely displeased with my services here. (Besides Brenda) Maybe because I am a service provider myself so my exceptions are high. But next time I pay $420 somewhere I'll make sure it's not here."
"NC","This is a fantastic, well appointed hotel, but with a very easy going staff.
We'd definitely stay here again."
"NC","As you pull down the promenade and approaching the hotel, you pass by some amazing shops, restaurants and a theater within walking distance.  The first thing that I noticed when I walked in past the giant fountain was the free wifi in the lobby.  Although wifi in the room is limited, short and slow.  The entrance is bright, open in a colonial style with piano and complimentary coffee, tea and cookies.  TV in the bathroom.  WOW!!  Not only that, but curved shower curtain and tiled shower.  The Neutrogena toiletries are a good touch.  The bedding was very comfortable.  Always love a free breakfast, but is also a great grocery and cafe next door.  Overall it is better than your typical Hampton with some great little touches."
"NC","All the other reviews are true. This is one of the nicest Hampton Inns you will find. Very well decorated. Large beautiful rooms. Feels like a luxury hotel. The whirlpool and bathroom mirror tv are terrific touches. The staff was helpful and polite. It's in a terrific area with lots of great shopping and dining options. I literally have nothing negative to say about the hotel.

However, the reason this isn't a 5 star review is because the night my wife and I stayed there, there was some kind of party going on at the restaurant right next door. They had a band that was playing ridiculously loudly until well past midnight. Needless to say, the incessant music did little to enhance what was meant to be a nice night out together.

I hate holding this against the hotel as they had no control over it and the staff was very sympathetic, but it nonetheless significantly impacted our stay. I would recommend calling ahead before you book to find out if any parties have been scheduled, if that kind of thing bothers you. We really want to stay there again, and I assure you I will be calling.

Excellent hotel, less than excellent experience. Too bad."
"NC","Both my colleague and I arrived at Hampton Inn & Suites to stay two nights.  He stayed on the 3rd floor and I was on the 4th floor, we both had magnificent suites.  I must say this is one of the best Hampton Inn's I have ever stayed in.  In fact, it was one of the best hotels I've stayed in.  The hotel location is conveniently located within walking distance of several restaurants and shops/boutiques.  There are also several businesses and a large mall nearby.  The hotel is 'grand' and the entrance is beautiful.  When I arrived to my room, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The updated open kitchen and living room combination were beautifully decorated and super clean.  The separate bedroom/bathroom were spacious.  The vanity near the bathroom even offered a built in vanity TV within the mirror!  We walked to PF Chang's Chinese Bistro for dinner, then walked over to Dean & DeLuca for a quick dessert.  

Beautiful hotel with wonderfully convenient amenities.  The cost of the suites were high (we received a corporate rate), but very well worth the price.

Cons - limited nearby parking and one of the front desk clerks was rude to my colleague during check-in.  This rating would have been 5 stars had it not been for that check-in experience.  Bottom line, this hotel is definitely worth staying at again!

Cheers!"
"NC","i have never been in a hampton inn this nice!  it felt like a much higher end hotel - also cost more than the typical hampton inn.  i had a 1st floor room, private patio with table and chairs, beautiful room.  the neighborhood is nice, can walk and shop and explore - upscale shops and lots of nice places to dine.
only criticism is the fitness facility which was lame - 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical, 1 bench, dumbbells to 50 lbs.  no place to do situps, no yoga type mats, small and crowded room without a clock on the wall!"
"NC","I just came back from this hotel where I stayed 3 nights. I have to say, this is the best Hampton Inn I've ever stayed at. This specific hotel was so nice and looked very high end compared to the other Hampton Inn's I've been to. The staff was very nice as well. Awesome features like a TV in the bathroom mirror! The bed's were very comfy. The neighborhood was very nice and high-end with a lot of stores and restaurants nearby (a decent movie theatre at the opposite end of the plaza). You really do need a car to get around although I hear the hotel offers a shuttle within a 5-mile radius. Would definitely stay here again!"
"NC","Very nice hotel. Had a King bed with a whirlpool tub. The best part was the tv in the mirror in bathroom. Hotel had complimentary tea, coffee and cookies. The reason I took a star off was because we prepaid with one credit card at a certain rate, and upon checkout were billed again for the night for a totally different rate. The front desk did finally take care of this. Also at breakfast there was no food ready and we had to wait about 15 mins. Other than that the hotel was very nice"
"NC","Pretty classy Hampton Inn. The overall decor and amenities are nice. The rooms are big and clean and comfy. The desks, as I travel a lot for work, are spacious and allow you to spread out your stuff. There are televisions in the mirrors! People here are helpful. There is an outdoor pool, perfect for summer months. The hotel is very close to lots of walkable restaurants and shopping. There is free coffee and sweet sweet cookies all day long. The wakeup calls are made by real PEOPLE, not automated devices.

The downsides:
-there are only two pieces of exercise equipment in the fitness room.
-the business center has technology that seems to be from the 20th century (printers print WAY too slow!)
-there is no hotel bar/restaurant. Just a free continental breakfast, which is GREAT, but it's one of those free continental breakfasts...

Those brief downsides keep it from being a 5-star place, but it's probably not this one particular site's issue (except for probably the business center), these are probably  franchise issues. But I would return."
"NC","Attended a seminar at this hotel recently and found it to be a great place for a corporate event. The hotel lobby is nice and ballrooms are well equipped for all sorts of meetings. The only possible problem is parking - it seems that could be a bit of an issue if there is a lot going on at the time of your event."
"NC","Once again a Hampton Inn does not disappoint! This Hampton Inn & Suites at Phillips Place was beautiful and pristine! When we came in, there was someone playing the piano in the lobby! How welcoming! The staff member that checked us in was very friendly and informative about attractions in the area. Our room was spacious and elegantly decorated. The TV in the bathroom mirror was a nice addition. The TV in the room was set up to attach a PC/game system/DVD player. All you need is your device and the cable. Also, the WiFi is free! We were at this hotel for an extended stay (12 days) and I have to say that our room service was exceptional!! We weren't always up early and no matter what time we finally came out they managed to service our room and make everything fresh!! We have stayed other places that would skip our room if we came out late, but not here! The breakfast was great and there was something different most every day! The food service staff was very accommodating and friendly! ( We love the afternoon Otis Spunkmeyer cookies!) We didn't use the pool, but it looked clean and inviting! The patio area was charming and a great place for early morning coffee or late afternoon chats. I read some complaints about the parking, but we didn't find that to be much of a problem for us. We almost always found a spot around the back and used our room key to come in through the dining room area versus the lobby. No problem. AND the parking is free! There are several great restaurant choices within walking distance. During our 12 day stay went to Wolfgang Puck's Pizza Bar, The Palm, PF Changs, and Pinkberry for some frozen yogurt. Also, the movie theater was within walking distance. Also, there is a Whole Foods opening up right next door later in the summer!
The hotel was beautiful, well equipped, quiet, and a great value! We loved the staff, the convenient location, and would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family! Thanks for such a wonderful place to stay!"
"NC","WOW. What a nice hotel for the price.  The breakfast area was great with oatmeal, eggs, fruit, yogurt.  You can even make your own waffle.  Rooms are VERY nice with great beds and furniture.

They even have sacks you can grab if in a rush with bananas and a breafast bar.

TV in the mirror. TV in the mirror. TV in the mirror. TV in the mirror.

Really cool."
"NC","Lovely hotel. Big work desk to get stuff done on your laptop. High speed Internet. Pillow top bed so comfy. 3 TVs in double queen suites. You guess where the third tv is. Security safe in each room. Refrigerator, microwave, plenty of storage space, pull out couch (bed), and continental breakfast with SAUSAGE and waffles.  Waking distance to upscale shops, theater, restaurants (P.F. Chang crowded&wait)."
"NC","This is the best Hampton Inn that I have ever stayed in. We love the magic behind the mirrors in the bathroom. The management and the staff are fantastic also. If any of our family comes to town, this is where they will stay."
"NC","Holy Crap! This is the nicest Hampton Inn I've ever stayed in.

There was a TV in the bathroom mirror with a remote! What high-end hotels have this, let alone a Hampton Inn?!

Other than that awesomeness, our room was spacious and clean, also with a nice flat-screen in the room, and a lot of TV channels. Free breakfast was great: there were a few hot items and make-your-own waffles along with the cereal/bagel standards.

With the hotel's location, right in Phillips Place, you can walk to a few restaurants like the Dean & DeLuca wine bar, and a Pinkberry! Yay! There are also an array of high-end boutiques in the shopping center.

If I was going to stay in the neighborhood of Charlotte again, I'd stay here for sure!"
"NC","We stayed at a hampton inn in concord one night, then this hampton the next night. This one was so much better, except for the room we were in. 602 made us both sick, it had a mold or something. The front desk was very courteous in moving us when this was mentioned and the 2nd room was very nice. Breakfast was delish. And the hotel is located in a very nice area, right next to southpark mall and right down the road from carowinds :)"
"NC","Very likely my most favorite Hampton Inn ever. The perfect place for business travelers. In the lovely Southpark area of Charlotte, this Hampton Inn crowns the Phillips Place shopping center. And, oh is that a treasure trove of fun!!

This is one of those Hampton Inns that is perfect for those on the sales route train (or, I'm guessing, any kind of business travel). Located in a convenient and bustling Charlotte neighborhood. Near the mall if you're into dinners or lunches at places like Maggiano's. The Phillips Place shopping center also boasts a Palm, a Dean & De Luca (why don't we have one of these yet in Atlanta??? Seriously.), a PF Chang's, and . . . some of the cutest little boutiques this little girl has ever found. Historically, I made myself decide pre-check-in if I was ""allowed to shop."" It's that good - from Luna to everything else, so many tempting pretties, and right outside my hotel room door!

The type of service you'd expect from a busy and well run Hampton Inn, always good and reliable Internet service and a well-equipped business center if you need it - plus the whole place has an ""exterior"" that makes it look kinda like a mini White House. That's just what it has always made me think of, but whatever your impression I'm betting you'll find it a welcoming respite during any busy business or recreational trip."
"NC","Not the best Courtyard I've stayed at, but you can not beat it for location and convenience. It is just outside the airport perimeter and while they do have a shuttle, I didn't use it for this stay.

I was checked in close to midnight by a friendly clerk who efficiently recognized my Platinum status, swiped my credit card, prepared two room keys and gave me directions to my room. All good.

There were only two problems with cleanliness of the room. After lying down in bed, I noticed something crunchy under the sheet. Some previous guest's luggage tag had attached itself and been laundered with the sheet. Yes, the sheet was clean and so was the luggage tag. I decided that this was no big deal and moved on. In the morning, a previous guest (likely not the same one) had left a bar of soap in the shower and this had not been removed by the people who cleaned the room. A little icky - what else did they forget? - but I moved on for this too. Accidents happen, they can't be perfect every time, right?

The room was comfortable and other than one loud group of guests who arrived shortly after I did, it was very quiet. In the morning, I was out and gone well before the vacuum cleaners started.

Note that the Courtyard brand of properties does not offer a free breakfast. Head over to Fairfield or SpringHill if that's what you need. I like Courtyard because it generally indicates more business travelers and fewer families (i.e., no screaming kids running down the hallways).

Would I stay here again? You can't beat the location near the airport (and right off I-85). Yeah, I think so."
"NC","Real close to the airport. Modern rooms, comfortable beds, nice bistro downstairs in the lobby with a mini bar. All the staff we encountered was friendly. 

It was nice to have a porch outside on the upper floors. There are chairs and tables out there. 

Bathrooms are average."
"NC","I would give this place a 0 star if I could! 
KYRA, the front desk customer service agent was very rude and not friendly at all!!
I told her that I was a Platinum Marriott (1,100,000 points!) rewards member and she seemed to get very Argumentative  and defensive saying no I wasn't, I was only a silver member. I showed her my credit card, license and platinum rewards card and she never entered the number Or my credit card information apparently. (Which I found out after as you'll read below) I went to the room only to find a filthy carpet, lint balls in the bed,  a completely clogged bathroom sink and no extra towels soaps or shampoos in the tub area . They give you one small soap at this hotel! 
I called downstairs to let them know and the woman that answered the phone said that my name wasn't even listed for this room!!  
Apparently KYRA DIDN'T DO HER JOB and not only did not put my platinum rewards card into the computer, she also didn't even put my name or credit card on the room. What she did put in however it was my other  flight crew members credit card paying for both rooms. This cannot happen!!  I will NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN nor will my other crew members!  Unfortunately I was on only a nine hour layover and could not, or did not have the energy to argue with these people. I will make sure to get the word out to have no airline or corporate crews stay at this DUMP OF A HOTEL. I've stayed at some pretty shabby Motels better than this. But you know, with all the hundreds of Marriotts that I've stayed at, there always has to be one bad apple I suppose and Charlotte Courtyard Marriott,, you should be proud of earning the title of being that one bad apple. Between the rudeness. the inaccurate information entered into the computer, the filthiness of the room and the lack of routine maintenance I give this place a zero!! 00000"
"NC","Scary awful. I needed a room by the airport for an early morning flight. I've always had good experiences in the past so I booked a room.

The first thing I see when I walk in the door is an angry woman named ""Chrystal"" (refuses to give a last name) with a look on her face you only see on a bad day at the DMV or on a prison inmate. I think maybe she's having a bad day (or a bad life) so I smile anyway rather than doing what I should have done and headed straight out the door. The angry ""Chrystal"" just continues to look like she found a turd in her lunchbox. 

I let angry Crystal know we are Rewards Members thinking this might soften her belligerent glare. No luck. After an agonizing minute of talking with her, I inform her I'm not happy with my interaction with her and ask for her manager. She denies a manager is available and then gives me the card of someone else who works there but is also not available. I later learn the person who's name she gave me is not the real manager at all. So angry Crystal is a liar on top of dedicating herself to creating misery in others through her toxic attitude. 

Employees like Crystal are no doubt the reason this Marriott has the lowest yelp rating of any Marriott in the State. Whoever does the hiring at this hotel desperately needs basic training. They are asleep at the switch. 

In short, there's a good reason this Marriott location has an extremely low rating."
"NC","Friendly staff and all but the bathroom was rundown and the wife lifted the slip around the mattress and the mattress was streaked, skanky and old.

I had two girls with me and so we needed extra towels but the housekeeper in the hall told me ""I need a towel from you to give you a towel but anyway we don't have any extra so I can't help you."" So I walked down to the fitness center and grabbed two towels and the housekeeper looked at me and I looked back at her and i just squeezed by lol.

Funny another reviewer mentioned a flying beetle in the room, we had one of those, too! I got rid of it myself, though lol.

Also, they have the bistro setup, I just don't like those at all. To get coffee, you have to buy it from the 'bistro' instead of the free coffee setup Courtyard used to have. 

For those of us that are Marriott-loyal, I think the Fairfield Inns are better value. They are just as comfortable, the beds and pillows are just as good- which is really all we care about- breakfast is free, and they tend to be newer."
"NC","Nice room and staff but the point of staying here is its proximity to the airport and that was the flaw in my stay. I had a 7:30 am flight so I wanted to get to the airport around 6:30. They had a 6:00 and 6:30 shuttle and they said it was a five minute drive. So I chose 6:30. I chose poorly. It would have been ok if they did not wait 5 minutes for a guy who was late, drop him at Hertz and then drop another guy at Budget. Plus the airport traffic was horrible and the precheck line was long and slow. Extra stress that no one needs."
"NC","Worst service in a Marriot.  My key did not work, went to the office and she did not even check my name!!!!.... Waited for the shuttle around 40 min at the airport.  Not even friendly people working there..."
"NC","Nice hotel, will stay here again.  Clean, quiet, comfortable.  Breakfast is not included."
"NC","We love Marriott's and this Courtyard was good.  Yes, it has ZERO curb appeal, so if you're staying for long and hanging at the hotel, this may not be the place for you. It is convenient to the highway, with one way being a u-turn situation.  But you can't walk anywhere from this location.

The staff was exceptionally helpful and accomodating.  Everything was clean and fresh.  Disappointing that they now are using ""The Bistro"" format and don't offer any type of breakfast included.  There aren't any quick coffee/doughnut shops anywhere like there seem to be in the northeast.

Definitely a short-term, airport convenient type of place.  They have a pool and hot tub, but the outside fire put was never on while we were there.  Also, I wouldn't recommend for families.  The kids would be bored."
"NC","They took my room number and made a 9 am shuttle appt when I checked in. I come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left. Front desk called shuttle and they ""were already at the airport"". Why make an appt in the first place if you weren't going to keep it? Why take down my room number if you weren't going to call me? So much for. Being a platinum member. Skip these clowns"
"NC","My flight got in late at night and I didn't want to drive down to Greensboro and wake my brother up late at night upon my arrival. So I got a hotel here in Charlotte for the night. Good hotel, very close to the airport and check in was a breeze. Nothing overly fancy, just an overall decent hotel. They have a bistro with Starbucks which is GREAT for a coffee addict from New England. And free wifi!"
"NC","Things I liked: the patio outside my room. This would bump it up to four or five stars. 

Things I didn't like: this place is located right next to the highway AND underneath flight paths. It can get loud at night until the planes stop landing and taking off at CLT. 

The place is also always hopping because of all the traveling business people like me who may land late and don't want to travel all over heck and creation to a hotel. So it's got that going for them. Unfortunately, this means the bistro is packed at all times and so you may have to budget a few extra minutes in the morning to get your breakfast before going off to work."
"NC","I've stayed at 3 Marriott properties this week and this is both the worst of the 3, and of any I've stayed at in at least a year.  

The location is bad (you hear the flights coming and going), there isn't good food  (non-hotel, non-fast food), within a reasonable walking area, the shuttle service is poor (35 minute wait for a 6 - 7 minute ride), the front desk was rude, the bar staff was very inexperienced, and as an elite member I still got stuck with a room with a funky odor next to the elevator.

Next time I'll stay at a higher quality hotel further away from the airport."
"NC","I got stuck overnight in Charlotte and was placed here on a voucher from the airline. As a 20-something girl traveling solo at the time I was really afraid that this place would be sketchy, because I've had horrible luck in the same situation in Atlanta in the past. This hotel is extremely nice, clean, and up to date. The treadmills in their fitness center are awesome! The hotel staff was extremely nice and accommodating. The hotel restaurant was pretty good too. All in all a fantastic experience!"
"NC","We had an overnight layover in Charlotte and wanted something to hold us over. This place went above and beyond. 
First, the customer service is some of the best (if not THE best) I've ever experienced at a hotel. Everyone was kind and really put forth an effort. The gentleman at the front desk as well as the shuttle driver were super nice and helpful. 
I would certainly stay here again! :)

Plus** They have a great drink selection in the lobby. From a wide variety of beers to Starbuck coffee, I'm happy :)"
"NC","Not bad if you're stuck on the out skirts of town, the breakfast in the am IS NOT free, it's around $10 if you'd like eggs and sausage buffet,  $6 if you just want continental. They are doing some construction outside, seem to be expanding, so that's always a good sign :). Not many dining options in the area, McDonalds, Bojangles, Waffle House, etc., but getting back to City center is pretty easy. They have a shuttle that will pick you up from the airport, if you call when you land. The exercise room was pretty standard, 1 out of 3 treadmills worked, but a decent dumbbell selection

The only bad about the experience, was the house keeper, who behaved as if we were holding her up from something. As I walk out of my room she  yells down the hallway ""What time do you want service!?"" I told her that I don't know, maybe around one, and she freaks out, and storms off."
"NC","Basic dive with boiled dogs, some toppings, and french fries.  No frills served on Styrofoam plates.  Interesting throw back to days gone by and that's their hook."
"NC","Came here the other day for lunch with a co-worker. I'm not a big ""hot dog"" guy...in fact, I haven't had a hot dog in ages....

I ordered two hot dogs all the way with fries....
The hotdogs were AWESOME..!! Maybe it's because I haven't had them in a while...but it's more likely that they are just that damn good! 

The fries: I LOVE crinkle cut fries....so simple, but yet so good!!

If your in the area and can't decide on what to eat for lunch...walk on over to Green's...great bang for your buck...

I also saw that they have a breakfast menu...I will be stopping by one of these days for a quick breakfast sandwhich..."
"NC","This is one of those places where the hype is bigger than reality.  Sure, it's an institution of a business that somehow survived the times without changing the decor for decades.  But the hot dogs aren't impressive at all, I was actually quite disappointed by them.  

In my order, I got two Carolina Style Dogs (mustard, onions, slaw and chili), with fries and a drink.  The drink is inundated with tons of ice, which quickly waters down any flavor the soda may have had.  The fries were so-so, nothing fancy about crinkle-cut.  The dogs were disappointing... since the hot dogs are cooked in a water pot, they should be dried off a little before putting in the bun; well, they didn't do that and I had a soggy buns as a result.  The slaw and chili didn't have any real flavor to them and probably would have been better without because of the mess.  Overall, I couldn't finish both dogs because it got too messy and tasted blah with the wet bun.

Honestly, I have had better hot dogs from the Green's lunch cart located in front of Wells Fargo than the actual location.  Prices are the same, cheap, and that lady doesn't mess around with soggy buns.  If you want Green's lunch, go to the cart, not the establishment.  Overall, there are better hot dog places in Uptown, though will cost more."
"NC","You haven't really been to Charlotte until you've been to Green's. Obviously they're known for the hotdogs, but breakfast at this place is a spectacular deal. You can get a full plate of eggs, grits, sausage/bacon and toast for about $3.75 and it's delicious. Awesome breakfast sandwiches as well. I don't know of anyone else in uptown Charlotte who can pull that off."
"NC","I'd heard lots of hype about Green's, but I have to say I was a little let down. To be sure, the atmosphere is cool--it's a classic diner-like hot dog joint, and it's been here forever.  But the food wasn't what I was hoping for. 

I got a hot dog, a grilled cheese, and fries.  For all the talk about the hot dogs, I was expecting something more than average.  But average is what I got.  There are plenty of better hot dogs out there.  The grilled cheese was good, but it's kind of hard to mess that up.  The fries were not very good. 

All of that said, I'll still give Green's three stars, based mostly on price and charm."
"NC","Great hot dogs and prices, friendly staff also. Go to lunch here a few times a month."
"NC","I used to eat here all the time when I worked closer to them.  I haven't been in an easy 10 years but went the other day for kicks and it was just as good and basically the same inside the place as it was the last time I was there.  Got two dogs all the way and a glass of water and I think I got out of there for around $4.50."
"NC","If you're looking for that good 'ol skinny dog in a steamy hot bun, lovingly draped with chili and mustard then this is your spot.  It's the only thing we've eaten here and the dogs have that baseball park comforting goodness.  The people who work here are sweet and the place is clean.  Hit it up if you want some dogs!!"
"NC","Little confused here.. tried to get a hot dog from the cart outside the Fargo last week, when the lady saw me coming (she was on her cell phone) she hid behind the grill and didn't address me, so I walked away and went to another dog stand... is this the way they normally do business with the hot dog cart??"
"NC","Old school Charlotte.  Simple, straight forward , comfort food.  The hot dogs are average.  Their burgers  ANY BURGER-  is great.  I usually get a chili cheese burger.  Their breakfast is very, very good.  For the price, you really cannot beat this place."
"NC","Old school diner, known for chili-dogs

Most of the reviews here are on point.   We were there early so mostly had breakfast which was darned good.  I was not all that impressed with the chili-dogs frankly (sorry...pun).  ""Lost in time"" type of diner.  Def worth a shot if you've never been."
"NC","A tour of uptown wouldn't be complete without stopping for some gut-busting fare from Green's Lunch. Swung in here today with some coworkers and I ordered a grilled cheese (add tomato...which makes it healthy), onion rings and a Coke. So all-American.

My compatriots ordered hot dogs. We got out of there for under $13. 3 people. Lunch. No joke.

At first glance, you realize this is a super divey place, with photos from the 80s, BOB award certificates and framed newspaper articles. It smells a little...you know, just how you'd expect.

Service is quick and they move people in and out pretty seamlessly. Apparently they're known for their hot dogs. I didn't partake, but if I were into eating animal...parts, I would have.

I hear the chili is stellar, and the onion rings were crispy and delicious. More of a smooth casing batter for the onion rings, and I saw that the fries were crinkle cut.

I mixed up a little of the Texas Pete (on every table) with ketchup and used it as my dipping sauce for the rings. Spot on.

A true Charlotte staple. Definitely stop by and grab lunch sometime soon! It's quick, cheap and seasoned with just the right nostalgia."
"NC","Two dogs all the way, fries and a water for around $5.50. Can't beat the prices. I've had the burgers and would rate them as just ok but they are famous for hotdogs so what would you expect. Breakfast is also pretty good.

Definitely worth a try if you've never been there."
"NC","For our last lunch in Charlotte, we headed downtown to Green's Lunch.  I was drawn by several reviews of the chili dogs and Ms T could always get another cheeseburger.

These were excellent, straightforward, nothing fancy, southern style, chili dogs and I liked them very much.  The chili is very fine with good flavor and a hint of heat.  The soft textured, well flavored hot dog is served in a soft white bun.  This is a classic Southerner.  I added slaw, which was finely ground, but pretty bland, although it did not mask the chili.  My extra slaw I doctored with Texas Pete and salt.  I wolfed down two dogs and certainly could have had another one or two, but stopped.

Ms T had a cheese burger which is not as good and I recommend you get the chili dogs here.  We were a little late, approaching 1:00pm.  The burger patty was pre-cooked, sitting in broth.  She reported it was a pre-formed patty, not really seasoned and of course not freshly cooked.  Oh well, her loss, she needs to learn to eat chili dogs."
"NC","One of the oldest hotdog / hamburger joints in Charlotte. Burgers and hotdogs are fresh and made to order. Charlotte Classic"
"NC","Quick service, delicious food. Very casual, great place to go Uptown for a quick bite to eat."
"NC","I almost hate writing this review, because Green's is such a Charlotte institution. I almost feel like I'm dissing my adopted city by saying this, but I just don't see what the big deal is about this place. When I first moved here everyone talked about how the hot dogs were as good as The Varsity in Atlanta. News tip: they aren't, and they aren't by a longshot. What's worse, the three or four times I've eaten there the food has been lukewarm and inconsistent. Maybe the hot dog is cold, but the chili is hot. I dunno... I WANT to like this place, but just can't."
"NC","I try to eat healthy on most days, but sometimes you just want to be bad and scarf down a couple chili dogs. This is the place to go to fulfill that urge. 

Green's is a Charlotte institution. An old school lunch counter that also offers burgers, sandwiches, crinkle fries, onion rings, etc... but the dog is the way to go here. Unless you are my pal Eddie, who swears by the livermush sandwich here.

It's nothing fancy. Just a lunch spot where you can get a hot dog done right. I suggest getting it slathered in Green's homemade chili.

There is a parking lot next to the building. It is a pay lot. I recommend parking on the street and feeding the meter instead.

I guess my only real complaint about Green's is that it's not open on Sundays, unless the Panthers are at home."
"NC","I have been going to Green's for 40 years and I haven't found a better dog yet! I have found some that were close though. There are a few folks that have mentioned on here that  the chili is from a can. I know for a fact that their chili is homemade! If it is from a can maybe someone can email me and tell me which brand it is so I can buy it. The things I like about the dogs are the steamed buns. That way they are moist and practically melt in your mouth. The franks are boiled and they are fat and juicy. 
The onions are a sweet type like vidalia and they are choped real fine so they aren't lumpy. I usually get 2 all the way with a Pepsi. If you are looking for a really good hot dog I say give them a try and if you know of a better place let me know!"
"NC","These are not the best hot dogs on the planet but they're probably the best, cheapest hot dogs on the planet.

You can get 2 hot dogs for the price of what you would pay for just one at somewhere like Five Guys. I get it simple: chili only. There's Texas Pete on the table to give it that extra kick. Some say that it's can chili, but it's some damn good can chili if that's the case. I only wish they had some decent onions for it. They always tasted freezer-burned whenever I've had them. 

Fries are so-so of the crinkle-cut, frozen variety and onion rings are ""pretty good"", not great. 


Your pal,
Walter
The place is somewhat of a ""hole-in-the'wall"" but those are usually among the best places to eat. (I want to steal that old cartoonized-map of Charlotte on the wall.)

Great ice!"
"NC","Felt like it was overrated, and anytime something has hype, it never lives up to my exaggerated standards.  That said, I don't think you should go anywhere else if you have a hankering for hot dogs.

Colleague and I took a short trek to Green's Lunch from Trade/Tryon and had a sit down there.  Tried to talk business and stuff, but let's face it, with two chilli dogs, onion rings, fries and crushed ice,  the only things being settled were when we'd head over here next time.  Food was great, prices dirt cheap and it's an old school spot. 

Love the slaw smack dab in the middle.  Beware of food coma even if you don't grub a lot.

dmo out"
"NC","A stone's throw from Bank of America Stadium (I would say a hail mary pass away, but no Panther's QB's could complete it), on 4th Street, is a little slice of Americana known as Green's Lunch.  That is exactly what they serve.  Lunch.
On the outskirts of the hustle and bustle portion of uptown proper and before you get to the over-priced parking lot farms that are smattered about the stadium area this little greasy spoon sits unassuming.
Upon walking in, the age of the booths and the wallpaper let you know that this place has been here awhile.  At a glance, I recognized a ""best of Charlotte"" certificate from 1995.  Was that REALLY 16 years ago?!  Man....
The fare is basic.  Hot dogs, burgers, BLTs, sandwiches, fries, onion rings, et cetera.  Exactly what you expect them to accomplish with a two basket deep fryer, a griddle, and a fixins station of sorts.
They are known for their hot dogs.  ""All the way"" means mustard, ketchup, chili, onions, and slaw.  An extra 50 cents and you get some half slices of American cheese underneath all that.  Not bad for a two buck dog.
I would recommend it if you are looking for something off the uptown beaten path, feel like abandoning dietary restrictions, keep some Tums in your desk, and have a pack of gum handy for the afternoon."
"NC","I had two dogs, fries, and a coke for lunch.  The cheese was the individually wrapped American slices torn in 1/2, the bun was your plain white basic variety, the chili right out of a can, and the meat typical. Frankly (haha), it didn't do anything for me.  Because of some of the other stellar reviews, I'll have to give it another try, maybe the green dogs?  Friendly enough with a small town diner ambiance."
"NC","Center of the hot dog universe! Been eating here for 20+ years, never had anything but hot dogs (chili, mustard, and slaw) and french fries. It's the chili that makes this place special. They have other ""stuff"" on the menu, but what's the point?  And, the y have the best crushed ice on the planet. If they ever close the doors, I'm buying the ice machine."
"NC","This small gem has been around since little Herbie Hoover was president, and it serves one of the very finest examples of the Southern Chili Dog  a dish consisting of 2 meats, 2 veggies, and bread, a complete meal.

They serve other things here - burgers, sandwiches, etc - but the hot dog is the prize here, and should be ordered here, and ordered often. The dog is the star of the place, and the thick, meaty chili is the star of the dog. It is the thickest chili I've ever encountered, anf the result is a heavy, delicious dog.

The burger here is ok, but pales next to the dog. The fries should be avoided, little taste or texture. This is a simple, no ambiance diner, a little worn and weary, but worth seeking out. Every time I am in Charlotte near lunch time, the question is here or Price's."
"NC","I had a BLT and cheese fries. The BLT and Cheese fries were ok. I think the thing here is the prices are reasonable (not that cheap for what you get, but reasonable) and the place has been around since 1926 and has the feel of a historic lunch counter. I think that's the cool thing about the place."
"NC","I have been eating at greens since I was a little kid. I still go there with my husband every Saturday that I am in Charlotte. It is a tiny little place that has been there forever but they have the best hotdogs around. The chili is smooth and yummy. They also always make your crinkle fries when you order them, so they are always fresh and hot, never sitting under a heat lamp.  Also, the people that work there are very friendly. We are regulars there and they always welcome us like we are old friends. If you like hotdogs, fries, and drinks with crushed ice, definitely give this place a try next time you are in uptown Charlotte."
"NC","Loved this place.  It isn't the nicest/cleanest place in Charlotte, but it the best bang for your buck.  I love hot dogs and they know how to get it done!! These dogs are delicious!  The green dog is so special because it is so simple.  A long time tradition, this greek owned hot dog joint knows what they are selling.  Give it a try for an el cheapo luncho.. Trust me.

Enjoy.

-Ian M."
"NC","Green's has been here for a long time, and is somewhat of an institution in this city. The hot dogs and burgers are pretty good, with their specialty being ""carolina style"" with chili and slaw. 

Food quality is decent, but the big deal here is price. Super-cheap everything is their motto."
"NC","For fun in Center City, Charlotte Center City Partners has it covered!

Yes, these are the folks largely responsible for the big ole event Uptown. Whether it's Beer, Blues & BBQ, Taste of Charlotte, Speedstreet or pumpkin carving for Halloween - I give these guys credit. Considering only 10-12K people live in Uptown, they have a large feat of bringing the masses into Center City. 

As a whole, these events are well organized, nicely promoted and generally a really good time. Stephen puts it well - every event won't be for everybody, but I appreciate that they try to bring Charlotte together (as we're a large group of transplants). In addition to the events, they also send out a really great calendar of what's going on in Uptown & South End every week. If you don't get it already, definitely check it out."
"NC","Festivals. Fun. Beer. Lots of beer. Charlotte Center City Partners (or Find Your Center) puts on a lot of these types of festivals Uptown and in South End. When you check out their website or their weekly newsletter you'll be able to see lots of events coming up like Beer, Blues and BBQ, Taste of Charlotte, Speedstreet and the like. 

Many of these events and festivals usually have beer available, hence why I'm a fan. And, yeah, I also really like supporting the local organization that's responsible for Uptown's development. If only there was a PBR festival...!"
"NC","They are undergoing a change to their rewards program, be VERY careful that they moved your rewards over, I am missing a LOT of drinks. 

The selections of coffee is good, like that they have almond milk and a variety of sugar free syrups. They will also sell whole bottles of syrup, which I really appreciate!

Baked goods are usually fresh and I like that you can get plain oatmeal or jazz it up with certain toppings. 

Staff seems to turn over quickly, which I dislike, but they are typically friendly hipsters who take pride in making a great drink."
"NC","Jackson's Java is hidden in the lobby of Wells Fargo 3. It is a deviation from your typical Starbucks/Dean & Deluca but it doesn't have a local coffee shop feel either. The bagels and pastries are all decent store bought items. They offer a wide variety of espresso drinks and teas. The reason for the middle of the road star rating is the inconsistency. Sometimes my drink tastes great and other times its on the border of undrinkable. I don't understand it, but it is consistently inconsistent. They have a hard time handling the rush too and tend to get behind/have to triple ask orders."
"NC","Located next to the lobby area of Well Fargo 3, this little coffee shop is fantastic. They always seem to have unique roasts from the world's most popular coffee regions. I'm not sure who does the roasting or where they buy their beans but it is easily better than Caribou and Starbucks.
I have only had two of the pastry offerings and they were also worth the money as a breakfast. It is kind of tucked away but if you are on that side of Uptown, consider trying to find it. You won't be disapointed."
"NC","From the burned up bagels to the Stepford Wives, glazed over look of the staff, I will no longer be degrading myself by going to Jackson's Java. Today was the last straw. After paying for my muffin (with nobody else in line mind you) the staff began to chit chat, all the while I just stood there with my hands folded and no muffin. By the time someone uttered ""What's he waiting on"" I had already began my exit. Fair food, fair coffee, horrible customer service, I would recommend seeking out the nearest Starbucks and avoid Jackson's Java like the plague."
"NC","Very delicious coffee and very friendly service. I had the red eye (coffee with an espresso shot) with the dark exotica blend."
"NC","ok ok ok.... (I am a ""give'm a couple tries 1st kinda guy) so, I made my way over to grab some kinda of warm pick-me up during this soggy, melancholy, grey day. 

No lines, I ordered a Chai tea something.

I asked the guy behind the counter, ""Whats up with a secret card society ""S.E.S"".. The guy laughed his butt off. I said i've been here a few times and noticed a few people using them. Asked him is it some type of ""Fight Club"" thing? What do i have to do to get one.

He was clutching his stomach at that point.

Anyway, he gave me one. (still don't know what it does) and rang me up. I left with a ""customer card"" (see picture), cup of Jo, and still unsure what I asked for in this card. 

I guess i'll tape up my hands, do push ups and wait to see. 

lol

go enjoy!!"
"NC","While sitting outsite this location (Wells Fargo Bld 3) It came across my mind that I could write a review about my 1st, 2nd to last vistit, and my last visit. While searching YELP to see if it has reviews.. I notice IT DIDN'T under the name on its sign. 

---JACKSON'S JAVA COFFEE HOUSE---

Well I came back to the office to see if i could pull it up on my CPU instead of PHONE. Well low and behold. Here's some reviews.. for JACKSON'S JAVA. (hmmmm wonder if they are the same, or some ez Close-to name knock off. (if you ever seen Coming To American... McDowells vs McDonalds)... anyway

Well, I work around the area and desided to come by a few months ago. 

1st trip... new ""rookie""
2nd to last trip.... (about 2 weeks ago).. I ordered, Waited, Watched (ppl come in with some sort of VIP card)  and Wondered 

(** are you keeping count.. thats 3 Ws**)
 
what all they fuss about this card this guy and the next lady had. Welll, I didn't ask. (I don't come often enough to really care) but thought it was some secret coffee society type thing.

*** My last vist (as in the last time I went, NOT the last time I'll go) I stopped in for some Chi Tea.... pretty good. 

The service is always ""friendly"", quick, and the to point. 
Prices are good.
Its a little tight when crowded.

Go Enjoy

"NC","Very functional spot is what I would call this place.  Located in Wells Fargo 3 on the way out to the Green or Aquavina. 

They have a couple coffee varieties every day as well as muffins (YUM lemon poppyseed!!!) and store bought bagels.  The prices are cheap and the service is friendly and quick.  There are a few tables to chat or you can chat in the wide hall outside.  They sell cereal too!!!  How fun!"
"NC","Working in uptown you have several options for coffee and they are all big name franchises. Starbucks, Caribou, Einstein and Dunkin. While I do love most of these other coffee places, Jackson's is completely different! They offer baked goods and pastries but what I go there for is the coffee. They have different specialty blends every day and their coffee is always flavorful and rich. They are located in one of the Wells Fargo (formerly Wachovia) buildings on the way to the green if you're cutting through over street. If you have to go to the convention center for a meeting or seminar this is the best place to stop and pick up a cup of Joe. Jackson's only has one other location and that's in the University area near UNCC. Like Angel mentioned they do have plenty of seating in the hall. Because more people are addicts of the stabucks and caribou if you need sugar and cream in your coffee you aren't as pressured from people behind you to get away from the coffee bar."
"NC","Since I started working in the area about 4 weeks ago, I run over to Jackson's Java about 3 times a week around 2:00 or 3:00 PM for an afternoon fix to get me through the work day.  It is a nice alternative to the typical Starbucks with a large selection of bagels, muffins, scones & biscotti.  

The menu includes hot cocoa, warm milk & tea as well as a smoothie selection.  Within the shop itself, it is not the kind of place you bring your laptop or book and stay a while. However it is in the Wachovia building which offers several different seating areas & several tables for lounging."
"NC","Didn't see too much in particular that I loved about this place. It is very small, and is truly a ""grab and go"" kind of place amongst the shops in Uptown. Considering all of the other coffee shops in the area you can find, I would probably skip here and go somewhere else."
"NC","The Dunhill is my favorite hotel in uptown Charlotte. A historic boutique hotel where the object is to please. This warm, cozy hotel is reminiscent of by-gone days in all but the amenities. It's close to the Blumenthal performing arts center and many good restaurants. If exercise is your thing, while they don't have a fitness center on site, you can visit the Charlotte YMCA at no  charge and it's within walking distance and one of the nicest Y's you will find."
"NC","Perfect. Cocktails in the bar. Room service for breakfast. The suite was beautiful. Romantic. NYE already booked. Great location and plenty of things to do without having to get in your auto. We could live at this hotel. 8-) This is not the typical chain hotel....That is a great thing."
"NC","This review is just for the bar, as I am local and live in Charlotte.  I highly recommend locals and hotel guests alike to stop into the Dunhill bar for a drink.  Pete, the bartender, is the BEST and will take good care of you!  He mixes up some amazing cocktails and provides spot-on recommendations if you need them."
"NC","If I could give 10 stars I would!  This hotel went above and beyond when my Uncle fell ill and had to be hospitalized while visiting Charlotte.  They used their London Cab to come and pick us up at the hospital even though it was out of their cab range.  They also gave me a discounted rate on another room so I could stay in Charlotte and take care of my Uncle.  Now on to the hotel itself, it is gorgeous!  The rooms are spacious and so quiet.  I didn't hear a peep from any of my neighbors in the two different rooms I stayed in.  The complimentary breakfast is on point!  Look no further if you are looking for a place in Charlotte that will make you feel like you are part of their family."
"NC","Better service than any hotel I have been to, in all honesty! Dunhill Hotel is classic - from the concierge to the lobby bar. I almost made a reservation at a chain hotel, but am SO GLAD we changed to Dunhill Hotel. Great location for walking around the city, going to a show at the theater, enjoying the Epicentre, etc., and it has history! Also, they provided refreshments in our mini fridge at no cost, and a wonderful complimentary breakfast at the Asbury, which is connected. Awesome breakfast! 

The room was not huge, but was just right for 2 people.

On our first night and after driving 4 hours to get there, the bartender saw it was raining heavily and they were out of umbrellas, so she gave us her own to borrow while we walked to dinner. And after that, the complimentary shuttle took us to the concert at no charge; we just gave a tip. It worked out perfectly for us and saved us some money!

Love this place - and would go back again to enjoy the city and stay again. Kudos."
"NC","We booked through Hotwire while in town for a bowl game under their hot rate, so you don't know what hotel you get until after you pay for it.  Let's just say if you like small rooms with a small bed, in a small historical hotel with only apx 65 rooms then this is your place.  They had no king size beds or rooms with two double beds available in the rooms they had left.  Location was decent, but prefer to be closer to the action near more restaurant selection."
"NC","Cute, boutique hotel that is reminiscent of a bed and breakfast in the middle of the city.

This hotel is incredibly clean, cozy, and rich with history. And while my room was not flashy in any way (my room reminded me of a nice guest room of a cottage) I have to admit that the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on at a hotel! Additionally, the location is incredibly convenient since you're in the heart of uptown Charlotte.

If you're a frequent hotel hopper, keep in mind of a few luxuries lacking:

1) Dated temperature control - old school dial that was difficult to adjust kept me sweating at night. 

2) No room service or mini bar, but there were a few complimentary waters and sodas in the fridge that were welcome for guests to enjoy. 

Overall, I have no complaints with service and my experience, but since I stay in so many hotels I think I had higher expectations and anticipated a personal touch that may not be present at some of the larger hotels."
"NC","My husband and I visited the Dunhill, originally planning to spend our wedding night there. They are historic, quaint, and conveniently located in Charlotte. Walking in to the check-in desk was a breeze. Everyone was very friendly. Walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel. It really could use some restoring. The hotel room was small, bathroom was small as well (though they've tried to modernize it with decoration & hardware), and just overall underwhelming. The ceiling had many water spots where water had leaked from above and dried the ceiling yellow. They also have a restaurant in the hotel with good eggs benedict, but for the price, I wasn't impressed. Again, friendly, great historic hotel (which I normally love), but didn't live up to its reputation for us. (We visited before our wedding and booked a room at the Ritz, which in Dunhill's defense, was brand spankin' new.)"
"NC","We spent the ""first"" night of our honeymoon at the Dunhill due to an overnight layover before heading to the tropics. We wanted a hotel with some character and history and found both in the Dunhill. The Dunhill is historic which means it's not the most up-to-date hotel, but it has charm and special quirks such as fresh cookies and milk delivered to your room in the evening! The hotel is located in the heart of Charlotte and just steps from your door, you'll find museums, bars and plenty of restaurants. 

Check-in was seamless and the staff was very friendly. They have a hotel bar and a hotel restaurant, along with complimentary coffee and cookies by the front desk. We also got complimentary wi-fi during our stay. We were only at the Dunhill a short while, but while we were there, our stay was delightful and a great spot to stay during our lay-over!"
"NC","I really enjoy this hotel. I've stayed here a few times now and it's very comfortable. The first time I stayed, I told the front desk it was my first time in Charlotte and they gave me a corner room on one of the top floors so I could have a great view of the city. This time I'm in a regular room -- view isn't as nice and the bathroom is much smaller than the last time, but the room itself is nicer, with a couch and coffee tale so I don't mind. Super helpful staff too! 

The only reason I took off a star is because I do this some things could be a little cleaner. The bedding, sink and shower were spotless, but sometimes the towels are ratty and the curtains have a stain or two. Not a huge deal, but it's still something I noticed. I'll stay here each time I come to Charlotte."
"NC","Location is amazing- short walk to anything and everything in uptown Charlotte. There's a bar in the lobby as well as a separate restaurant. They have renovated the entire inside of the hotel- our room was gorgeous with antique furniture- and it was CLEAN! The bathroom had all white marble, granite counter tops, and a large glass shower. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We had a small issue with being overcharged on our bill upon checkout, but it was quickly cleared up. 

This hotel has a boutique feel with wonderful service and quality product, all at a very reasonable price. We will definitely return when we visit Charlotte again!"
"NC","This hotel is nothing special (for my purposes), but the location is great for downtown Charlotte and there were no horrible aspects to it.  

The bathroom setup is stupid (like many hotels) with no counter for the sink and those old-fashioned separate hot and cold water knobs that make calibrating the temperature needlessly difficult.  The shower pressure was adequate, but there is no place in the shower to put your shampoo, soap, washcloth, etc.  That's just dumb.  Toilet paper sconce is behind you and a pain to reach.  An overall bad layout, design, and decor in the bathroom.

The room is very dark with just some dim lamps scattered around the room.  There is a desk, but its shape makes it painful to sit at (there was a wooden part jabbing into my legs) and you have to unplug something if you want to plug in a computer, a short sighted setup on their part.  Because I was here for work I was too busy to eat their breakfast or spend any time at the bar, but I did need to get some stuff done in the room and the above features made that difficult and unpleasant.  

Also, you have to park in a public lot behind the hotel and get your ticket validated by the staff to not pay there, but you still pay Dunhill $12 per day for the parking.  Not convenient, and one time I forgot to get the thing validated and therefore ended up paying more than just paying the garage itself.  Bad system there too.

But overall the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet and getting around is easy.  As a business traveler I'd still prefer a Fairfield Inn or Holiday Inn Express, but this place is almost as good."
"NC","Full disclosure - I have never stayed at this hotel but it does look lovely.  So why am I here?  To pay homage to the bar!  Dunhill Hotel has the best lemon drop martini in Charlotte.  It simply must be said!  The bartenders are wonderful as well.  I'll be back Dunhill!"
"NC","Stayed there for the first time while attending a trade show at the convention center.  Although it's not the closest, it is still within easy walking distance.

The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The only problem I had was the lack of a valet at the valet parking when I arrived late (near midnight).  Self parking was easy enough to figure out.

It is a historic hotel, so some of the rooms have a funky layout.  The decor is traditional, but clean and comfortable. Also quiet.  I was in a room next to the elevator and never heard it.

I really appreciated the fact that I never felt nickled and dimed.  Complimentary soft drinks in the room and coffee in the lobby (no bottles of water with a $3 ""convenience fee"" like some other hotels).  If you get a rate with breakfast it covers a real breakfast, not just coffee and a muffin.

There is an onsite restaurant, The Harvest Moon Grille.  The selection is sometimes limited, but all the food is outstanding.  Fresh local ingredients are highlighted.

 Overall, a nice change of pace from the large luxo chains, and a great place to experience Charlotte hospitality."
"NC","I've stayed here some time ago so I'll keep this short because it and the staff may have changed.  As I remember the staff was very attentive much like a 5 star hotel but for me personally I wasn't digging the old traditional style decor.  In full disclosure, the stay wasn't planned by me, so I probably would have steered clear had I made the plans.  All that aside, it's a fine hotel to unwind for a romantic weekend and take in all that is uptown Charlotte and the history of the place is pretty cool as well.  I don't think there is another hotel downtown that has been there as long as the Dunhill."
"NC","Stayed here about a month ago.  This was really a great hotel.  It's very classic feel, but with brand new bedding, TV, and bathrooms so no old dirty feeling in the rooms.  The employees were super nice, I found a good rate online making it a bargain for downtown.  This is where I'll stay next time I'm in Charlotte."
"NC","Very nice hotel! A friend of mine stayed here last night & had me come through.  I had always wondered about this hotel, since just based on the outside, it looked as if it had been there for a while.  And it has! Since 1929...

The rooms are very nice & spacious, with nice, comfy beds & a neat seating area.  The bathroom though is what's really nice! The shower is HUGE walk in, with tile & an all glass door.

It also boasts nice flat screen tvs.  

A nice bar area awaits you downstairs in the lobby.

This hotel is definitely ""old world charm"" with a touch of modern."
"NC","beautiful historic hotel in the most fun place in all of Charlotte, NC. Service was awesome and what else could I say except ""I'll be back!"""
"NC","Very nice boutique hotel in building with a long and interesting history. Not usually what my wife and I spring for, but we are glad that we did!  We stayed in a ""Vintage Queen"" room which was more than we expected!  Furniture all appeared antique, bathroom finishes very nice. Mini fridge with complimentary water and soda was a nice touch. This really felt more like a B&B than a hotel! 

Using AAA discount, this room was a touch over 100/nite for weekend. You can NOT beat that rate!  This rate also included breakfast each morning in the Harvest Moon Grille (attached/owned by hotel). Oh, parking is easy in the garage behind the place 12/day, again, not too shabby!  We would certainly stay here again if in Charlotte!"
"NC","This place is great. It's an old building but they really make it work and don't fight their limitations at all.  It's well located, there's a bar in the lobby (watch yourself, that guy pours em stiff), and the staff give a crap.  The only drawback is the parking situation ...and it's a little hard to actually drive to the building itself, given the whole ""crazy series of one-way streets"" in downtown Charlotte.  But yeah, I thought it was fantastic all around - oh, and the price for it all is great."
"NC","This is an excellent, boutique hotel for anyone who has business or pleasure travel in Uptown Charlotte. It's right in the heart of the uptown commercial district, so if your business is there, you can park the car and walk to your destination. 

The accommodations are beautiful and comfortable. The staff is friendly and fairly formal, but not over-the-top. I've heard the hotel restaurant is great, and features ingredients from local farms, but I haven't tried it yet. 

The Dunhill is not cheap but my company has a group rate which I am happy to take full advantage of. And I also prefer an independent, boutique hotel over a nondescript chain."
"NC","Great experience. Fantastic customer service and great amenities. There aren't many hotels now-a-days that give you free bottled water, free access to a local gym, and free wi-fi. Rooms are clean and well maintained. I would definitely stay here again."
"NC","An intimate hotel whose charm and sophistication is matched by outstanding service.

I recently visited Charlotte on a family vacation and had the pleasure of staying two nights at the Dunhill.  This is a historic building set in the middle of downtown Charlotte, within walking distance to many restaurants and attractions.  The staff was beyond friendly.  I have stayed at many Ritz Carltons, Four Seasons, Mandarin Orientals, etc.. and I can say that this was one of the best experiences I have had in terms of customer service.  When I called down to the desk to ask about a nearby pharmacy- they offered to drive me!  It was only a few blocks but in December it was nice to take a ride in the warm London cab they have.  The rooms are well appointed with comfortable beds, newer furnishings, and flatscreen televisions.  If I ever find myself back in Charlotte I will definitely return.  I can not recommend this hotel highly enough."
"NC","Great bar, nice atmosphere"
"NC","The last remaining independently owned hotel in Uptown Charlotte. Sad, but true.

While it may not be quite as high-falootin' as it was even 10 years ago, this is where I send out of town guests in need of a full service hotel. The rates have gotten somewhat reasonable as of late, which makes it accessible to middle-class peons like myself and my brethren. 

Old school is a good description of the whole shebag - although the rooms have been recently updated and are comfily redone. Beds are soft enough but not too much. They have large flat screens for those Law + Order-binge hotel stayers (like myself). The rooms on the upper floors have had their bathrooms completely remodeled - very modern, marble, with those slighty-freaky belly button-level spray things, I no likee but I guess some do. 

But the bar's in the lobby, the bartender's got some weird 6 button vest on, there's a huge ball of floral arranging changed daily in the middle of the retro-greecian-baroque Bowling Alley carpeted entryway, and the staff is slightly stuffy, adding to the whole old-money feel. Plus, for all their staff's scatterbrainedness, the Monticello (and now, the Harvest Moon Grille) is a great place to grab a dinner or brunch. 

Free parking even if you're just there to grab a well-made Martini. Awesome."
"NC","What a fabulous place! Great  place, great location, wonderful staff, excellent food, great value too. And here's the best part: This is independently owned. It's making it on its own--no soulless corporation bleeding it for profit. I would come here for a fun weekend even if I lived in Charlotte. Do yourself a favor and stay here."
"NC","just what i look for in a hotel. 

history. 

location.

service.

amenities.

and originality.  

the rooms were appointed well, the building maintained perfectly, the staff excellent, and a welcome respite from all the cookie cutter chain hotels."
"NC","Absolutely the best and most elegant hotel in Uptown Charlotte and the only one with any historic character.  Truly a landmark, I have stayed here on several occasions myself and it gets my highest recommendation to all my visiting friends.  In a previous career, we put all our visiting executives and VIPs up at the Dunhill, knowing they'd have a good experience. 

As a professional photographer, I worked a couple of weddings and a birthday party here.  The Dunhill is perfect for those occasions because of it's unique architecture (the penthouse can't be beat for a bridal suite), restaurant, proximity to other amenities, and friendly staff.  I always coordinated with Kandace Stafford in events, who is on the ball and will make sure you are well taken care of."
"NC","We arrived at the Dunhill from the airport at crazy-o-clock, east coast time (that's midnight, ya'll).  The staff were impressively attentive, held the door for me, helped us into our room, when there was a key mixup (the key to our door did not work) they quickly assisted us.  The interior of the Dunhill is elegant and well-appointed.  The interior bar stays open late, so if you don't feel like freezing your tail off (it was twenty degrees the night we stayed over) you can warm yourself with a bourbon in the lobby.

The oldest hotel in Charlotte feels old in a good way - it's not outdated or dirty or sketchy or infested with anything but good cheer and southern charm.  The staff is amazing - really amazing and helpful, even for the late arrivals.  This was so refreshing after a very long day of multiple flight connections and shoddy treatment by surly American Airlines staff.

The price was very reasonable - less than $90 (online special) for one of the nights near Thanksgiving.  The location is perfect should you wish to explore downtown Charlotte - you are smack dab in the heart of things, close to bars, restaurants, and coffeeshops, but far away enough that the noise of the grittier downtown nightclub scene doesn't infringe on your sleeping experience.

So why the three stars?  

The bed in our room was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever encountered in my life.  There was a really deep pit in the very middle that kept my husband and I awake all night as we kept fighting our way out of the sunken pit and over to the edge.  There was no relief.  We both have bad backs - I'm actually in physical therapy for mine - and the bed really set our trip off badly, as it re-injured my fragile muscles and caused me to be in pain for the week of Thanksgiving.  My husband ended up sleeping on the floor.  

If the bed had been even remotely comfortable this would be a five-star hotel."
"NC","This is a quaint historic hotel that has been a part of Charlotte since 1929. I enjoyed staying here though I wished I'd brought ear plugs since I could hear a lot of the street noise outside from our corner room. It was still nice to have our wedding here and then go right upstairs to our room- no driving! We left first thing in the morning for our honeymoon which was a snap since uptown is close to the airport.

WEDDINGS: Also, for anyone considering having a wedding here... Modern Salon is in the Hearst Tower just a block away from the Dunhill. My bridesmaids and myself had our hair done here- they did a nice job and once again- no driving! Oh! AND Flowers Plus who I highly recommend is right down the street (in one of the Wachovia Buildings). They do the Dunhill's flowers and will work with you so the Dunhill's flowers will coordinate well with your wedding flowers. Joel was wonderful to work with.

OUT-OF-TOWNIES: One of the things I appreciated most was the hotel's location. It's within walking distance of everything from the Mint Museum of Arts and Crafts to the Bank of America Stadium. The main library is diagonally across the street. It was really great for guests coming in from out of town who didn't know their way around the city which can sometimes be a bear to navigate for the newcomer. 

DINNER: There are many restaurants just outside the doors if you do not wish to eat at Monticello, the hotel's restaurant. But I would recommend staying for at least one meal. It's delicious! 

AFTERNOON TEA: As good as the restaurant is, I do not suggest having Afternoon Tea there. Unless they have drastically improved since last year, there's nothing good I can say about it. The service for the tea was subpar, to be kind. The sandwiches were on the stale side. The server didn't know that desserts were included and when we finally did get them they were only so-so. The whole thing left me feeling like I had been an inconvenience to the staff since they had no clue what they were to do for a tea.

BACK TO DINNER: But dinner? That's a different story. They do have that cinched up beautifully."
